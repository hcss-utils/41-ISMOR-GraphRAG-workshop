This report examines the causes and likely future trends in proxy wars. More specifically, these reports focus on intrastate proxy wars: civil wars in which at least one local warring party receives support from an external state that could be useful for waging armed conflict, such as funding, arms, equipment, advising, training, intelligence, and/or troops. The report addresses three main questions:
• Why do external states provide military support to parties to a civil war? • Do these motivations provide any indication of whether proxy warfare, and especially proxy warfare by major or regional powers, might increase substantially within the time horizon currently driving longterm U.S. defense planning (i.e., through 2035)? • If a state not currently engaged in proxy warfare were to decide to dramatically expand the geographical reach or military sophistication of its proxy activities, how long would it take that country to develop the necessary capabilities to do so?
The research to answer these questions was conducted in three steps. First, we conducted an extensive review of the existing literature on proxy warfare. Second, we used quantitative analysis to assess trends in and drivers of proxy warfare. Third, we conducted case studies of three of the major powers that have used proxy warfare over the past several decades-Russia (and the Soviet Union before it), China, and Iran-to determine why they had engaged in proxy warfare and, for the periods in which they had turned away from this instrument of competition, why they stopped such practices.
It should be noted that this report was written before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While that war has added urgency to the issue of proxy warfare and the findings and related recommendations in this report remain important, the analysis herein contains no assessment of the events that have occurred during that conflict. Moreover, the long-term impacts of that war on the findings and recommendations developed here remain to be seen.
Why Do States Use Proxy Warfare as a Tool of Strategic Competition?
States engage in proxy warfare for a complex mixture of geopolitical, ideological, domestic political, and economic motivations. Geopolitical and, to a lesser extent, ideological concerns appear to be the primary motives for such conflicts, while domestic political and economic considerations play secondary roles. We summarize our assessment of these factors in five main points.
First, geopolitical considerations appear to be paramount in the decision to provide support to violent nonstate actors (VNSAs), across most actors and at most times. While there are exceptions, the desire to undermine rivals and shift regional balances of power is the most clearly and consistently supported factor in the report. This desire to use proxy warfare in a proactive manner, including in regions far from a state's borders, often has its roots in a reactive concern, driven by acute perceptions of the vulnerability of the state's own security to adversary proxy warfare. However, once states have developed these proxy warfare capabilities, they often use them much more widely than simply to address the initial vulnerability. This pattern was observed across multiple states, including the People's Republic of China under Mao and post-1979 Iran.
Second, while difficult to separate fully from geopolitical considerations, ideological factors also seem to have played an important role for many states in decisions to engage in proxy warfare. Postrevolutionary regimes appear to be more likely to support VNSAs than other states. State ideology is also a crucial factor in shaping which VNSAs most states will consider supporting, from the Iranian focus on Shia groups to the Soviet and Chinese focus on leftist or communist groups. Finally, ideology plays a role in driv-ing the overall perception of threat from a rival that motivates much proxy war activity in the first place.
Third, we found less support for domestic politics as factors motivating states to pursue proxy warfare. We found little evidence, particularly in the case studies, that public attitudes, such as concerns for diaspora groups or particular rebel groups, were an important factor in state decisions to support VNSAs. However, we did see repeated evidence that support to VNSAs is often attractive to policymakers (both in democracies and autocracies) precisely because it avoids, or at least limits, the domestic political costs and scrutiny that would accompany the use of the country's own military forces, especially in large numbers. The fact that states that develop a capability for fighting proxy wars seem to expand their use of this tool over time may also suggest that a bureaucratic mechanism is at play. That is, politically powerful actors within a state's bureaucracy, such as Iran's Quds Force or the siloviki in Russia, may be empowered by initial successes and press to expand their activities.
Fourth, similar to the previous theme, we found considerable evidence that states turn to proxy warfare to lower the economic costs of their efforts to undermine their rivals. However, there is little evidence that the potential for economic gains (e.g., through seizing natural resources and/or the profits that derive from them) plays a large role in most major powers' support for VNSAs (with some notable exceptions).
Finally, despite the lower direct costs of proxy warfare (compared with conventional warfare), it was repeatedly clear in our case studies that there can be considerable indirect costs. Surrogates sometimes turn on the sponsoring state, embarrass it with their behavior, or contribute to undesired levels of escalation between the sponsoring state and its rivals. If the sponsoring state gets drawn more deeply into a direct role in what started as a proxy war, the associated costs can skyrocket. In many cases, sponsoring states terminated particular proxy relationships or turned away from proxy warfare altogether (at least for a period of time) due in part to either these indirect, often strategic costs or the costs associated with getting drawn into more direct roles.
As can be seen in Figure S.1, the use of proxy warfare in the modern era peaked in the late Cold War and declined substantially over the subsequent 20 years. In the post-Cold War era, proxy warfare changed not only in the number of instances but also in the nature of the countries involved. During the Cold War, proxy warfare was often a tool of major powers, such as the United States, Soviet Union, and China. In the post-Cold War era, proxy wars were often used by much weaker, less-capable states.

From a policymaker's perspective, the key question is whether the recent apparent increase in proxy warfare, and especially proxy warfare conducted by more-capable states, is likely to continue in the future. Our analysis suggests a complicated answer, but there are a number of reasons for concern.
With the renewed focus in many regions on strategic competition, there seems to be increasing risk that states will feel increasingly threatened by their rivals and take greater steps to counteract these threats in the years to come. Our case studies highlight how such an environment can often, though not always, lead to an increased interest in supporting proxy warfare. Of even greater concern, geopolitical drivers of proxy warfare can often be self-reinforcing. In the past, regimes that have made widespread use of proxy warfare have typically begun such campaigns out of an acute sense of vulnerability and a lack of other tools that are appropriate (affordable, sufficiently low risk of escalation, and so on). Often the use of proxy warfare expands over time, however, from instances in which it appears clearly defensive (responding to specific threats that are geographically proximate) to much more aggressive, wide-ranging uses of proxy warfare. Furthermore, the use of proxy warfare has historically prompted similar behavior in adversaries and rivals, creating a spiral in which one state's use of the tool increases its use by others. There are also numerous instances of spillover effects, where support for one local proxy leads to support for others in nearby countries (e.g., U.S. support for South Vietnam leading to involvement in wars in Laos and Cambodia, or Iranian support to Lebanese Hezbollah helping to draw Iran deeper into the Syrian civil war). These factors highlight the potential risks that may accompany the apparent recent increase in proxy warfare.
While difficult to disentangle fully from geopolitical factors, as noted above, ideological factors emerged in our case studies as important parts of the explanation for why states have historically pursued robust proxy warfare programs. On this front, the current environment and anticipated trends are not as grim. Neither of the two current major U.S. competitors, China and Russia, has a particularly ideological regime, certainly not in comparison with the regimes of China and the Soviet Union during the earlier Cold War period. Neither represents a globalized ideology with a readymade set of potential partners throughout other parts of the world (and, conversely, potential local partners lack a ready-made ideology to appeal to China or Russia for assistance). Indeed, the main professed ideological difference that China and Russia represent relative to the United States and its allies is a focus on state sovereignty and the continuity of existing governments, regardless of those governments' behavior or treatment of their people. (Russia's activities in Ukraine since 2014 and other activities of both Russia and China justify some skepticism of how sincerely these ideologies are held.) This stated ideology may or may not increase their willingness to provide support to governments in the midst of civil conflicts, but it does not seem likely to increase their interest in providing support to VNSAs.
Our research suggests that economic motivations have often served to restrain proxy warfare by great powers in the past, as major powers concerned about international reaction or instability held back in their support to potential proxies in order to maintain economic growth or access to international markets. There is reason to believe that such motivations are likely to continue to play a restraining role on the decisions of China in particular going forward, as the country continues to become increasingly integrated into the global economy and economically invested in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe through its Belt and Road Initiative. The likelihood that investments in those regions would pay off could be substantially undermined by a widespread resurgence in proxy warfare. This is not to suggest that geopolitical concerns cannot override economic concerns in particular countries or contexts, however. And Chinese economic concerns may themselves become more limited in some countries. If, for example, U.S. efforts to prevent or limit Chinese economic penetration of a country succeeded, perhaps most likely in U.S. allies or partners, then How Long Does It Take States to Develop Capabilities for Proxy Warfare?
Two current U.S. competitors, Russia and Iran, already have sophisticated proxy warfare capabilities. But if China were to reengage in this form of strategic competition, how long might it take Beijing to develop such capabilities again? To answer this question, we distinguish between how quickly a state may be able to initially create a proxy warfare capability and how long it tends to take states to refine that capability and make it more effective or robust.
The states considered in our case studies were usually able to develop at least a rudimentary capability for proxy warfare very quickly, within a couple of years, often building on the capabilities of prior efforts or regimes. Beyond this baseline capability, however, a relatively lengthy period of learning and growth to better develop proxy warfare capabilities appears to be common. Iran, which inherited a substantial proxy support infrastructure from the prior regime, still took years to build relationships and capabilities with groups such as Hezbollah. The Soviet Union took decades to progress from its early focus on coordination with potential partners through Comintern to its later, more robust Cold War capabilities, though this timeline was substantially affected by limited initial Soviet motivation to do so. The United States had a mixed track record of success in its proxy support relationships throughout the Cold War, but it seems clear that by the 1980s it had learned lessons and gained capabilities not present in earlier periods. The early post-1949 Chinese experience of having become highly effective at proxy support relatively quickly therefore appears to be more unusual and is likely a product of the Chinese Communist Party's lengthy experience as a rebel movement itself. For most states, while an initial capability might be stood up relatively quickly, a longer learning curve should be expected for greater proficiency.
The analysis in this report highlights several strategic-level lessons for U.S. national policymakers, including those in the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, focused on strategic competition with China and Russia, as laid out in the recent National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy.
The first lesson to emerge from our analysis is that proxy wars typically impose considerable costs, both on the United States (when it is a participant) and on the other countries involved. Before becoming involved in a proxy conflict, the United States should carefully assess the interests at stake and the risks.
There may well be circumstances in which adversary proxy support threatens important U.S. interests, and a response, either through an escalated level of U.S. proxy support to the affected states or through direct U.S. military intervention, is warranted. To the extent that the United States can avoid or minimize such situations without sacrificing vital national interests, however, it should do so. Seeking to establish limits or "rules of the road" in strategic competition, such that leaders of other countries do not feel an acute sense of threat from the United States to the security of their states or regimes, could mitigate what has historically been the key motivation for states to expand proxy warfare and, in turn, reduce the likelihood that the United States will be directly drawn into such potentially costly conflicts. Where non-vital U.S. interests are threatened, the United States also has a wide range of indirect military and nonmilitary instruments, such as economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, with which it can impose lesser costs on other major powers that employ proxy warfare with-out the same risks of military escalation. Though the effectiveness of such tools may be limited, they may nonetheless represent important leverage in more-peripheral contexts.
One potential counter to the use of proxy warfare is the ability to publicize the role of outside powers in a conflict. States often pursue proxy relationships precisely because of their greater deniability, both internationally and at home. To the extent that the U.S. government can establish the nature and extent of these relationships publicly, it can help undercut one of the key benefits that states seek in choosing proxy warfare and potentially reduce its attractiveness and frequency. While information that the United States can collect to understand these relationships at a private or classified level can be helpful for policymakers, by itself it lacks the benefits that could accompany public attribution. Additional investments in capabilities designed to uncover such information in ways that could be publicized without compromising vital sources and methods would therefore be useful. Such investments might be either direct (such as through U.S. technical means) or indirect (such as through information-sharing with partners).
Recognizing that the United States may not be able to avoid or deter all instances of adversary support to VNSAs in strategically important countries, the United States can also help prepare countries that are vulnerable or likely to be targeted by such support. The United States should conduct a strategic-level assessment of key U.S. allies and partners that are potentially vulnerable to proxy warfare where additional stabilization support could be provided in advance. The additional support provided by the United States to such countries could include economic development assistance and transportation links for subnational regions with a history or potential for separatist or other grievances. Support might entail diplomatic and political support for reconciliation efforts and political settlements with separatist groups that could become targets for adversary proxy support in the future. Or it could include resources dedicated to improving security governance in at-risk states, especially in states that show a willingness to undertake reforms. In parallel, the United States should also identify countries that  
Around the world, civil wars rage that have been fueled or even caused by the involvement of foreign states pursuing their national interests. For years prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, separatists organized, armed, and directly supported by Russia waged war against Ukrainian government forces. In Yemen, a Houthi rebellion militarily supported by Iran has fought forces supported by Saudi Arabia and (until recently) the Emiratis. Perhaps the most prominent example is the devastating war that began in Syria since 2011, which has drawn in Iran, Turkey, Russia, the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah, and a broad military coalition led by the United States. But these are just the best-known cases of the proxy wars taking place throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, Eurasia, and Africa.
Foreign involvement in civil wars can have serious consequences, especially when foreign powers enter on different sides of the conflict. Such wars typically last longer and are deadlier than those conflicts without such competitive intervention. 1 Even once these wars conclude, the postconflict states 1 On the duration of such wars, see, for instance, Aysegul Aydin and Patrick M.

This report examines the causes and likely future trends in proxy wars. More specifically, the report addresses the following questions:
• Why do external states provide military support to parties to a civil war? Why might they avoid such conflicts or seek a way out of them once committed? • Do these patterns provide any indication of whether proxy wars, and especially proxy warfare by major or regional powers, might increase substantially in the future?
• If a state were to dramatically expand the geographical reach or military sophistication of such activities, how long would it take that country to develop the necessary capabilities?
What Is Proxy Warfare?
Proxy wars refers to wars (and specifically, in this report, civil wars) in which an external state sponsor provides at least one local warring party with support that could be useful for waging armed conflict, such as funding, arms, equipment, advising, training, intelligence, and/or troops, for the purposes of accomplishing some strategic objective. 4 We will refer to the local armed actor, whether a rebel group or government, receiving the support from the external state as a proxy and the relationship between the local actor and the external state sponsor as the proxy relationship.
For a potential intervener, the option of sponsoring a local armed actor is distinct from other tools of intervention (such as direct military operations or economic statecraft, including sanctions or blockades) in several ways. Some of these distinguishing features can be benefits or liabilities for the intervener, depending on the context. Supporting a proxy involves the following actions:
• Delegation to a local actor: Unlike the other intervention options, a proxy strategy cannot be undertaken unilaterally. Sponsoring a local armed actor involves cooperating with or delegating a task to a local partner. This cooperation can range from a relatively hierarchical 4 This definition is similar to those of Karl Deutsch and Andrew Mumford. Karl Deutsch defined proxy war as "an international conflict between two foreign powers, fought out on the soil of a third country, disguised as a conflict over an internal issue of the country and using some of that country's manpower, resources and territory as a means of achieving preponderantly foreign goals and foreign strategies" (Karl W. Deutsch, "External Involvement in Internal War," in Harry Eckstein, ed., Internal War: Problems and Approaches, New York: Free Press of 
Glencoe, 1964)
relationship, in which the sponsor exercises strong influence over the decisionmaking of the proxy, to more-equitable relationships, and it can range from close to very loose coordination. The sponsor may employ some of its own forces directly, but the bulk of the manpower is provided by the proxy. As the next two points make clear, a sponsor typically chooses to rely on proxies to reduce two types of costs: the direct costs (financial costs and casualties) incurred by employing combat power abroad and the potential costs that would arise if the sponsor's involvement causes the conflict to escalate. This two-actor feature, however, has two main costs of its own. For one, setting up the partnership can involve upfront costs in both effort and time, delaying when the strategy can start to see its benefits. Better documented among scholars of proxy warfare is the other, downstream consequence: Because cooperating with another actor requires delegation, the intervener must cede some control of the outcome to another actor, who can act as a veto player or potential spoiler to the state's desired ends. 5 Other intervention options may not incur the costs of cooperation that proxy strategies do, but they also do not benefit from the local knowledge or legitimacy of that local actor, which may be helpful for certain ends. • Investment: A proxy strategy typically requires substantially less investment than direct military intervention, a feature that many studies highlight as a key benefit to the strategy. 6 The logic is that, for the potential intervener, supporting local actors often costs less both in resources and lives than deploying forces, allowing the intervener to sidestep international or domestic criticism or costs. The line between direct and indirect intervention can become blurry, however. In some cases, indirect support may be insufficient to counter a threat, and third parties can become drawn into direct combat. Even in these cases, however, the bulk of the fighting is done by the local parties. • (In)visibility to outside audiences: Sponsoring a proxy actor is less physically visible than direct military action and less public than most diplomacy or economic sanctions, which thrive on a public component. A state sponsor's support for its proxies can therefore be hidden from enemies or its own populace or at least be plausibly denied even if the sponsorship is detected by adversaries. 7 Some proxy relationships are deliberately broadcast or involuntarily outed, but state sponsors and their associated proxy actors still have the option to try to maintain the state's role shrouded in secrecy. Ambiguity about the state's role or culpability in the actions of its proxies can shield the state from international or domestic repercussions (such as conflict escalation), which it might experience if it chose a more public style of intervention. 8 A state committed to keeping the partnership secret is also limited to using only deniable ways of keeping the local partner in line, however.
These characteristics of proxy warfare help to explain both its attractiveness as an instrument of statecraft and its limitations. Because proxies cannot be fully controlled (and, indeed, they not infrequently turn against their one-time sponsors), proxy warfare is not a useful instrument for cases in which the sponsor wants either absolute or fine-grained control of a territory, population, or set of interactions. On the other hand, it can be a highly useful instrument for imposing costs on a competitor or adversary. It can also be used to effect regime change in the target state, although without any guarantees that the regime so created will remain beholden to the former sponsor (as the examples of Soviet-Chinese, Chinese-Vietnamese, and U.S.- 7 Schultz, 2010; Salehyan, 2010; Gleditsch, Salehyan, and Cunningham, 2011.   8 Austin Carson, Secret Wars: Covert Conflict in International Politics, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2018.
Afghan mujahedeen relations all attest). In these senses, it is a tool of coercion more akin to economic sanctions or blockades than to direct warfare.
This report examines foreign sponsor assistance to both states and violent nonstate actors (VNSAs) in violent conflicts, but the focus is on support to nonstate actors. Either type of proxy support can pose threats to the United States. When the United States gets drawn into a proxy war in opposition to a government supported by a foreign sponsor, such actions are typically carried out by relatively small numbers of special operations forces or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) (or the two working together). When the United States gets drawn into a proxy war on behalf of an embattled government against a VNSA supported by a foreign sponsor, however, U.S. support can potentially involve substantial numbers of U.S. Army and other conventional forces. The latter is the principal concern of this report, and, thus, we focus on the threat posed by foreign state support to VNSAs.
Before plunging into the details of our analysis, it is helpful to take a step back to consider how proxy wars have evolved and how they might continue to evolve in the future.
Proxy wars are not a new phenomenon. France used the American colonists as proxies in its struggle against Great Britain in the American war for independence, and Russia used Serbia in its competition with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 9 The prevalence of proxy warfare, however, varies over time. As illustrated in Figure 
1
11
As will be discussed in Chapter 3, in the post-Cold War era, proxy wars changed not only in the number of instances but also in the nature of the countries involved. During the Cold War, proxy warfare was often a tool of major powers such as the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. In the post-Cold War era, proxy wars have often been used by much weaker, poorer states. The Second Congo War of 1998-2003, sometimes called "Africa's World War," was the deadliest of such cases, ultimately involving nine countries and resulting in the deaths of several million people.
In recent years, proxy warfare seems to have changed again. As the examples of Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Ukraine discussed at the outset of this chapter suggest, major powers, including Iran, Russia, the United States, and others, have again been players in these and other civil wars. As might be expected from their involvement, the resources available to both insurgents and governments, including advanced weaponry and military training, have similarly increased. From the perspective of U.S. decisionmakers and military planners, the key questions are whether such conflicts mark the beginning of a resurgence of proxy wars in a new era of strategic competition and, if so, what the defense implications are for the United States.
Scenarios can help defense planners better envision future contingencies and the gaps in military preparedness that they reveal. The most useful scenarios are often not the most likely ones; decisionmakers and planners are often already focused on the contingencies that seem most realistic, given current information. Instead, scenarios can often be most valuable when they focus attention on problems that seem less probable but would represent major challenges if they were to occur. Currently, most discussions of proxy war focus on countries in the Middle East or perhaps in the non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (non-NATO) parts of the former Soviet Union. But what if proxy wars became more common in other parts of the world and came to threaten vital U.S. interests?
To this end, imagine the following scenario: Numerous countries that feel threatened by Chinese economic preeminence and growing military capabilities join the United States in pursuing a policy of "decoupling" their economies from China. Some countries go further, welcoming a substantial U.S. military presence that they had previously sought to avoid. Facing foreign-policy and security reversals and denied its previous instruments of "soft power," Beijing turns to more-aggressive measures to protect its vital interests. 12  In this scenario, a future Philippines turns decisively toward the United States. Galvanized by increasingly assertive Chinese actions, pro-American elements within the military and political establishment sharply curtail market access to China and welcome closer military ties with the United States. 13 Especially after the United States' exit from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the prospect of greater U.S. military access in the Philippines poses a considerable threat to China, which could be within range of ground-based missiles deployed in the Philippines. 14 Lacking the economic leverage it previously possessed because of the Philippines' policy of "decoupling," Beijing responds to the threat posed by close military ties between the United States and the Philippines not with an overt, conven- 12 Although this scenario is purely speculative, others have also suggested that China might turn to more-aggressive action-including potentially proxy warfare-if the United States seeks to isolate it economically. See, for instance, Jeffrey D. Sachs, "Will America Create a Cold War with China?" China Economic Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, 2019.   13 Richard Javad Heydarian, "Tragedy of Small Power Politics: Duterte and the Shifting Sands of Philippine Foreign Policy," Asian Security, Vol. 13, No. 3, 2017.   14 John Reed and Kathrin Hille, "Philippines Warns of China Threat After U.S. Nuclear Pact Exit," Financial Times, 
February 20, 2019.
This specific scenario is unlikely, as are any number of similar scenarios involving other potential U.S. adversaries that might be imagined. However, it is not far-fetched to imagine that U.S. decisionmakers and military planners will be confronted by at least one such situation involving a vital U.S. interest at some point before 2035, the window that the U.S. Department of Defense is currently using for long-range defense planning efforts. How would the United States respond in such circumstances? Scarred by experiences with irregular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (or, going further back, with proxy warfare in Vietnam), would it refuse its partner's entreaties? And if the United States provided weapons, training, and intelligence to its partner, but such assistance was not sufficient to turn the tide against a well-armed, well-trained insurgency, what then? If the United States chose to intervene more directly in support of the Philippine government, it could potentially involve a major commitment of military forces. Understanding the potential for such contingencies is the focus of this report.
This report seeks to identify the factors that might make scenarios like the one above more likely. 16 The remainder of this report is divided into two main parts.
Chapters 2 and 3 examine the causes of external states' support of local proxies in a civil war. Chapter 2 reviews the existing literature on these causes and outlines the research design for the subsequent chapters. Chapter 3 summarizes the results of a statistical analysis of the determinants of state support to proxies. Although the analysis used analytic statistics, Chapter 3 is written for a general audience, with the technical details of the analysis reported in 
Appendix A. Chapters 4,
5,
and 6
The primary objective of this report is to provide insights to the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Army concerning the threats posed by proxy wars and the capability requirements implied by these threats. Because both the Department of Defense as a whole and the Army primarily become involved in proxy wars to combat VNSAs (rather than employing such actors against sovereign states), the focus of this report is on why and how major powers provide support to these nonstate actors. 19 In the case of the qualitative analysis, our exclusive focus is on state support to nonstate militants. In the quantitative analysis, we also take note of when governments provide support to states and the reasons why they might do so, although our focus again remains on nonstate actors.
Chapter 7 synthesizes the findings from the quantitative analysis and case studies and draws lessons for the future, including policy recommendations for the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army.
In modern U.S. doctrinal terms, we focus on the nonstate aspect of proxy warfare that corresponds to unconventional warfare, defined as the capability to "enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area" (see "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016," in Public Law 114-92, Section 1097, U.S. 
Congress, November 25, 2015)
There has been a resurgence of interest in recent years in proxy warfare, prompted in part by concerns such as state support to terrorist groups in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks; Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah's relative success against the Israeli Defense Forces; and Russia's support for the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in Ukraine (marked by the conflict there beginning in 2014). The implications of proxy wars for U.S. defense planning are, however, still highly contested.
This chapter provides background on the first of the two major questions motivating this report. It reviews the literature on the reasons why states engage in proxy warfare in hopes of identifying the factors that will determine whether we might see an upsurge in the number of such conflicts in the coming 15 years. It then provides an overview of the research approach we used in subsequent chapters to understand broad trends in the use of proxy warfare and the specific factors motivating key states.
Our framework breaks down the various arguments for why states may engage in proxy warfare into motivations for intervening and opportunities to intervene through proxy tools. 1 Motivations are factors that inspire states to want to intervene or engage in proxy wars, whereas opportunities are factors that reduce the barriers to using a proxy strategy or make it easier or more advantageous for states to use proxy tools to achieve their ends. 1 Grauer and Tierney take a similar approach to explaining trends of state support for rebel groups over time, although they only highlight a select few hypotheses (Ryan Grauer and Dominic Tierney, "The Arsenal of Insurrection: Explaining Rising Support for Rebels," Security Studies, Vol. 
27, No. 2, 2018)
States can choose proxy strategies for reasons related to geopolitical interests, economic interests, domestic politics, ideology, or identity. We discuss how each of these categories can motivate states and present opportunities for states to engage through proxies. Table 
2
In summarizing these arguments, we draw both from existing research on why states intervene through proxy tools and from the relatively more robust debates on direct military intervention as applied to the unique context of proxy warfare.
The first set of explanations emphasizes the geopolitical and security considerations that underpin decisions to support proxy actors. States can be motivated to intervene for reasons to do with power politics, coercion, alliances, or concerns about conflict spillover, whereas the nature of the local actors and their relationships to rival states and perceived risks of interstate escalation can create or remove barriers to using proxy strategies.
Many scholars and practitioners contend that states engage in proxy warfare to affect the global or regional balance of power, relative to a state rival or rivals. 2 Some states may turn to proxy relationships to chip away at an adversary's power in a region, to impose costs on an adversary, or to assuage a strong sense of insecurity by enhancing their influence abroad. There is no broad agreement, however, about exactly how power-politics affects the use of proxy warfare. Some research indicates that weak states facing a strong rival are more likely than strong states to use proxy strategies, ostensibly because it is a low-cost way to balance against a stronger rival state. 3 Alternatively, some research has found that weaker states facing stronger rivals are less likely to use proxy support. They claim that this is because they fear devastating retaliation for that support, especially through losing control of their proxies. 4 Hegemonic states, in particular, may be more willing to intervene because they face no real pushback to opportunistic meddling, as Idean Salehyan argues, 5 although it is possible that this intervention may take the form of direct rather than proxy interventions, depending on the costs that the hegemonic state is willing to bear. 6 Additionally, if the intervener's rivalry is with the state in question, the intervener is more likely to sponsor local nonstate armed groups. 7  In a dynamic that is related to, but distinct from, traditional theories of power politics, some states may be motivated to sponsor local armed groups 3 Belgin San-Akca, "Supporting Nonstate Armed Groups: A Resort to Illegality?"

States can feel their interests threatened not just by other states but also the presence of instability. Concerns about spillover can affect whether states decide to support actors within an ongoing conflict. A few scholars of military intervention argue that states intervene in some civil wars for fear that violence can spill over into neighboring areas, to which they assign some value. 10 Fear that extremism flourishing in the chaos of a civil war can 8

While some states may be motivated to engage in proxy warfare because of adversaries or threats, others may be inspired by alliance considerations. Alliance motivations could come in various forms. In some contexts, proxy relationships begin because an external state has come to the defense of a long-standing local ally in need by supporting it with arms, advisers, funding, and more. Iranian and Russian support for the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, U.S. support for the Iraqi government following the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and Saudi Arabia's support for the ousted Hadi regime in Yemen are some examples of this dynamic. In another alliance dynamic, a state may bandwagon with an ally that has already intervened to curry favor with that ally.

The presence of a viable local ally could serve as an opportunity for a state to pursue its goals through a proxy strategy. A local armed actor that exhibits characteristics that serve the state's geopolitical goals, such as being strong enough to win, or at least threaten to win, the conflict, would make proxy strategies more attractive. 13 Opportunities to engage in proxy warfare may also appear more attractive when the risks that employing a proxy strategy will escalate into interstate war are low. 14 Certain conditions may make escalation risks from proxy strategies easier to manage, therefore reducing the barriers to using the option. An intervener may assess a lower risk of escalation if a rival state is not directly involved in the war. Similarly, states may see the absence of a rival as an opportunity to pursue their economic, domestic, or ideological goals (see the following sections in this chapter) through proxy intervention without the burden of possible escalation.
Even when a rival is directly involved in the war, a potential intervener may still be undeterred from proxy warfare if it assesses that its proxy strategy can sufficiently avoid direct confrontation with an enemy in the same theater, whether because the interventions are not actually at crosspurposes, the intervener can deny its involvement, or the intervener believes that the rival is unwilling or unable to escalate. For example, a 2019 RAND report claimed that Russia directly intervened in Syria despite U.S. involvement in the same theater in part because U.S. involvement was restricted to certain areas and targets and was not directed at Russia's ally, the Syrian regime. As a result, Russia assessed that its intervention had a low risk of direct confrontation with the United States. 15 Although that argument applies to a situation in which Russia intervened directly, the same logic can 13 Salehyan, Gleditsch, and Cunningham, 2011, p. 715.   14 Many scholars argue that states are more likely to opt for the far lower footprint and plausibly deniable proxy option over direct intervention when directly intervening risks escalation with a rival state. But comparing proxy intervention only with direct military intervention ignores that a proxy strategy still carries a higher risk of escalation than economic or diplomatic interventions. For a sample of scholars who compare proxy strategies only with direct intervention and nonintervention, see

How economic factors play into proxy warfare receives far less attention, relative to security, domestic, and ideological considerations, but these factors can present both drivers and opportunities for states to engage in this type of warfare. 16 Mark Galeotti, "Hybrid, Ambiguous, and Non-Linear?

States may be driven to support local armed actors to pursue economic gain. Regimes may seek opportunities abroad to bolster the domestic economy writ large or economically benefit some powerful leaders or friends. Under certain conditions, sponsoring a local force, whether state or nonstate, could contribute to the state sponsor's economic interests, such as by battling actors that seek to threaten the state's economic lifelines or guaranteeing the sponsor's access to valuable local resources or an important trading bloc. 
18
States may be more likely to support local armed actors within a civil war if those actors control (or can be motivated to control) valuable territory, assets, or natural resources or have the organizational capacity to sustain economic growth in an area. 20 These economic characteristics could directly affect the perceived viability of the local partner and whether it presents a credible opportunity for support. States may also be more likely to seek economic gain through proxies when they are not exposed to any economic fallout from violence and instability in the region of the proxy war, either because that region is peripheral or because the sponsoring state has limited international economic exposure more generally.
Opportunities to engage in proxy warfare are also likely to be relatively more attractive when states are especially cost-sensitive. Analysts of proxy warfare often document how cheap supporting local actors is, especially relative to more resource-intensive military interventions. 21 States that see themselves as cash-strapped may be more likely to reach for the proxy tool when they are otherwise driven to consider an intervention.
States could be propelled to consider a proxy intervention by domestic lobbies or concerns that a conflict threatens the security or legitimacy of their regimes. Domestic political factors may also enhance the attractiveness of opportunities for proxy intervention, relative to overt or direct interventions, because of their greater deniability and lower levels of public scrutiny.
A regime's political survival can be a powerful motivator and is often built on a constellation of constituencies with their own interests and on some basis of ruling legitimacy.
First, some politically minded states are driven to intervene in foreign civil wars to appease the domestic public, powerful entities within the government, or influential lobbies outside of the government. 22 Sometimes domestic constituencies favor intervening in a particular context, spurred by ethnoreligious connections to the conflict or ideological commitments, and a regime chooses to appease those actors through proxy support. States may particularly be motivated to reach for the proxy tool if its military or intelligence arms have a long-standing capability and push for using it as 21 Mumford, 2013b; San-Akca, 2009.   22 Patrick M. Regan, "Choosing to Intervene: Outside Interventions in Internal Conflicts," Journal of 
Politics, Vol. 60, No. 3, 1998;

and Henning Tamm, "The Origins of Transnational Alliances: Rulers, Rebels, and Political Survival in the Congo Wars," International Security, Vol. 41, No. 1, 2016.
Intervention decisions could also depend on whether that decision would bolster or undermine regime security. Some regimes fear a demonstration effect. 
23
Opportunities for proxy support may be particularly attractive to states for domestic political reasons. Many scholars of military intervention have posited that war-weary populations can be a barrier to direct military interventions. 
24
26
Some states may be more intrinsically motivated to intervene because of ideological or identity-based commitments. Ideologies might include commitments to particular economic or political systems, both domestically and internationally, while identity-based commitments could include shared ethnic or religious identities. Political ideologies and kinship bonds can be strong motivators to intervene on behalf of local actors, as well as helping to identify promising opportunities for groups to support.
Political ideology is often cited as a driver of proxy wars. 28 Historical examples abound of proxy relationships that at least publicly embrace regimepromotion or normative sentiments.
Political ideologies might push states to consider promoting specific types of regimes, democratic as well as nondemocratic, in their foreign policies. 29 Commitment to a particular political system could stem from strategic, regime-preserving instincts or normative beliefs in that system's benefits. 30 Some states holding ideological commitments to their form of government could promote or preserve it by establishing their preferred political system through aligned local actors or defending it when it is challenged abroad. This view that proxy warfare is a means to actively promote a type of organizing regime was especially pronounced during the Cold War clash between communism and capitalism, but some in policy circles have also started to express fears that, with a rising China and an assertive Russia, interstate competition (and proxy wars that can be fueled by it) could divide along these lines. 31  Some states ascribe to norms of self-determination or humanitarian intervention, while others emphasize norms of sovereignty. First, some states may be driven to support local armed actors for humanitarian reasons, such as, most recently, NATO's support for local Libyan armed groups in 2011. Regarding norms of sovereignty, Chinese official documents often refer to a commitment to "non-interference" in the domestic politics of other nations, dating back to China's five principles of peaceful coexistence established in the 1950s. 32 Russian officials have also repeatedly espoused their opposition to interference into the internal politics of sovereign countries. 33  There is disagreement among China-and Russia-watchers about the degree to which these public statements reflect true normative commitments or are simply a way to insulate their own regimes from threats of externally imposed regime change. 34  A separate but important driver for supporting local actors is identity, specifically politicized ethnic or religious identity. Scholars who examine state sponsorship of nonstate armed groups especially emphasize this argument, given the finding that ethnoreligious nonstate armed groups often receive (or believe they will receive) support from diasporas or regimes that share the same affiliations. 35 This hypothesis builds on scholarship examining the role of ethnic ties in determining when states militarily intervene.
36
37
Local actors that share the same ideological proclivities or ethnic or sectarian identities as the leaders of potential sponsor states may represent more-attractive opportunities for states to support. 38

Proxy warfare is a complex phenomenon. The existing literature does not suggest any one factor, or even related group of factors, that can explain when states provide military support to combatants in another country's civil war. It does, however, provide a rich basis through which we can better understand the likely conditions that fuel proxy wars. These factors associated with proxy warfare are summarized in Table 
2
In the following chapters, we analyze the causes of proxy wars in two steps. First, drawing on the factors identified in this chapter, we conduct a statistical analysis of all cases of proxy wars from 1946 to 2010. The purpose of this analysis is to identify broad trends in the use of proxy warfare and how motivations for its use may have changed between the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the quantita- 39 Salehyan, Gleditsch, and Cunningham, 2011, p. 509; Salehyan, 2010.   40 For an exploration of these factors, see, for instance, Jason Lyall, "Are Coethnics More Effective Counterinsurgents? Evidence from the Second Chechen War," American Political Science 
Review, Vol. 104, No. 1, February 2010.
In the subsequent three chapters (Chapters 4-6), we analyze three major or regional powers' use of proxy warfare over time. The three powers, Russia, China, and Iran, represent three of the seven countries that have most frequently used this instrument of foreign policy, and they are also each of substantive value for our research questions that focus on the potential for a resurgence in proxy warfare among major or regional powers. Within each case, we assess why these countries used proxy warfare and why they stopped (in periods when they did not engage in such wars). By examining each of these countries over time, we can attempt to isolate the consequences of specific changes (such as the Islamic Revolution in Iran) even as other factors remain constant. In our concluding chapter, Chapter 7, we also compare the records of each of these powers. Comparison across cases can help to identify potential motivations for proxy warfare that are common across different types of states and which are specific to a particular type of state. Through this analysis, we attempt to understand whether these countries (and potentially others) might engage in more-aggressive use of proxy warfare in the future. This qualitative analysis, however, is restricted solely to an examination of major powers; the motivations and future behavior of less powerful states may differ from those of the countries in these case studies.
For each sponsor of proxy warfare, we also examine how long the country required to develop proxy-warfare capabilities of varying levels of sophistication. Developing and managing surrogates, especially through covert channels, is not an easy task; history is full of examples of failed proxy relationships. By examining this question, we hope to assess how long it would take a country that has not engaged in proxy warfare in its recent past (such as China) to pose a major threat through the use of surrogates.
In this chapter, we present a series of tests that explore the factors that determine state support for VNSAs. The analysis focuses on a number of themes from the literature on proxy support, including security and economic interests, domestic politics, and ideology. Across these themes, we group results into two broad categories: characteristics of the supporting state and factors that capture dynamics between the potential sponsor and other states. A third category, characteristics of the state or conflict in which the VNSA is operating, is also explored but in lesser detail, because this category has been the focus of substantial existing work, as discussed in Chapter 2. The goal of these tests is to identify historical patterns and changes over time in factors that are associated with state support for VNSAs.
The tests in this chapter engage with theories relating to geopolitical interests, economic interests, domestic politics, and ideology. Under geopolitical interests, we investigate how states choose to support proxies when their allies or rivals are experiencing civil conflict 1 and under what conditions states adopt proxies to counter the influence of their rivals abroad. 2 A variety of tests consider how states' aggregate military power factors into 1 Findley and Teo, 2006; Charap, Treyger, and Geist, 2019; Bapat, 2011; Findley, Piazza,  and Young, 2012, p. 237; Hughes, 2012; McInnis, 2016; San-Akca and Maoz, 2012; Salehyan, Gleditsch, and Cunningham, 2011, pp. 709-744; Mumford, 2013b; Schultz, 2010;  Daniel Byman, 2005, p. 37; Groh, 2019, pp. 46-52; Marshall, 2016, p. 190; Brown, 2016.   2 Brendan Sozer, "Development of Proxy Relationships: A Case Study of the

In this section, we provide an overview of the data we used to measure VNSA, or proxy, support; key factors influencing the outcomes; and a brief, nontechnical summary of the statistical model itself.
The dataset of VNSA support relationships that we utilized reflects several choices that we made that define the scope of our assessments. First, we limited the VNSAs in which we were interested to those groups that were actively engaged in an intrastate conflict with the government of the state in which they were located. We therefore excluded nonstate actors that may oppose their government but are not actively engaged in a violent conflict with it. To that end, the dataset that we compiled covers instances of significant external support to actors involved in armed conflicts between a state and a VNSA from 1946 through 2010, based on the list of such conflicts compiled by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) at the time of our research. 7  Based on this list of intrastate conflicts, we then identify the instances of significant external support to VNSAs. To compile this information, we used a number of existing datasets with information on the type, source, and dates of external support to actors in civil conflicts. After reviewing the 7 Although the UCDP dataset does list armed conflicts in more recent years, through 2018 as of this writing, the data sources covering external support are more limited temporally, which is why our quantitative analysis ends in 2011. See

and Gleditsch et al., 2002.
For the final dataset, we included all instances of proxy support in the UCDP External Support dataset. We treated the UCDP External Support dataset as authoritative in its period of coverage, 1975-2009, because it includes the most detailed information on the types of support that actors receive from their sponsors. We used ACD as the authoritative source for defining the set of conflicts and years that were included in our final dataset. We included additional observations of proxy support for 1946-2010 in two instances:

The data contain instances of support by 136 unique countries, though over 60 percent of states in the data have intervened in only one or two con-flicts. 13 There were 76 unique instances of proxy support (at the sponsorconflict level) during the Cold War years in the dataset and 112 instances after. Table 
3
This final dataset provided the outcome variables for our analyses. Different tests use slightly different specifications, but each is built on a binary outcome of a state supporting a proxy or not on a given side in a given conflict. We considered two sets of states as potential sponsors in civil conflicts: those that are nearby the conflict state and major powers. We discuss inclusion criteria in greater detail below.
We consulted a number of different sources to provide data on factors that influence external support patterns in civil conflicts and states' decision to provide such support. We present these factors here by whether they center on the conflict state, on the potential sponsor, or on dynamics between states. We briefly describe these variables as well as their sources and why their inclusion is important in the analysis.
• High-intensity conflicts: This is a binary variable, where the value is 0 while the cumulative deaths in a conflict are below 1,000, and the value is 1 in the year in which a conflict exceeds that threshold and each year thereafter. More-intense conflicts are likely to be targets for proxy support because of, for example, increased risks of contagion or other threats that a conflict may pose to neighboring or other interested parties. This variable is coded in the ACD data. • Oil rents: This is defined as a conflict state's oil rents as a share of its overall gross domestic product (GDP). These data are from the World 13 Thirty-six states are in the data as having intervened in only one conflict, and 83 states intervened in one or two conflicts, Bank. 
14
• Regime type of sponsor: We included a measure of potential sponsors' regime type using polity scores. 
17
• Balance of power between rivals: This measure captures the balance of military capabilities between states classified as rivals. In a subset of the analyses below, we examine whether the balance of capabilities between rival states influences their propensity to support opposite sides of civil conflicts in states that are proximate to both rivals, civil conflicts between rivals that are both nonmajor powers, or civil conflicts that are proximate to a major power's rival. For example, the latter category would treat the United States as a potential intervener in 21 Data are from the Correlates of War Formal Alliances Dataset (v4.1), 2014. 22 Data are from William R.

Organization, Vol. 69, No. 1, 2015.
• Potential sponsor's international economic integration: Potential sponsors that trade intensively with other states may have moreconvergent preferences over conflict management than states with few economic links. Ongoing conflicts can pose opportunity costs for these states. Integrated states may also develop common preferences over nontrade issues as a result of trade cooperation. For these reasons, integrated states may refrain from adopting proxies in conflicts, or, when they do adopt proxies, they may be more likely to do so in coordination with one another. This variable is defined as a potential sponsor's total trade with all other states nearby the conflict state as a fraction of its GDP. We used Correlates of War dyadic trade data to construct this variable. 
24
Table 
3
We accounted for oil rents as a potential economic motivator of proxy support. The other economic factors capture opportunities. Integration between potential sponsors and conflict states may facilitate proxy support on behalf of the government or raise the costs of supporting VNSAs. Economic integration among potential sponsors may have a similar influence on opportunities for support by influencing their preferences over the outcomes of regional conflicts or by shaping their ability to coordinate over their policies. Wealthier states may be less cost-sensitive and therefore may find a larger set of opportunities for proxy support.
For domestic political motivations of proxy support, the analysis accounts for different configurations of regime type among potential sponsors and conflict states. For ideological and identity motivations, the analysis accounts for postrevolutionary regimes and colonial ties. 
The tests in this chapter take the unit of analysis as the potential sponsorconflict-side-year.

The first set of results focuses on characteristics of potential state sponsors. The goal is to identify which kinds of states support VNSAs and under what conditions. Following the categories discussed above, we further break down factors by (1) characteristics of potential sponsors' regime type, 
(2)
Table

Results for potential sponsor capabilities suggest that more powerful states were most likely to support both governments and VNSAs during the Cold War. After the Cold War, state capability is significantly associated with support for governments and negatively associated with VNSA support, though there is more uncertainty around these results.
32
33
The next set of factors concerns dynamics between potential sponsors and the state experiencing civil conflict.
There is some evidence that this pattern reverses thereafter, with weaker states supporting rebel groups in stronger states, though the result is dependent upon modeling approach. 34 This post-Cold War pattern appears to be largely driven by weaker states, such as Pakistan supporting groups in India. The results with respect to government support are less certain. There is some evidence that stronger governments facing internal conflict were more likely to receive support from weaker states during the Cold War and less likely thereafter.
As might be expected, state allies were more likely to support one another both during and after the Cold War. As would also be expected, states were consistently more likely to support their rivals' internal challengers across both periods. Common examples of this latter dynamic in the dataset include Arab states supporting VNSAs challenging Israel, Pakistan sponsoring groups in India, and different African states in the Great Lakes region cultivating ties with rebel groups in neighboring rivals.

The previous section discussed characteristics of sponsors and how they help us understand which states seek out proxies in other states' civil con-Likelihood of intervention type (percentage) flicts. This section broadens the focus to dynamics between potential sponsors and their relations with other (third-party) states and other characteristics of a state's region that might make proxy support in intrastate conflicts more or less likely. States do not make proxy support decisions in a vacuum; they anticipate the reactions of other interested parties and inform their decisions based on proxy support that has already taken place. For example, it is difficult to understand trends in support for rebels in the recent civil war in Libya without accounting for the overlapping and competing interests of regional powers.
The results in this section fall under three categories: differences in capabilities between rivals and their proxy support decisions, how foreign policy differences between states influence choices to engage in balancing or bandwagoning, and how economic integration among potential sponsors influences their willingness to support governments or rebel groups.
Table

The balance of power between rivals variable displays a significant association with opposing proxy interventions during the Cold War, but this result is sensitive to how we construct the models, specifically how to account for the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Some research suggests that states closer in power levels tend to come into conflict with one another more often, but this does not appear to be the case with respect to conflict via proxies. 39 Regional hegemony ratio is associated with a greater incidence of rival support for opposing sides during the Cold War. This variable is defined as the ratio of capabilities between the first and second most capable states within the distance threshold. This measure is constructed separately for each country and each year to account for changes in neighboring state capabilities across time. Higher values of this variable indicate the presence of a nearby state with a stronger military advantage over other regional powers. For instance, during the Cold War, Cuba, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and the United States adopted proxies in El Salvador and Guatemala where the United States was a predominant regional power. Similarly, the United 39 See, for example, 
Reed, 2003, pp. 633-641
Since the end of the Cold War, competitive proxy support has become largely the province of nonmajor powers and is more likely to occur where there is greater contestation over the regional balance of power. Major power status is positively and significantly associated with competitive rival support during the Cold War, while the opposite holds in the following period. Major powers were more likely to become involved in competitive proxy support with their rivals during the Cold War and less likely thereafter. This is consistent with the nature of the intense rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War; the global nature of the competition served to motivate distant interventions by the superpowers and other major powers.
In contrast to the results for major power status, the variable for potential sponsor capabilities suggests that militarily stronger states are more likely to become involved in competitive proxy support with their rivals after the Cold War. While the strongest states frequently supported opposing sides (for example, China and the Soviet Union did so in 29 conflict-years in the dataset), there were many lesser powers that engaged in competitive proxy support during the Cold War, such as Libya and Egypt (12 such instances).
While the United States and the Soviet Union were the most prominent practitioners of competitive support, many weaker states engaged in competitive support during the Cold War.
After the Cold War, competitive support by middle powers has become more prominent. Iran and Saudi Arabia illustrate this dynamic, having supported opposite sides in 15 different conflict-years in the data. This result is also in part due to the increasing share of military capabilities held by states other than the United States and Soviet Union; recall that the military capability measures are the share of global capabilities held by a given state. While the United States has maintained a high level of global power, the collapse of the Soviet Union has, overall, led to a wider distribution of such power in the post-Cold War era.
Table

The results indicate that nonmajor power states in more-integrated regions are less likely to engage in proxy support in general in the post-Cold War period. There are no significant associations between the integration measures and proxy support for major powers in either period or for nearby powers during the Cold War. The proxy-support-reducing association for nonmajor powers after the Cold War is more significant and pronounced with respect to VNSA support. Figure

This chapter presented statistical analysis of the determinants of proxy support in civil conflicts. We compiled information on instances of proxy support from several comprehensive datasets for the years 1946 through 2010. Building on the extensive literature on external support in internal armed conflicts, we identified a number of hypotheses present in existing scholarship that had not yet been systematically tested. We grouped these hypotheses into a number of categories: conflict-state factors, potential sponsor factors, and dynamics between potential state sponsors. The geopolitical context in which states decide to adopt proxies is an important part of our analysis. In addition to the contextual factors for which we accounted, we analyzed how the determinants of state support for proxies changed during and after the Cold War.
The primary findings related to VNSA support, summarized in Table 
3
Proxy support for VNSAs may become more likely when the conflict state is more powerful than potential sponsors, though this result is largely driven by support for groups in India. Rivalry, however, is robustly associated with support for VNSAs. Pakistan's support for various groups in India suggests that rivalry is a strong motivator in spite of, or potentially because of, a power balance unfavorable to the supporting state. Postrevolutionary states are particularly prone to sponsor VNSAs.
Certain dynamics between potential sponsors are closely associated with proxy wars. A subset of our analyses addressed the conditions under which rivals intervene on opposing sides of civil wars. The analysis suggests that such proxy wars are now more likely to materialize in regions where there is not a clear hegemonic power, as is the case in the Middle East. Major powers are less likely to become involved in such wars as compared to the Cold War period. The results also suggest that civil conflicts in regions with closer economic integration are less likely to see proxy support across the board. The analysis ends in 2010, so additional research is required to account for any shifts in these patterns over the last decade. U.S. and Russian support for opposing sides in Syria or the war in Ukraine may be harbingers of a reversal of some of the trends that this chapter identifies. Starting in the 1920s, the USSR developed an initial proxy warfare capability, but it often bungled this capability in practice. Initial successes in China and Spain degenerated into debacles because of strategic missteps. After World War II and especially after the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union expanded its use of proxy warfare. During the Khrushchev era, the USSR developed the ability to support proxies on a global scale and provide them with state-of-the-art military capabilities. The emergence of independently minded Communist governments, such as the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Castro's Cuba, increasingly led the Soviet Union to support VNSAs to maintain leadership of the world Communist movement and to win such favors as permission to set up remote military bases. 1   1 Piero Gleijeses, "Moscow's Proxy?

Although the current Russian government is very different from the Bolshevik regime, there are some recurring themes in the rationales and means by which both supported proxies. In general, Moscow has employed proxies as a tool for securing and retaining geostrategic advantage. Unlike Maoist China during the 1960s, even at the height of Soviet leaders' revolutionary ardor, they hesitated to support proxies solely for reasons of ideological affinity. 4 Desperate for Western technology and capital, Moscow often limited support for Communist parties and national liberation movements abroad lest they offend foreign governments. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow's support to proxies has also evinced a preoccupation with geostrategic advantage, albeit with a heavy emphasis on ensuring Russian predominance in the former Soviet space as opposed to exporting Communist ideology.
A second recurring theme is the often reactive and ad hoc nature of the Kremlin's support to proxies. Even in the heyday of the Comintern, an international organization expressly devoted to the cultivation of proxies, other organizations often planned and implemented intervention in foreign civil wars. 5 In the USSR and post-Soviet Russia alike, various leaders and institutions have advocated incompatible positions on supporting proxies, sometimes leading to self-contradictory policies. 6 Moreover, the definition of success applied by institutions or even individuals was variable and sometimes evolved considerably over time, which challenged Moscow's ability to derive long-term strategic gains from proxy warfare.
Both the Soviet Union and the current Russian government have historically preferred to devote most of the resources they invest in proxies to national governments or aspiring governments in preference to insurgent groups or other nonstate actors. But particularly during the Soviet period, the Kremlin made modest investments in numerous nonstate proxies. While these probably received a total investment far less than that sent to state clients, numerically these "speculative investments" constituted the majority of Soviet proxies. Individuals such as Ho Chi Min and Broz Tito started out as recipients of this modest aid and rose to become national leaders themselves.
The Chinese and Yugoslav examples highlight a final theme in Moscow's experience with proxy warfare: Moscow's short-term gains from proxy successes have frequently turned into costly strategic vulnerabilities in the longer term. Soviet and Russian clients (those that have or are receiving support) should not be conflated with puppets: On more than one occasion, recipients of aid have used it to attack Moscow's interests and personnel. 7 It 5 Daniel Kowalsky, "The Soviet Union and the International Brigades, 1936-1939," Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Vol. 19, No. 4, 2006.   6 Alexei Arbatov, "Russian Security Interests and Dilemmas: An Agenda for the Future," in Alexei Arbatov, Abram Chayes, Antonia Handler Chayes, and Lara Olson, eds., Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives, Cambridge, Mass.: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1997, pp. 411-458.   7 For instance, by the Chinese Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the Somalis during the conflict over Ogaden in the 1970s.

remains to be seen whether this pattern will repeat itself with Russia's current proxy interventions.
A Brief Chronology of Soviet/Russian Use of Proxy Warfare 
Comintern Era, 1919 to Mid-1940s

Against the backdrop of the Russian civil war, representatives from 34 Communist and allied parties met in Moscow and founded the Third International (better known as the Communist International or Comintern) in March 1919. 10 The Comintern openly swore that its goal was to spread Communism to every corner of the world and bring about world revolution by whatever means necessary, legal or extralegal. With benefit of hindsight, the Communist International was a failure, at least judged by its declared goals. In some respects, this outcome is unsurprising, because, for an ostensibly conspiratorial organization, the Comintern was far too explicit about its methods and goals. The organization, equipping, and instigation of armed uprisings and civil wars counted among these activities. In a few countries, most notably China, the Comintern attained some transient successes. 11  Post-1991 archival revelations, however, show that many senior Soviet leaders regarded the Comintern with contempt and that many of them were dubious of its internationalist objectives. For reasons both ideological and otherwise, Soviet elites disliked and distrusted the Comintern, which was astonishingly ill-run even in comparison with other nascent Soviet bureaucracies and was suspected to be a hotbed of foreign spies. 12 Compared with their immediate concern over eliminating domestic enemies, fostering Communism abroad was a secondary and subsidiary goal, and one to which relatively minor resources were applied. When the time came to spread revolution, critical tasks were usually entrusted to the more competent military and civilian special services, even when the Comintern formally had the lead role.

Soviet involvement in the Spanish Civil War proved that the USSR could provide sizable and sophisticated support to actors outside its immediate region, even if the Comintern's record in that conflict was, if anything, even less flattering than that in China. Fascists and some bourgeois liberals perceived a sinister Stalinist plot to Bolshevize Iberia in the USSR's support to the Spanish Republic, but when a window of opportunity appeared to attempt a Communist takeover, the Soviet dictator let it pass-in part because of the danger of alienating Britain and France when Moscow might need them to counter fascist expansionism.

Despite catastrophic defeats at the beginning of the Nazi invasion, the outcome of World War II actualized Stalin's vision of world war as the engine of additional revolutions. Particularly after Communists consolidated their rule in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the Soviet Union now led a community of "fraternal socialist countries," which were represented by the Comintern's spiritual successor organization, the Cominform. 23 Several of these new regimes, most importantly Tito's Yugoslavia, pressured Moscow to support Communist insurrections. Skeptical because of conflicting imperatives to uphold agreements with wartime allies, Stalin bought into these demands only half-heartedly, withholding large-scale support from the Chinese Communists and only authorizing indirect support via the East 21 Antony Beevor, The Spanish Civil War, New York: Penguin Books, 2006. 22 Kotkin, 2017, p. 431. 23  European satellites for the Greek Communists. 24 Stalin alienated Tito and sowed distrust on the part of Chinese Communist leaders that would blossom into the later Sino-Soviet split. 25 But in other cases such as the 1946 Iran Crisis, Stalin cultivated local proxies to put pressure on foreign governments for desired military and economic concessions. 26 Stalin's approach to geostrategy survived into the nuclear age, but it continued to backfire in practice. Moscow supported Kim Il-sung's regime in North Korea as a proxy, but the Western reaction to the 1950 invasion of the south created the kind of confrontation with the United States that Stalin had aimed to avoid. Once again, Soviet capabilities to support proxies in material terms did not translate into unambiguous victories for the USSR's interests.
The Communists attained their greatest success in Central Europe, the 1948 seizure of power in Czechoslovakia, in part via credible threats of proxy warfare. Unlike Hungary and the rest of the future Warsaw Pact, the USSR had withdrawn its forces from Czechoslovakia before the end of 1945 as part of an agreement with the United States. As a consequence, the Communist takeover could not rely on the direct threat of Soviet military force. After a series of increasingly disappointing election results, the Czechoslovak Communist Party attempted to use its role in the country's democratically elected government to seize control over the country's security services and police apparatus. This sparked a government crisis in early 1948 that the Communists, with implicit Soviet support, leveraged into a successful coup. 27 The Czech Communists set up armed Action Committees and trade union militias that went forth to paralyze those parts of the Czechoslovak government not already under their control. President Edvard Beneš faced both the threat of a civil war with these domestic Communists and the 24 Donggil Kim, "Stalin and the Chinese Civil War," Cold War History, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2010; Albert Resis, "The Churchill-Stalin Secret 'Percentages' Agreement on the

In other cases, the USSR attempted a similar strategy of threatening other nations with the prospect of proxy war and/or invasion in the hope of receiving concessions but retreated rather than making good on these threats. The 1946 Iran Crisis provides a clear example. The Soviet Union took the opportunity afforded by its wartime occupation of Iran to cultivate two short-lived proxy states on that nation's territory, the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad and the Azerbaijan People's Government. The Red Army remained in Iran after the deadline that the Allies had agreed upon for withdrawal, and the Soviets demanded concessions while signaling the possibility of a large-scale intervention. But under diplomatic pressure from the United States, Stalin decided to back off, abandoning his local proxies in the process. Without Soviet support, the two new separatist states rapidly collapsed, and Tehran reasserted its control over their territory. 30  While the Truman administration saw Soviet influence behind every Communist insurgency, in actuality Stalin was downright stingy toward many of them, whether due to geostrategic considerations or concerns about possible ideological reliability. He withheld support from the Communists in the Greek Civil

Despite his repudiation of Stalinism in the 1956 "Secret Speech," Nikita Khrushchev retained many important aspects of his predecessor's geostrategy, most importantly its core assumption that maintaining the military security of the Soviet Union was the most important way to ensure the ultimate triumph of Communism. Like Stalin, Khrushchev believed that alliances of convenience with non-Communists could serve these ends, but he emphasized support to "wars of national liberation" pursued by VNSAs. 33  While such nation-state security partners as Nasser's Egypt and Castro's Cuba received the bulk of the resources in absolute terms, the USSR also provided modest support to a much larger number of VNSAs. 34 A risktaker compared with both Stalin and Brezhnev, Khrushchev invested in the USSR's growing force-projection capability, then used it to attempt several 32 John O.

Even in the early years of the Comintern, Soviet leaders had a complicated relationship with non-Communist radical nationalists from what would later be dubbed the "Third World." Lenin declared that imperialism was "the highest stage of capitalism," with the implication that the breakdown of colonialism in places such as India and China might prove the harbinger of world revolution. While paying some lip service to this thinking on occasion, Stalin generally allowed geopolitical maneuvering toward established great powers to take precedence over supporting national liberation movements. Khrushchev took the opposite view: He believed that supporting non-Communists in "wars of national liberation" was both good 35 Sergo Mikoyan, The Soviet Cuban Missile Crisis: Castro, Mikoyan, Kennedy, Krushchev, and the Missiles of November, Palo Alto, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2012. 36  Zubok, 2009, pp. 130-131.   37 William Taubman, Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, New York: W.W. 
Norton, 2003, pp. 354, 487.
Khrushchev's opportunistic approach to cultivating radical nationalist leaders as proxies also appeared in the 1960 Congo Crisis. Western suspicions to the contrary, Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister of the newly independent country, was not a Communist but rather a pan-Africanist who supported a neutralist position in the Cold War. When a Belgian-backed secessionist movement broke out in the resource-rich Katanga province, Lumumba appealed to the United States and United Nations for assistance, only to be rebuffed. Lacking other options, he turned to the Soviet Union, which promptly dispatched aid and advisers. This step convinced many Westerners that Lumumba was really a Soviet asset but proved inadequate to prop up his government. Lumumba's rivals arrested him, expelled the Soviet advisers, and executed him in early 1961. 39 Promising relationships with Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and Guinea's Sékou Touré lasted longer but also fizzled out after a few years. 40  Khrushchev also cultivated other institutions to build bridges with the developing world, such as People's Friendship University in Moscow. This tendency also extended to new mechanisms for cultivating and training foreign proxies to supplant those of the defunct Comintern. Study of these remains in its relative infancy, but memoir and interview accounts suggest recruits were located by regional liberation movements and sent to the USSR for military and ideological instruction. These could be characterized as minor, "speculative" investments on the part of the Soviet government. Compared with military aid to Egypt and Cuba, they probably represented minuscule amounts of resources in absolute terms but a very large fraction of the recipients' overall weapons and other supplies. 41 38 Anderson, 1963.   39 Alessandro Iandolo, "Imbalance of Power: The Soviet Union and the Congo Crisis,  1960-1961," Journal of Cold War Studies, Vol. 16, No. 2, 2014.   40 Zubok, 2009; Muehlenbeck, 2008, pp. 69-95.   41 Jocelyn Alexander, and JoAnn McGregor, "African Soldiers in the USSR: Oral Histories of ZAPU Intelligence Cadres

The final decades of Soviet power saw the apex of its power-projection capabilities and, relatedly, the high-water mark for the USSR's support to proxies. 42 In part this was because Moscow now commanded greater absolute resources and force-projection capability than in prior decades, but it also resulted from greater, more-diverse pressures to support proxy interventions. 43 In addition to the long-standing goals of improving the USSR's geostrategic position, rivalry with the PRC and pressure from Communist partner countries such as Cuba and Vietnam also impelled the Soviet Union to support proxies. 44 Moreover, decolonization presented additional opportunities for Leftist insurrections, particularly in Africa. 45 As before, however, support to nation-state proxies represented a much greater investment than that to VNSAs. Much Soviet support to the latter appears to have been driven by Cuban zeal for Third World revolutionary movements and a determination to stay at the forefront of the Communist world. 46 The ill-conceived Soviet intervention in Afghanistan proved a disastrous misstep, attracting widespread condemnation and devolving into a quagmire. 47  Soviet capability to support proxies was very extensive, yet, for reasons of either poor strategy or poor luck, this did not work out to the advantage of the USSR. The interventions in both Angola and particularly Afghanistan soured Western opinion and undermined the hard-won gains of détente.
While Leonid Brezhnev and his successors mostly refrained from forging new partnerships with non-Communists akin to Khrushchev's with the Arab Nationalists, they continued those they had inherited from him.

While it became fashionable in this era to call the Cubans "the Gurkhas of the Soviet empire," the analogy is not apt. 53 Archival documents from the former socialist countries reveal that Havana took a primary role motivating and implementing the intervention policy in Angola and in several other proxy wars in which the Kremlin would otherwise have had only a token involvement, if that. 54 As a consequence, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain exactly who was the proxy in the relationship; the tail was sometimes wagging the dog. 52 Gleijeses, 2006. 53 Senator D. Patrick Moynihan introduced this phrase in the mid-1970s. He later elaborated that "it was a brilliant move. . . . The RAND Corporation at the peak of its performance could not have invented a Third World weapons system the equal of the Cuban army" (Peter W. Rodman, More Precious Than Peace: The Cold War and the Struggle for the Third World, New York: C. Scribner's Sons, 1994, p. 157).
The scale and authenticity of Soviet support to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in their struggle against the Contras is even harder to ascertain. While there were thousands of Soviet advisers in Angola, the number in Nicaragua was tiny, possibly only a few dozen, with the foreign adviser presence almost totally dominated by the Cubans. 55 The USSR provided various kinds of military equipment, but Cubans trained the Sandinistas in how to use it. Once again, the primary impetus and direction for the intervention seems to have come from Havana rather than Moscow.

South Ossetia, and Transnistria. 57 Liberals and institutions eager for better relations with the West (such as the Foreign Ministry) fretted that supporting these breakaway movements might backfire. Involvement in these conflicts outside of Russia's borders distracted attention and resources from desperately needed internal reforms and complicated attempts to secure economic aid from Western governments. Moreover, supporting separatists in the "near abroad" set an unfavorable precedent for breakaway movements within the Russian Federation, as well as fueling chaos in neighboring states that stoked cross-border crime. But Eurasianists and the Ministry of Defense saw these breakaway movements as a vital tool for Russian security and establishing a post-Soviet regional order. 58 Supporting the separatists helped Moscow pressure Georgia to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and established the precedent that Russia would be the adjudicator of disputes between former Soviet republics. The civil war in Tajikistan, meanwhile, impelled some more conventional proxy interventions. 59 Russia intervened directly on behalf of the Tajik government, but it also supported some VNSAs, such as the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, when this seemed conducive to its interests. While the Russian military was a dim shadow of its former Soviet self, it still enjoyed vast overmatch relative to other former Soviet republics or regional VNSAs.
After the dissolution of the USSR, the Belozheva Accords established the CIS between Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The leaders of these three states initially planned on having joint armed forces, and they appointed an interim supreme military commander for the CIS. 60 But within a few 57 Marius Vahl and Michael Emerson, "Moldova and the Transnistrian Conflict," JEMIE, Vol.

By 1993, Yeltsin had a clearer vision for Russia's role in the post-Soviet regional order. Russia saw itself as the leader of the post-Soviet era, including a role as the essential and undisputed kingmaker in disputes between, and within, other former Soviet republics. The keys to this arrangement were two Russian-dominated organizations, the CIS and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). 61 Officially, Russia portrayed itself as a neutral and impartial mediator respectful of the sovereignty of all the other members. 62 The reality that Moscow controlled military forces throughout most of the former USSR gave it leverage to dictate settlements to and demand concessions from these ostensible peers, and the frozen conflicts gave Yeltsin the opportunity to establish this precedent. But Yeltsin also sweetened the deal by providing incentives such as transfers of military hardware to the newly independent governments. 63 Furthermore, disputes between different institutional constituencies about the frozen conflicts continued, even if these were less contentious than during the chaos of 1992-1993. The separatist insurgencies in which Russia intervened during 1992-1993 differed greatly from one another. In Transnistria, a separatist enclave dominated by ethnic Russians attempted to secede from newly independent Moldova, in part due to anxieties about possible unification with Romania. The Russian military blocked the Moldovan attempt to establish control over the territory and retained it base there. 64 Militarily, the Moldavians were in a hopeless position because of the presence of the Russian 14th Army, and Yeltsin was largely able to dictate the terms of the ceasefire in July 1992. This agreement established a formally neutral Joint Control Commission but also granted Russia the right to retain military forces in Transnistria. 65 While the Russian troop presence fell considerably by the end of the 1990s, this frozen conflict has remained frozen ever since.
Conditions in Georgia proved more challenging. This Caucasian nation was the only former Soviet republic outside the three Baltic republics that declined to join the CIS and CSTO. It also faced a dizzying array of internal unrest, including two separatist movements and two rival governments in Tbilisi. 66 South Ossetia broke out in revolt before the collapse of the USSR, but fighting there became much more intense in the spring of 1992. Eduard Shevardnadze, who was preoccupied with his struggle with his ousted rival Zviad Gamasakhurdia for control of Georgia, accepted a Russian-negotiated ceasefire in June 1992 that established a Joint Control Commission and an associated Joint Peacekeeping Force with Russian, South Ossetian, and Georgian participation. 67 Meanwhile, Russia still possessed several military bases in Georgia, most significantly in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. As in Transnistria, the Russians played both sides, professing neutrality while sometimes abetting or acting on behalf of the Abkhazian separatists. The conflation of the struggle over Abkhazia with the Shevardnadze- 64 Bollerup and Christensen, 1997. 65 Vahl, 2004, p. 7. 66 Hewitt, 2013.   67 International Crisis Group, "Georgia: Avoiding War in South Ossetia," Europe Report

After the color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia in 2003-2004, Vladimir Putin's Russia took a more assertive approach to governments in its "near abroad." In 2008, Russia intervened on behalf of its South Ossetian proxies, establishing the precedent that a frozen conflict could turn into a pretext for Russian intervention. 72 The conflict in Donbas that followed the Russian annexation of Crimea demonstrated an ability to cultivate clandestine proxies. The Donetsk and Luhansk separatists were suspected by many to be Russian agents, and, in any case, better-than-expected Ukrainian military performance against the separatists sparked a significant intervention by regular Russian military forces posing as volunteers. 73 The Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war demonstrated vastly improved abilities for force projection and, with them, greater capability to support proxies. This included symbolic demonstrations of support, such as hosting Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar on Russia's aircraft carrier en route to Syria, as well as supporting air campaigns in the Middle East. 74 Along with greater ability, Putin's Russia apparently sees reputational and practical advantages to its more-proactive support to proxies. Simply returning to the power-projection game advertises Moscow's resurgence as a force to be reckoned with, while proxy support can also buy goodwill that translates into political, military, or economic benefits for Russia. A phenomenon that has grown in prominence in recent years is the use of Russian PMCs. 75 While formally illegal, these groups are clearly tolerated and, in some cases, subsidized by the Russian state. Although they seem to acquit themselves badly when entrusted with difficult military tasks, mercenaries offer a number of potential advantages. First, their activities are largely self-financing, since the PMCs typically profit off of business opportunities in the countries in which they are 72 Michael Kofman, "The August War, Ten Years On: A Retrospective on the Russo-Georgian War," War on the Rocks, August 17, 2018. 73 Michael Kofman, Katya Migacheva, Brian Nichiporuk, Andrew Radin, and Jenny Oberholtzer, Lessons from Russia's Operations in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, RR-1498-A, 2017. 74

While nominally fought on behalf of the South Ossetians and Abkhazians, it is debatable whether the 2008 Russo-Georgian War should be regarded as a proxy conflict per se. Saakashvili attempted to take the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, attacking the Russian peacekeeping force there in the process. The conflict that followed was mostly, but not exclusively, an interstate war between Russia and Georgia. 76 While Russian forces displayed some embarrassing shortcomings, they still routed Saakashvili's army within a few days and made it clear that they could take Tbilisi if they wished. But the conflict was very important in its implications for Russian proxy involvement elsewhere. It established the precedent that Russia would intervene directly on behalf of its proxies if intervention appeared advantageous, even at the risk of alienating Western powers and other former Soviet states. In this context, Russian proxy engagement appeared much more ominous and politically potent than before.
The increasing opacity of Russian security decisionmaking makes it difficult to ascertain the motives for Moscow's recent proxy interventions or the criteria by which Kremlin leaders consider them successes or failures. Aggressive as their policy may appear, Russian officials seem to regard it as a proportional reaction to hostile Western powers. This was the theme of Valery Gerasimov's notorious 2013 speech characterizing what 76 Rusian Pukhov, The Tanks of August, Moscow: Centre for Analysis of

This gambit soon went seriously awry, however. The Ukrainian military proved more adept than anticipated against the irregular forces fielded by the separatists, placing the Russians in the position of either abandoning them to their fate or undertaking a substantial intervention on their behalf. Putin chose the latter, with thousands of Russian troops entering the conflict as ostensible volunteers while Moscow tried to maintain a veneer of plausi-ble deniability. 81 The shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 by a SA-11 air-to-surface missile located in rebel-held territory on July 17, 2014, further alienated foreign public opinion, foreclosing the possibility that Russia could escape international condemnation and sanctions for its involvement in eastern Ukraine. The Ukraine conflict took a dramatic turn in February 2022, when a large-scale, overt Russian invasion turned the conflict into a more traditional interstate war, albeit one in which the United States and its allies have provided extensive support to Ukraine. While this large-scale conflict is still ongoing at the time of writing (summer 2022), the analysis herein focuses exclusively on the 2014-early 2022 portion of the Donbas conflict preceding Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The ongoing civil war in Libya may prove to be a pioneering example of future Russian proxy interventions beyond the "near abroad." Unlike Syria, with which Moscow had long-standing historical investment, including a military presence, post-Qaddafi Libya is comparatively unfamiliar territory for Putin's Russia. While Russia clearly covets the opportunities afforded by this resource-rich, strategically located country, different interest groups disagree about how it should attempt to secure them. Russian support to Khalifa Haftar, Commander of the Libyan National Army, is by far the most visible. The Russian military is rumored to have provided assistance to Haftar, possibly in cooperation with the Egyptians, and the general was honored with a visit to the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov during its visit to the Mediterranean to support the intervention in Syria. But while the Russian military favors Haftar, other parts of the Russian government would prefer to work with the rival United Nations-recognized Tripoli government, and Russia has provided some support to them as well. The Russian Foreign Ministry is reported to favor a negotiated settlement between participants in the conflict, while some powerful individual Russians would prefer to side with the Tripoli government. While definite information is lacking, it is probable that these interest groups have different objectives: for instance, the Foreign Ministry likely aspires to maximize Russian diplomatic influence with Mediterranean countries such as Italy and France, while the military places greater importance on the possibility 81

Geopolitical and economic factors initially limited the Soviet pursuit of proxy warfare, largely overcoming potential ideological motivations to do so. While Lenin and other Bolsheviks hoped in the immediate aftermath of the 1917 October Revolution that their example would spark imitators in 82 Charap, Treyger, and Geist, 2019, pp. 14-15.   83 Maggie Michael, "Libyan Officials Collect Evidence of Russian Fighters in War," Associated Press, December 5, 2019.
84 Tim Lister, Sebastian Shukla, and Clarissa Ward, "Putin's Private Army," CNN, August 2018. other, more-developed countries and bring about world revolution, within a few years it became apparent that their pioneering socialist state would have to coexist with more-advanced Bourgeois powers. Moreover, the Allied intervention on behalf of the Whites in the Russian Civil War proved that Leninism's capitalist adversaries might attempt to snuff it out by military means. Lenin's successors, most importantly Joseph Stalin, concluded that ensuring the survival of the Soviet regime was the most important means for furthering the cause of Communism. Moreover, the Russian revolutionary experience convinced Stalin that "war was the mother of revolutions" and that great-power wars, which Marxist-Leninist ideology deemed inevitable, would therefore be the catalyst of the next round of revolutions. Soviet geostrategy, and the role of proxies in it, built logically atop this core assumption. 85 The USSR needed military power to deter or defeat attacks by advanced foreign militaries, but acquiring the relevant capital necessitated partnering with hostile foreign governments. At the same time, Soviet leaders had by no means abandoned the ultimate goal of world revolution; they simply acknowledged the reality that this remained a goal for the indefinite future and took what they considered pragmatic steps to work toward it.
While ideology helped frame Moscow's perceptions of threats emanating from capitalist countries and its long-term geopolitical objectives, in the shorter term Moscow frequently subordinated any desire to "export" Communist revolution to its perceived geostrategic needs. In fact, Moscow's self-appointed role as leader of the international Communist movement was often in tension with its pragmatic and sometimes imperialist geostrategy. 86  To demonstrate its support for socialist revolutions, the USSR needed to support revolutionaries, but this support often alienated Western governments that Moscow needed to avoid offending for its overall geostrategy. 87  Inconsistent Soviet behavior toward potential and actual proxies therefore made sense from the standpoint of Bolshevik leaders. While the USSR provided some support to foreign revolutionaries and other VNSAs via insti- 85 Kotkin, 2014, p. 550. 86  tutions such as the Comintern, most of its foreign support was provided to governments.
While it shares the USSR's preference to devote the bulk of investment to state proxies rather than VNSAs, post-Soviet Russia tends to use different kinds of proxies for different kinds of purposes. Without the burden of Marxist-Leninist ideology, post-1991 policy toward proxies has been both more pragmatic and more flexible. Even so, there was tension between a desire for Russia to act like "a normal country" in order to integrate into the post-Cold War international order and its geopolitical motivations to maintain its dominance over the former Soviet republics in its "near abroad."
88
Moscow's motivations have shifted over time, as has the balance that Moscow has drawn between competing priorities. Historically, however, geopolitical objectives have played the strongest role in motivating Russian and Soviet use of proxies. Ideological factors have certainly played a role as well, but normally a supporting one, nudging Moscow toward action when the geostrategic risks appear low and inflating Russian decisionmakers' perceptions of foreign threats. In contrast, economic factors, in particular the need to retain access to foreign capital and technology, have historically tended to act as restraints on Moscow's use of proxy warfare. While not the focus of this study, Russia's widespread use of PMCs and its aggression in Ukraine in 2022 may suggest a shift in Moscow's calculus about the economic consequences of proxy warfare in recent years so that economic factors have comparatively limited influence on decisions that Moscow regards as affecting vital national interests. However, such conclusions are preliminary and require further study. Meanwhile, domestic political factors historically appear to have played a relatively minor role in Russian and Soviet decisions to engage in proxy warfare (although they may have played a larger role in the actual execution of these wars). Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than in Stalin's marginalization of the organization initially established to support VNSAs, the Comintern.
Ironically, although geopolitical factors appeared to be the primary motives behind Moscow's use of proxy warfare, it is far from clear that such conflicts actually advanced Moscow's geopolitical objectives. The Soviet Union's most important short-term successes, the use of proxies to create Communist governments in China and Yugoslavia, ultimately led to setbacks as both of these countries resisted Moscow's claims to leadership within the Communist world. Similarly, while post-Soviet Russia has used proxies to short-term success in Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, its foreign adventurism has helped to diplomatically and strategically isolate Russia.
Historically, the Soviet Union and Russia have been able to develop a nominal proxy support capability in the space of a few years, with the ability to support proxies in broader regions and globally requiring years or decades more to establish. During the 1920s, Soviet assistance to the CCP helped cultivate that organization into a significant player in the country's politics. From its founding with just 50 members in mid-1921, the CCP grew in power and influence to the point that Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalists felt the need by 1927 to wage a war to destroy it. 89 Even though the Chinese Communists felt (accurately) that Moscow often did not have their best interests at heart and much of the USSR's advice to the CCP proved strategically questionable, the CCP's survival and eventual triumph in the Chinese Civil War proved that the USSR could nurture powerful VNSAs and instrumentalize them in pursuit of its perceived security interests. 90 That said, the record of Soviet support to VNSAs was marred by many failures, not just from the standpoint of those proxies but also of the Soviet patrons.
As part of its more assertive foreign policy during the decade prior to its 2022 war in Ukraine, Moscow had developed and used a proxy war capability that was able to sustain conflicts within the former Soviet Union on a substantial scale as well as project power well outside the borders of the former USSR. The Donbas conflict beginning in 2014 continued on a larger scale and for a much longer period than those conflicts in Transnistria and South Ossetia in the early 1990s. In addition to its support to Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Russian forces have begun to make their appearance in countries such as Libya. This power-projection capability had probably atrophied prior to the recapitalization of the Russian military in the early 2010s. Compared with its indifferent (if successful) performance in Georgia in 2008, the campaign in Syria proved that Russia can conduct a successful military intervention far from its borders. 91 The long-term effects of the 2022 Ukraine conflict on this capability, however, remain to be seen.
Meanwhile, the emergence of PMCs provides Moscow with a costeffective tool for supporting proxies at limited risk and cost. PMC organizations required only a few years to emerge as a usable instrument for Russian decisionmakers. First sighted in 2013, within a few years they were playing a significant role in Russia's proxy wars in Ukraine in Syria. While embarrassing incidents demonstrated the risks of entrusting risky or complicated missions to potentially unreliable PMCs, in the last few years they have been employed farther abroad in less-challenging roles, such as providing training and security in Africa.
Over the course of the past century, the Soviet Union and Russia cultivated, and then demonstrated, significant capabilities to sponsor foreign prox- 90 Kim, 2017, pp. 84-114. 91

Contemporary Russian proxy support prior to the outbreak of largescale conflict in Ukraine in 2022 demonstrated some parallels to that of the Soviet Union, but its means and methods differed considerably. The network of ideologically aligned Communist parties and related organizations that undergirded Soviet proxy interventions lacks a present-day counterpart. But post-Soviet Russia's lack of ideological commitment also provides flexibility, and Moscow has shown itself able to use proxy warfare to pursue its geopolitical interests by exploiting tools that the Soviet Union would not, such as PMCs. Russian successes in the Middle East show that Russia can be a force to be reckoned with even when it is far from its traditional sphere of influence. Yet, it remains to be seen how Russia's large-scale conflict with Ukraine beginning in 2022 will both illustrate and impact Russian capabilities in this regard over the long term.
China's Use of Proxy Warfare
The CCP began supporting communist rebel groups even before winning its own civil war, and from the 1950s through the 1980s it supported Maoist and other insurgents across the globe. While most of this activity was centered in East Asia, groups in Africa and Latin America also received training and some material support from Beijing throughout this period. The CCP was a socialist revolutionary party, and supporting other revolutionary parties was both a duty and an opportunity to push forward a movement that would, in turn, support the CCP. China's international security interests also affected the CCP's decisions regarding aid to rebels, especially after the late 1970s. By the 1990s, the CCP leadership came to believe that a world war involving China was unlikely and that the best way to secure China's future was through economic development and integration with the West, not world revolution to topple Beijing's enemies. In this chapter, we will examine the factors that drove the CCP to support insurgents, the factors that led it to stop, and the ways in which it provided such support.

In building these institutions, the PLA was able to draw on its own deep experience in guerrilla warfare. By the early 1950s, the CCP and PLA had spent far more time as a highly successful insurgent military and clandes-tine political apparatus than either had as a national military or governing party. They did not need to build expertise in toppling governments; the personnel of the CCP and PLA were already among the best-qualified people in the world to provide strategic and tactical guidance to insurgents and to determine what sorts of aid they needed. Before the establishment of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, members of foreign communist parties coming to China to learn how the CCP had been so successful were simply enrolled in existing CCP and PLA schools. 18 The Chinese military advisory group was able to be set up quickly in part because the PLA had a large pool of veteran soldiers, engineers, and officers who had the guerilla and conventional warfare skills needed by the Vietnamese. 19 At the height of Chinese involvement, thousands of Chinese personnel were present in Vietnam, primarily serving as advisers but also playing a number of direct roles, including as antiaircraft and artillery gunners, doctors, and logistics experts. 20   
Following the Korean war, China was eager for greater stability in their relations with the West to allow it to focus on building its domestic economy, at least in the short term. 21 Furthermore, publicly pushing for diplomacy over violence and respect for each nation's right to conduct its own internal affairs was seen as an effective lever to divide a belligerent Washington and its war-weary allies. 22 At the 1954 Geneva conference to end the Korean and 18 Shen and Xia, 2014, p. 206. 19  Qiang, 2000, pp. 19-20; Shen and Xia, 2014, p. 210.   20 The companion report to this one, Stephen Watts, Bryan Frederick, Nathan Chandler, Mark Toukan, Christian Curriden, Erik Mueller, Edward Geist, Ariane Tabatabai, Sara Plana, Brandon Corbin, and Jeffrey Martini, Proxy Warfare in Strategic Competition: Military Implications, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, RR-A307-3, 2023, provides a detailed description of China's role. 21 Chen Jian, "China and the Bandung Conference: Changing Perceptions and Representations," in See Seng Tan and Amitav Acharya eds., Bandung Revisited: The Legacy of the 1955 Asian-African Conference for International Order, Singapore: National University of Singapore Press, 2008, p. 134. 22 Shu Guang Zhang, "Constructing 'Peaceful Coexistence': China's Diplomacy Toward the Geneva and Bandung

During the late 1960s and 1970s, global geostrategic shifts and China's response to them had a significant impact on China's support for VNSAs around the world, and especially in Southeast Asia. This was followed by even more-profound ideological changes in the ways the CCP leadership assessed its own security and warfighting strategies in the late 1970s and 1980. As will be discussed in the next section, by the 1990s, these shifts led to an almost complete abandonment of support for foreign insurgent groups.
Moscow and Beijing had been discreetly arguing over ideological orthodoxy since the 1950s. 53 By 1963, these disagreements had broken out into the open. 54 The Soviet Union's 1968 invasion of Czechslovokia and 1969 border war with China demonstrated that, by the early 1970s, Moscow was not only an ideological opponent but also a possible existential threat to the CCP. 55 Also worrying was the fact that after finally defeating and absorbing South Vietnam, Hanoi began to aggressively pursue territorial disputes with China and grow closer to Moscow. 56 By 1979, China and Vietnam had fought a border war involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and Hanoi was threatening to turn all of Southeast Asia into a Soviet bastion to threaten China's southern border. 57 As much as Mao may have hoped to surround and choke his enemies by infiltrating and controlling the global developing nations, China's vast network of fervent revolutionaries was clearly unable to help the CCP blunt a Soviet armored assault on Beijing or defeat the Vietnamese on the battlefield, and over the course of the 1970s, the direct threats against China were increasingly unignorable. 58  The CCP's answer to these threats was a "horizontal line strategy" via which China would seek the support of the hated West in order to contain and deter the Soviet Union. 59 This led Beijing to become a strategic partner of Washington and to focus its international support more on foreign governments and well-developed insurgent groups likely to succeed (as opposed to those that were most ideologically pure) in the 1970s. 60 It should be noted that China's renewed focus on building anti-Moscow coalitions did not mean an immediate end to supporting rebels. China continued to send support to African insurgents (some of whom were also supported by Moscow) and was eager to support armed groups that fought the Russians and their Vietnamese allies, even if they espoused ideologies opposed to Maoism, such as Islamist groups in Afghanistan and Cambodian royalists.
The CCP's need for strong allies instead of fervent disciples in the 1970s often led it to build its relations with governments and cut loose the Maoist insurgent groups who wished to topple them. This was especially pronounced in Southeast Asia, where the CCP began to prioritize building an international coalition to confront Vietnam and its puppet governments in Laos and Cambodia after Hanoi became a closer ally of Moscow. 61 In 1977, Burmese leader Ne Win showed his potential usefulness to Beijing by being one of the first heads of state to visit Phnom Penh and helped confer international legitimacy on the China-allied (and anti-Vietnamese) government there. Soon after, in 1978, China recalled its "volunteer" troops fighting for the Communist Party of Burma and refused to allow the party to make 58 Mysicka, 2015, pp. 211-212; Scott, 2007, p. 69.   59 Scott, 2007, p. 69; Joseph Yu-Shek Cheng and Franklin Wankun Zhang, "Chinese  Foreign Relation Strategies Under Mao and Deng: A Systematic and Comparative  Analysis," Philippine Journal of Third World Studies, Vol. 14, No. 3, 1999.   60 Taylor, 2006, pp. 95-96; William E.

Note that China did not stop providing moral support and possibly some small, token financial support. use of Chinese territory as a base area. 62 In Thailand, China cut off almost all financial and military support for the communist insurgency in the late 1970s and early 1980s in order to strengthen relations with the Thai government and strengthen Bangkok's ability to withstand Vietnamese aggression. 63 The Thai insurgency was in large part sacrificed so that China could support another insurgent group, the Khmer Rouge, which was driven into the jungle by the 1979 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. The Cambodian insurgents could only be supported through Thailand, and so good relations with Thailand were essential if China were to enable these proxies to tie down and bleed Vietnamese forces. 64 As further evidence that, by the late 1970s, China's support for insurgents was driven more by the strategic need to confront Moscow and its allies than by a desire to support a Maoist world revolution, China began supporting noncommunist, royalist insurgents in Cambodia as well as its longtime Maoist Khmer Rouge allies. By 1982, the CCP had announced that it would no longer support communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia (presumably with the exception of the Cambodian guerrillas). 65   A Fundamental Shift in Worldview and the End of Chinese Support for VNSAs in the 1980s and 1990s
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the CCP began to undergo profound shifts in worldview that fundamentally altered how China's leaders saw the world and the ways in which China could secure its place in it. While China faced many imminent threats from Moscow and its allies in the 1970s, as the 1980s wore on and it became clear that the Soviet Union was ailing, 62  
Lintner, 1990, p. 30
Perhaps even more importantly, under Deng the CCP began to emphasize economic development over world revolution. 68 This required pragmatic policy, good relations with foreign governments, and a stable international environment, all of which reduced Beijing's will to support insurgencies. As the overall strategic imperative shifted from encouraging global classbased revolution to developing China's domestic economy, the CCP began to hoard its limited resources, to invest in its economy, and to become much less willing to spend on foreign aid to insurgent groups. While China still gave out foreign aid, this was mostly focused on governments, and the CCP began to emphasize mutual benefit, trade, and economically productive investment over unilateral aid to nonstate groups. 69 As the Cold War ended in the late 1980s and early 1990s, direct threats to China were further reduced, and China's support to VNSAs all but disappeared. The one group to which China definitely continued to give significant military hardware in the 2000s, the Burmese United Wa State Army, was in some ways the exception that proved the rule, as Chinese arms transfers seemed designed not to enable this group to overthrow the Burmese government but instead 66 Michael E.

Until the reign of Deng Xiaoping, China was driven to support communist insurgents in East Asia and across the world both by normative, ideological concerns and by traditional geopolitical or international security concerns. Normatively, the CCP saw itself as a revolutionary, internationalist socialist party with a duty to aid those trying to throw off the yokes of imperialism and capitalism. In geopolitical terms, supporting revolutionary socialist movements was a means of weakening rivals, pushing them out of important regions, and building a coalition of friendly regimes.
In general, these two factors are difficult to differentiate, because China's revolutionary ideology had a strong impact on the way it viewed its own security. Some of China's actions, such as supporting African insurgencies, seemed to be motivated largely by ideology because they had a negligible impact on China's own security. However, if we take Lin Biao's global "people's war" strategy seriously, then spreading Maoist revolution throughout developing nations was itself a geopolitical objective that would ultimately help Beijing defeat Moscow. In China's case, ideology not only provided normative drivers to liberate the oppressed peoples of the world, but it also 70 Alessandro Rippa and Martin Saxer, "Mong La: Business as Usual in the China-Myanmar Borderlands," East Asian 
History and Culture Review, No. 19, June 2016, pp. 249-250

China's support for proxies was also influenced by more-traditional geostrategic and international security concerns unrelated to ideology. In the 1950s, the CCP refused to provide significant support to Burmese Maoists for fear that they would force the Burmese government to seek Western assistance. 72 China's aid to proxies in Vietnam was far greater than that given to any other socialist party, largely because of the strategic importance to China of having a friendly regime on its southern border free of Western troops. 73 At the 1954 Geneva Conference, the CCP pressured the Vietnamese to allow the "imperialist" forces to continue to occupy the southern half of the country for the same reason: to prevent an American intervention and keep American troops far from its borders. 74  As the Soviet Union went from an ideological opponent to an existential threat in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the imperative for the CCP to build relations with states that could provide it some protection against Moscow became much stronger and ideological motivations concomitantly weaker. China began to abandon global revolutionary movements that got in the way of building strong relations with Washington and regional states wary of the Soviet Union and its partners. Beijing also prioritized supporting VNSAs who could directly weaken Soviet-allied countries (such as Vietnam), even if they rejected Maoist ideology. By 1982, China had more or less abandoned every Maoist group in Southeast Asia in order to build an anti-Vietnamese alliance with the governments that those groups sought to overthrow. The one major exception was the Khmer Rouge, which the CCP used to tie down 71 Mysicka, 2015, p. 213; Qiang, 2000, pp. 20-21.   72 
Lintner, 1990, pp. 19-20.
Qiang, 2000, p. 20.
After the end of the Cold War, China no longer faced any major international threats. 77 Maoist, revolutionary ideology was replaced with pragmatic developmentalism, emphasizing stability and economic progress over revolution at home and abroad. 78 China therefore both lacked a geopolitical incentive and possessed a strong economic disincentive to pursue widespread proxy warfare. Inasmuch as post-Deng China espoused any ideology in its international relations, it seems to have been a radical definition of state sovereignty and rejection of armed interference, though it should be noted that in the past China has frequently acted against its own ideology when there was a compelling national interest at stake. 79 Revolutionary Maoism had ceased to drive China's foreign policy, and there were few international threats Beijing faced that would justify support to VNSAs.
As demonstrated by the PLA's support to Vietnamese insurgents in the 1940s, the CCP already had most of the expertise it needed to advise and 75 Thomas, 1986, p. 20.   76 Note that China continued to provide moral and possibly very limited financial support to some Maoist groups even within states it sought to cultivate as allies, but this support was minimal, and the Communist Parties of Burma and Thailand collapsed soon after Chinese aid ceased. 77 Marti, 2001, pp. 134-135.   78 Chai, 2003, pp. 167-168; Yu, 1988, p. 857; Scott, 2007, pp. 69, 78.   79 Chengqiu Wu, "Sovereignty, Human Rights, and Responsibility: Changes in China's Response to International Humanitarian Crises," Journal of Chinese Political Science, Vol. 
15, 2010, pp. 94-95.
After the Cultural Revolution radicalized China's domestic politics in the 1960s, the Liaison Department was considered insufficiently revolutionary, its leadership was purged, and it eventually came under the management of the PLA. 81 During this time, China's aid to foreign insurgents seems to have become markedly more militarized, though it is difficult to determine how much of this was because the PLA was now more directly involved, or if it was simply a result of the more militant and radical stance taken by China as a result of the Cultural Revolution. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the CCP gave massive military aid to Communist rebels in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Thailand and built training camps in Africa to teach and supply rebels there. This sometimes involved the creation of military advisory or aid groups, which usually seemed to have been made of PLA personnel along with some political cadres from other CCP groups. 82 Most notably, the CCP built a turnkey army of thousands of Chinese citizens of Kachin or Shan descent, then used this force to conquer a swath of Burmese territory and essentially turned over both the army and the territory to the Communist Party of Burma. 83 80

For the first several decades of the PRC's existence, seemingly pragmatic security interests and ideological fervor were intertwined, both fueling Chinese support to nonstate proxy forces. As China's rivalry with the Soviet Union heated up, however, and its former proxies in Vietnam turned against Beijing, China largely abandoned this tool, often supporting governments and non-Communist forces against revolutionary movements if doing so improved its positions against the Soviet Union and Vietnam.
Given the CCP's emphasis on economic development since the late 1970s and Xi Jinping's more-recent insistence that China's rights as a great power 84 Yee, 1983, pp. 243-246.  must be respected, it seems likely that China's future decisions on whether to support VNSAs, which organizations to support, and what support to provide will be driven by international and economic factors. Furthermore, Beijing now has access to many other, less disruptive economic, political, and military tools to achieve the outcomes it desires. While the CCP is increasingly willing to proactively challenge and remold the international order, even if it were again to support VNSAs, such activities would not likely be as central to Chinese security policy or as widespread as they were during the Cold War.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has developed a military doctrine privileging hybrid warfare and gray zone operations to help tilt the regional balance of power in its favor and overcome its lack of conventional capabilities. To this end, Iran's way of war is designed to leverage asymmetric capabilities to deter, defend against, harass, contain, and combat conventionally superior adversaries. Chief among Tehran's tools is its network of nonstate allies and partners, which the Islamic Republic uses to compete with regional rivals and international adversaries. The majority of Iranian interventions into foreign conflicts since the advent of the Islamic Republic in 1979 have been proxy wars, and, with the exception of a handful of direct military interventions, Iran has largely refrained from deploying its own troops in combat beyond its borders. 1  Iran's proxy capabilities have been built over several decades, in part predating the Islamic Republic, and in three key phases. First, during the 1950s-1979 time frame, Iran, then known as the Imperial State of Iran, laid out the foundations of its proxy strategy. The efforts were more ad hoc during this period, in stark contrast with the post-1979 phases, which were marked by much more consolidated efforts to build a network. Second, starting in 1979 and until roughly 2013-2014, Iran built a comprehensive network of nonstate allies and partners throughout the Middle East and South Asia, traditionally considered as key to Iranian security. During this 1 See Ariane M.

Unfortunately, in contrast with the previous case studies, there is limited information available from open sources about internal debates within Iran over the use of proxy warfare.

In Iraq and in Lebanon, the Shah leveraged co-identity groups (whose ethnic and sectarian ties to Iran he could utilize) to promote Iranian soft power and project it abroad. Both countries were of significance for Iran by virtue of geostrategic characteristics and the presence of co-identity populations. As a neighbor with shared porous borders, Iraq was (and remains) key to Iran's own security, and the two countries share both co-sectarian ties and co-ethnic ones. Both are Shia-majority countries in a region otherwise largely dominated by Sunnis, and Kurds constitute a significant minority in both states. Lebanon may not appear as closely tied to Iran because the two nations are separated by two states (Iraq and Syria). However, historically, Lebanon has also been important for Iran. On a geostrategic level, Lebanon provided Iran with access to the Mediterranean. And, for Iran, building a proxy relationship in Lebanon was relatively easy. The presence of deep, historically rooted ties between the two nations' Shia populations (including significant exchange between their respective religious establishments and the populations) provided Tehran with an opportunity to cultivate nonstate partners there.
The Shah's intelligence organization, Sazeman-e Ettela'at va Amniyat-e Keshvar (SAVAK), was in charge of covert operations designed to cultivate and support proxies. In Afghanistan, Oman, and Yemen, Tehran supported anticommunist forces during the 1960s and 70s. Iran's proxy policy included both soft and hard power components, such as funding, influence in media and religious (particularly, Shia) circles, and attempts at installing or restoring governments friendly to Iran. 5 Nonetheless, this support was largely limited to simple material and political support, and it remains unclear whether it would have intensified had the Shah remained in power, progressing to the provision of more-advanced military capabilities to groups in the region or more broadly. What is clear, however, is that the Shah's government had a surprisingly similar justification for and narrative on the need for proxy relationships as the later, postrevolutionary 5 Arash Reisinezhad, The Shah of Iran, the Iraqi Kurds, and the Lebanese Shia, London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019, p. 134; Abbas William Samii, "The Shah's Lebanon Policy: The Role of SAVAK," Middle Eastern

When the regime began to take root in Iran and until the Iran-Iraq War, its leadership appeared largely motivated by ideology: Weakening and overthrowing ungodly regimes was an end in itself. Although experts debate the extent to which revolutionary ideology continued to play a predominant role in Iranian decisionmaking over the subsequent decades, this initial aspiration and driver of Iranian behavior clearly shaped the perceptions of Iran's neighbors, ultimately turning into a self-reinforcing dynamic. The Iran-Iraq War was partly initiated due to this very dynamic, albeit not without other historical, political, and geostrategic issues playing a significant 6 Samii, 1997, pp. 66-91.  role in motivating Saddam Hussein to invade Iran. For Saddam, whose distrust and disdain of Iranians was matched only by his distrust and disdain of Americans and the "international Jewish conspiracy," Khomeini's calls for a Shia revival were to be taken at face value. 7 Hence, he sought to check the revolutionary regime whose ideology and narrative he viewed as a key challenge to his reign, relying as he did on a Sunni powerbase in a Shiamajority country.
The Iran-Iraq War was both a driver behind and an opportunity for Iran's expansion of its proxy capabilities. As it faced its adversary on the battlefield, Iran recognized its conventional shortcomings, having just purged its military and lost its key backers and suppliers as a result of the hostage crisis and the severance of U.S.-Iran relations as the war began to break out. Hence, Tehran began to leverage other tools at its disposal, notably the militia groups loyal to Khomeini that would ultimately be united under the newly formed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). 8 During the first decade after the Revolution, the IRGC was consumed with the Iran-Iraq War in which it made its name through a more fervent version of war-of-attrition tactics: the employment of human wave attacks against Iraqi forces. 9
Offices within the IRGC, notably the Office of Liberation Movements (OLM), which was the forerunner to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF), handled unconventional warfare in which Iran was supporting proxy groups abroad. 10 Given the geopolitical stakes and overall focus on the Iran-Iraq War, this included managing ties to Kurds and Shias in Iraq. Tehran provided the Kurds and Shias with basic support, including funding and weapons. But Iran also began to play a more active role with regard to Shias in Iraq, helping organize them by empowering Iraqi Shias to create groups that would be able to resist and counter Saddam. A significant example of Iran cultivating like-minded groups among Iraqi Shia was its support to Badr, which operated as the military arm of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). Among the forms of support provided by Iran to Badr and SCIRI were sanctuary, military training, financial aid, arms, and political support. 11 In part because of that support, Badr was among the most formidable opposition groups to Saddam Hussein's rule and eventually emerged, along with SCIRI's successor political organization, as a leading player in post-2003 Iraq.
Meanwhile, the early 1980s also saw the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon, which also provided Iran with the opportunity to further assert itself in Lebanon and ultimately in Israel. Prior to these events, Iranian revolutionaries had already been traveling to Lebanon to train in guerilla warfare, allowing the revolutionaries to forge ties with Lebanese Shias. By the early to mid-1980s, Iran was once again building on the groundwork laid out by the Shah to develop proxy capabilities. In particular, it played a key role in helping form what would turn into its most successful and critical nonstate ally, Lebanese Hezbollah.
Lebanon has long been considered a significant player in Iran's foreign policy. The two nations have historically had close social, religious, and political ties. The two countries' Shia populations have a long history of exchange and intermarriage. Thus, Iran could easily cultivate ties with nonstate Shia groups in that country. There are also geopolitical reasons why Tehran built a presence in Lebanon. First, for decades (including prior to the revolution), Lebanon's geostrategic position by the Mediterranean was seen as a benefit to Iran. Second, following the revolution and Iran's fallout with Israel, Lebanon was deemed a critical theater of operation against Israel, which would enable Tehran to expand its strategic depth and deter Israel from its own backyard while also harassing it more easily.
During the Shah's reign, Iran's relationship with Israel was largely characterized by quiet cooperation. However, as the Shah wished to avoid dam-11 Ariane M. Tabatabai, Jeffrey Martini, and Becca Wasser, The Iran Threat Network (ITN): Four Models of Iran's Nonstate Client Partnerships, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, RR-4231-A, 2021.
aging relationships with Arab nations in the region and domestic observant Muslims who opposed normalization with Israel, he tried to keep this relationship as quiet as possible. The founder of the Islamic Republic and its first Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had long taken issue with the Shah's cooperation with Israel, which Khomeini deemed as an illegitimate power occupying Muslim lands. A key tenet of Khomeini's revolutionary ideology and, later, foreign policy would lie in his "struggle" against Israel. Although many of the Islamic Republic's founding ideological ideas and values may have moderated over time, the opposition to Israel would remain an integral part of the regime's outlook. 12 The initial tensions between the two countries in the wake of the revolution were reinforced over time in a classic security dilemma, in which both nations would take actions to protect themselves that the other would perceive as a threat to its own national security. Tehran would support such nonstate actors as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad to deter and harass Israel, thus fueling Jerusalem's perceptions of the Iranian threat.
After a full decade of experience managing Iran's proxy relationships, the IRGC established the IRGC-QF to oversee the portfolio in 1990. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the IRGC-QF has become "Iran's primary means for conducting unconventional operations abroad, with connections of varying degrees to state and nonstate actors globally." 13 Estimated by DIA as currently comprising 5,000 forces, the IRGC-QF is a small elite organization within the overall IRGC, which boasts nearly 200,000 personnel, excluding the largely domestic-focused Basij. It was also in the 1990s that Iran promoted the general who would become inextricably linked with the IRGC-GF's history, Qassem Soleimani, who took command of the force in 1998 and held that title until he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in early 2020. 14  The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 served as a test for Iran's proxy strategy. As mentioned previously, Iran had started to train, advise, and assist nonstate actors in Iraq under the Shah. When the Islamic Republic came to power, relationships with the Kurds and Shias continued as Iran and Iraq fought a devastating eight-year war. During that time, Iranian forces supported Iraqi Kurds and helped organize Shias in the pursuit of their common objective: defeating Saddam Hussein. When the Iran-Iraq war ended, the relationships continued with a different objective: containing Baghdad. When the United States removed the common adversary in 2003, Iran's Shia partners returned to Iraq. Some (e.g., Badr) largely adopted a governing strategy aimed at reinforcing Shia power, while others (e.g., Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kataib Hezbollah) eventually emerged and adopted a new target: the United States. Meanwhile, the Kurds largely fell in line with the United States while maintaining their ties to Iran. In the mid-to late 2000s, Iran's Shia proxies were targeting U.S. forces in Iraq to raise the cost of America's forward presence in the region. 15 Following U.S. withdrawal, Iran remained heavily engaged, seeking to maintain its influence in Iraq and prevent any developments detrimental to Iranian interests.
Later, with the rise of ISIS in 2014, Iran once again leveraged its proxy capabilities to conduct counter-ISIS operations in Iraq. The end of the territorial caliphate ushered in a renewed era of competition between the United States and Iran in Iraq, leading Tehran to use its proxies, chiefly Kataib Hezbollah, to harass and counter the United States. 16 By the time that tensions began to mount between Washington and Tehran following the May 2018 U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran's proxy capabilities were once again mostly focused on raising the cost of U.S. forward presence in Iraq and forcing it to leave the theater altogether. 17   15 Alex Horton, "Soleimani's Legacy: The Gruesome, Advanced IEDs That Haunted U.S. Troops in Iraq," Washington Post, January 3, 2020. 16 Sune Engel Rasmussen and Isabel Coles, "Iran-Backed Kataib Hezbollah Has Long Targeted U.S. Forces," Wall Street Journal, December 29, 2019. 17 Uri Friedman, "The Blueprint Iran Could Follow After Soleimani's Death," The Atlantic, January 4, 2020.
In the early days of the revolution, Iranian aid to its proxies was limited to very basic material support to countries in its immediate vicinity. Throughout the 1980s and 2000s, Iranian support gradually increased in its extent and sophistication, including the provision of extensive training, relatively advanced weaponry, intelligence, and other critical inputs to the military capabilities of its proxies. By 2013, Tehran was providing advanced support to a large number of groups in its region. The country began to increase the amount and sophistication of its support for key groups. Today, Iran occasionally provides support to far-flung VNSAs, with some examples of limited presence in Africa and Latin America, albeit mostly channeling this aid through its regional proxies such as Lebanese Hezbollah. For the most part, however, Iran focuses its proxy activities in its immediate region, providing advanced but not truly cutting-edge capabilities to proxies in the Gulf and Levant. By 2020, Tehran had roughly a dozen proxies in half a dozen theaters and countries in the region, a complex network of forces that by some estimates is composed of nearly 200,000 fighters. 18  As noted previously, the Arab Spring in general and the Syrian civil war in particular were critical to Iran's ability to grow its network of proxies and to increase its proxy capabilities. The Syrian civil war entailed some departures from Iran's typical modus operandi, but the war was instrumental in allowing the regime to refine its proxy capabilities, marking the start of the third phase of its proxy strategy. Iran deployed its own forces in combat alongside its proxies to fight in Syria. This was a shift from prior Iranian military interventions outside of the country's borders, as it had traditionally sent troops to train, advise, and assist proxies but not to engage in combat. 19 Likewise, in contrast with the past, when Iran largely focused on cultivating local forces (and, at times, complemented them with other proxies), the regime has mostly relied on foreign fighters to advance its objec- 18 Tabatabai, Martini, and Wasser, 2021; Seth Jones, "War by Proxy: Iran's Growing Footprint in the Middle East," CSIS Brief, March 2019, p. 4. 19 For a comprehensive discussion of the Iranian military intervention in Syria and its similarities and differences with previous Iranian interventions, 
see Tabatabai et al., 2021.
The Syrian civil war led to the deployment of two types of Iranianbacked proxies. First, Tehran's already established forces from the region (which it had cultivated during the first two phases of its postrevolution proxy strategy) began to arrive on the battlefield as early as 2012. 20 Iran's foremost nonstate ally, Lebanese Hezbollah, entered the war in its early stages, but the battle of al-Qusayr in April 2013 marked the first time that the group had played a significant role in leading a campaign, one that was instrumental in setting back the armed opposition. 21 The group provided a significant number of forces, reportedly seeing some 1,500 casualties by 2015 (a substantial part of the 15,000 forces, excluding reservists, that the group possessed at the time). 22 Also starting in 2012, Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militias arrived in Syria to lend support to Assad's efforts. 23 Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Kataib Hezbollah, and the Badr Organization (all Iraqi) were among the Shia militias sending foreign fighters to fight the war. 24  Second, starting in 2014, marking the beginning of the third phase of Iran's proxy strategy, newly established groups of foreign fighters began to emerge in Syria. The Afghan Shia forces known as the Fatemiyoun (first, a brigade and later elevated to a division) and their Pakistani counterparts, the Zeinabiyoun, were different from other Iranian proxies involved in Syria.

Syria has provided Iran with the grounds to test its established proxies while training its newer ones. The two categories of Iranian proxies operating in Syria have demonstrated different capabilities as the well-established, combat-experienced Hezbollah worked side by side with the newly created forces coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The latter lacked the skills, training, experience, and capabilities that their Lebanese and Iraqi counterparts have long possessed. This likely made these forces less effective on the battlefield, but it made their deployment less costly for Iran and Hezbollah, which were able to use these fighters essentially as "cannon fodder," used, for example, in riskier operations. 27 Moreover, the relative newness and lack of capabilities of these newer groups has likely made them more directly reliant on both Iran and Hezbollah for command; intelligence; training; and intelligence, financial, and equipment support.
During this phase, Iran also demonstrated an ability and the intent to provide more groups with more-sophisticated capabilities. For example, even as it was providing more-limited support to the Taliban in Afghanistan, Tehran was providing somewhat advanced capabilities to the Shia militias in Iraq and fighters in Syria and advanced systems and weapons to Lebanese Hezbollah to secure what it saw as its core interests. At the same time, Tehran was stepping up its support for the Houthis in Yemen. Iran had built a relationship with the Houthis prior to the start of the Saudi-led coalition's intervention in Yemen. As the war advanced and bogged Riyadh down, Tehran saw an opportunity to further weaken its chief regional rival amid tensions between the two countries.

Having led the IRGC-QF from 1998 to 2020, Soleimani's death prompted considerable speculation over the future course of the organization. Iran announced that Soleimani would be succeeded by his deputy, Brigadier General Esmail Qaani. Although Qaani would appear to have considerable differences in personality with Soleimani (the former generally seen as less charismatic

As we have discussed in the previous chapters, myriad motivations and opportunities can lead to the development of proxy capabilities by states and their use in proxy wars. In the case of Iran, these factors can be divided into those drivers that predated the Islamic Republic and continue to shape its worldview and those that have emerged following and, by and large, as a result of the revolution. The first category encompasses such considerations as Iran's geopolitical and ideological perceptions of itself and its surrounding region, where it often feels othered and vulnerable. The second group of drivers also include those stemming from geopolitical interests or international security, but it additionally encompasses domestic politics and ideology, the contours of which changed drastically after the revolution with the overhaul of the Iranian political system and the introduction of a revolutionary ideology.
In terms of geopolitical interests, several motivations and opportunities have shaped Iran's decisionmaking pertaining to proxies over the decades. These include Iran's rivalries with other key players in the region (such as the United States and U.S. partners in the Middle East), the lack of traditional state alliances, spillover threats posed the collapse of states in the region (such as in Afghanistan, Iraq after 2003, and Syria in recent years), and identity. A chief consideration for Iranian leaders going back centuries lies in the country's otherness in the region. Simply put, Iran is a majority non-Arab and majority non-Sunni nation-state in a region dominated by mostly Arab and Sunni states. Having been invaded and conquered a number of times over the course of centuries and having seen foreign interference in its domestic affairs, Iran has long viewed itself as a vulnerable state. The regional landscape, which had been dominated by great powers including Russia, Great Britain, France, and, later, the United States, also contributed to this threat perception. Although Iran's postrevolution conventional inferiority marks a departure from the country's immediate prerevolution era, for centuries, the nation had to contend with militarily superior powers Qaani Lead Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force?" IntelBrief, January 
23, 2020.
To overcome its disadvantages, Iran often chose to hitch its wagon to various great powers to balance against others. Immediately prior to the revolution, Iran enjoyed Western and particularly U.S. support. Afterward, however, having lost the backing of what had been its primary security partner, the United States, and being ideologically unable to turn to the rival, atheist USSR for help, the country was now left to tackle regional rivals on its own. The combination of willing and able groups, conflicts in the region, and fragile and weak governments afforded Tehran the opportunity to leverage these co-identity groups to build a network that would provide the country with a means of defending itself and advancing its interests. Nevertheless, co-identity populations in other states have also provided Iran with a tool to overcome this otherness, providing it with the means to seek to tilt the regional balance of power in its favor.
The thread running through these considerations lies in the country's lack of conventional military capabilities. Indeed, to compete with rivals, respond to potential spillover threats, make up for its lack of alliances, and ensure the regime's survival and security, Tehran requires capabilities that it does not currently possess. The scholarly literature on Iranian defense and security and military and intelligence assessments of its strategy and capabilities thoroughly document the country's conventional inferiority. 
31
It is open to debate the extent to which Iran's reliance on proxy capabilities secures it geopolitical advantage. As Iran sees it, regional states' tensions with Iran coupled with their general weakness and possible collapse are best mitigated through the use of nonstate actors. From Iran's perspective, undercutting the authority of potentially hostile regional states is a critical measure to prevent the rise of strong adversaries. Moreover, by securing ties to various nonstate actors, Tehran hopes to position itself in such a way as to prevent an unfavorable balance of power regardless of the course of events in the region. On the other hand, it can easily be argued that Iran's use of proxy warfare has helped to galvanize anti-Iranian partnerships among many of the region's major powers, thus contributing to the encirclement that Tehran had sought to avoid. Iran's actions, for instance, have helped Israel to overcome its former animosity with many of the Gulf states, replaced by tacit cooperation against Iran. 35 Given Iran's historic isolation in the region, some degree of competition or even rivalry with other regional powers was almost inevitable. Arguably, that competition now occurs at a higher level of cost and risk for Iran than it might have.
Ideological commitments may in part explain Iran's commitment to proxy warfare and the specific groups to which it has provided support, at least in the early years after the revolution and potentially through the pres-33 Mohammad Heydari, "Negahi be Moravedat-e Sepah va Artesh dar jang-e Iran va Iraq," Shahrvand, Vol. 18, October 2007. 34 Heydari, 2007.   35 Natan Sachs, "Iran's Revolution, 40 Years on: Israel's Reverse Periphery Doctrine," Brookings Institution, January 24, 2019. ent. Its ideology since 1979 has long relied on a concept of a transnational community bound by faith. The revolution was not framed as a simple transition of power in Iran. It was, rather, envisioned by Khomeini as the revival of Shias and, indeed, Muslims around the world. Initially, Khomeini played down nationalism and in its stead promoted an ideology that many populations could embrace. Iran's co-sectarians have often been sidelined in their home countries, affording Iran an opening to exploit grievances and the lack of opportunities available to those communities to present itself as an alternative protector and sponsor. But Iran's proxies are not only Shia. Several Iranian partners are Sunni and lack ethnic ties to Iran. As Muslims with shared adversaries, however, they have been among groups Tehran has cultivated, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Israel and Palestine. In fact, the Islamic Republic has carefully tailored its messaging to appeal to Shias but also to make it digestible and appealing to non-Shias, allowing it to bring them into the fold and build relationships with groups including even radical Sunnis.
As we have seen, the Iranian postrevolution proxy infrastructure was established in three key phases. First, immediately after the revolution, Iran created a new apparatus tasked with cultivating proxies and providing them with the support required to thrive. The IRGC replaced the SAVAK and took the lead in the development of Iran's proxy warfare capabilities. The main entity within the IRGC whose mandate was to support the ITN went through several iterations. Initially, Tehran established OLM, which was responsible for cultivating nonstate clients and partners throughout the region. 
36
Finally, with the start of the Syrian civil war, Iran further developed the ITN into a transnational and regional network composed not just of local forces but also of foreign fighters. In this period, Hezbollah has undertaken to advise and assist missions itself, which Iran both encourages and leverages to support other proxies.
As with the previous cases in this report, Iran's turn to proxy warfare was originally motivated by a profound sense of vulnerability. After the revolution, Iran was profoundly isolated, in both geostrategic and ethnosectarian terms, within its region. Unlike Israel, which was also isolated within the region, Iran lacked capable conventional forces to offset its lack of allies.
Tehran may also have had ideological motives for proxy warfare, a desire to "export" its revolution, especially among Shiite minorities throughout the Middle East. The ideological motive, however, should not be overstated. It is important to note that Khomeinist Iran was able to exploit ethnosectarian divisions in the Middle East so quickly in substantial part because the postrevolutionary regime built on the proxy warfare tools already developed by the government of the Shah. Moreover, Khomeinist Iran has not been ideologically consistent in its support for VNSAs, in some cases pro-38 "Sarlashkar Bagheri: Inke Gofteh Mishavad az Iran Mooshak be Yemen Haml Mishavad Dorugh Ast," Donya-ye Eqtessad, 
October 1, 2019.
Although its initial uses of proxy warfare may have been motivated by its keen sense of vulnerability, over time Iran became increasingly aggressive in its use of these instruments. This increase in Iranian subversive activity appears to have been motivated in part by the success of Lebanese Hezbollah and in part by the increase in opportunities available in the region, particularly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The central role of the IRGC in the regime may also have reinforced Tehran's appetite for proxy warfare.
Economic factors appear to have played an important role in restraining Beijing's and Moscow's appetites for supporting revolutionary movements throughout the world. These economic constraints were particularly evident during the early days of the Soviet Union, when Moscow desperately needed Western capital and technology to fuel economic growth, and in Beijing's turn to partial economic liberalization in the post-Mao period. In contrast, economic factors do not appear to have constrained Tehran.
Despite the central role of geopolitical factors in motivating Iranian use of proxy warfare, it is not clear that these instruments of competition have on balance advanced Tehran's geopolitical interests. Clearly, Iran has benefited in a number of cases from the leverage that it gains through influence over local proxies and by weakening hostile regimes. On the other hand, Tehran's increasing use of these instruments has deepened its strategic isolation, helping the Arab regimes in the region overcome their tensions with one another and with Israel to unite against Iran. these proxy warfare capabilities, they often use them much more widely than simply to address the initial vulnerability. We observed this pattern across multiple different types of states, including status quo powers, such as the United States during the Cold War, and revisionists, such as the PRC under Mao or post-1979 Iran.
In many ways, it is unsurprising that geopolitical considerations play a predominant role. As with other instruments of coercion or statecraft more generally, we would expect proxy warfare to be used strategically to improve a state's security. In other ways, however, the conclusion is less obvious. Many observers view proxy warfare as practiced by Khomeinist Iran or Maoist China as predominantly an activity motivated by ideology. As we discuss below, ideology appears to play a role. But a focus on ideological motives can cause observers to overlook the potential for proxy warfare to be used by regimes without a revolutionary ideology (such as, arguably, present-day China) or to overlook the potential for proxy relationships with seemingly strange bedfellows (a frequent occurrence, as the chapters on the Soviet Union and Iran made clear).
The geopolitical motivations for proxy warfare are not as intuitive as they first appear in another respect: the frequently self-defeating nature of these instruments. The case studies in this report are full of instances of one-time proxies turning against their former sponsors, including the PRC turning against the Soviet Union and Vietnam turning against the PRC. The use of proxy warfare also frequently provokes countervailing coalitions to fight back against the state exporting insurgency, such as the coalition of Sunni Arab states that has formed in reaction to Tehran's expanded use of proxy warfare. Finally, the economic costs can be high, as the sanction regimes against contemporary Iran and Russia suggest. Although it is beyond the scope of this report to assess the costs and benefits of proxy warfare, better understanding when states are willing to bear the potential long-term costs of proxy warfare and how other states might influence this calculus is an important topic for future research.
Given these potential drawbacks to proxy warfare, why do states engage in the practice? Doubtless, part of the answer is the high degree of uncertainty involved in such geopolitical calculations and decisionmakers' tendency to discount future costs. These calculations are likely also to be shaped by the other factors analyzed in this report. In particularly, ideo-logical commitment and economic "embeddedness" in the global economy appear to shape leaders' perceptions of their probability of success, the value to be derived if they "win" a proxy war (or the costs to be paid if the proxy war proves more disruptive than anticipated), and the range of alternatives available to decisionmakers (in particular, the potential for economic statecraft or diplomatic pressure to obtain at least partial successes at much lower levels of risk).
While difficult to separate from geopolitical considerations, ideological factors seem to have played an important role for many states in decisions to engage in proxy warfare. Consistent with previous findings, our quantitative analysis highlights that postrevolutionary regimes appear to be more likely to support VNSAs than other states. State ideology is also a crucial factor in shaping which factions most states will consider supporting, from the Iranian focus on Shia groups to the Soviet and Chinese focus on leftist or communist groups. Finally, ideology plays a role in driving the overall perception of threat from a rival that motivates much proxy war activity in the first place. The ideological divide between East and West during the Cold War was a key part of the perception on both sides that the other was an implacable adversary that needed to be combated by all available means, including proxy warfare.
We found less support for domestic politics as factors motivating states to pursue proxy warfare. We found little evidence, particularly in the case studies, that public attitudes, such as concerns for diaspora groups or particular rebel groups, were an important factor in state decisions to support VNSAs. However, we did see repeated evidence that support to VNSAs is often attractive to policymakers precisely because it avoids, or at least limits, the domestic political costs and scrutiny that would accompany the use of the country's own military forces, especially in large numbers. This desire to reduce scrutiny or domestic political opposition through the use of proxies is apparent in both autocracies and democracies. The apparent tendency of many states to expand their use of proxy warfare over time may also have its roots in domestic politics, as the bureaucratic actors responsible for such wars seek to expand their influence over time.
Similar to the previous theme, we found considerable evidence that states turn to proxy warfare to lower the economic costs of their efforts to undermine their rivals. Proxy warfare was often perceived to be cheaper, in fiscal and other terms, than direct military intervention. However, there is little evidence that the potential for economic gains (e.g., through seizing natural resources and/or the profits that derive from them) plays a large role in major powers' support for VNSAs. To the extent that such profit motives play a role, they appear to do so only at the margins and to involve small groups of domestic actors with close ties to a corrupt regime. On the other hand, while most major powers do not generally appear driven by profit motives to engage in proxy warfare, they may be constrained from using such weapons if they fear harm to trade and investment relationships. Our study did not focus on the motivations of nonmajor powers, but there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that economic gains may play a larger role in the decision to support proxies for these states (e.g., Rwandan support to groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberian support to groups in Sierra Leone in the early 2000s).
Beyond these overall themes, there are additional key points that emerged in each of the individual foregoing chapters that are important to highlight.
The limited availability of more-recent data at the time of our research constrained the types of analyses that we could perform using quantitative data on proxy wars. Nonetheless, our investigations did produce several findings. Perhaps most notable was the clear shift in state proxy war behavior between the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. During the Cold War, most instances of state support to VNSAs during civil conflicts came from more highly capable major powers. After the Cold War, this pattern shifted, and support for VNSAs came increasingly from relatively less wealthy and less capable states, such as regional powers in the Middle East and a wide variety of states in Africa.
Beyond this notable overall pattern, we also found evidence in support of geopolitical, ideological, and, to some extent, economic explanations for state decisions to provide support to VNSAs. With regards to geopolitical factors, we found that states are more likely to support VNSAs in their rivals, as well as in regions without a clear hegemon, where the balance of power may be more fluid or open to contestation. With regards to ideology, as noted above, we also found evidence that postrevolutionary regimes are more likely to support VNSAs, even after controlling for the presence of other likely correlates. We also found that higher levels of regional economic interdependence appear to dampen support for proxy warfare by all states.
Geopolitical factors also seem to have been predominant in Soviet and Russian decisions to build and employ proxy support capabilities. Concerns regarding local and regional balances of power, and a desire to identify and cultivate friendly regimes that could be potential allies in a future war with the West, were paramount in Soviet thinking in particular. That said, the effect of geopolitical factors on Soviet support for proxy warfare was not simple. It is striking, for example, that the Soviet Union adopted a restrained approach to proxy warfare for decades under Stalin, fearing that such adventures could ultimately jeopardize Soviet security by galvanizing a counterreaction by the more powerful Western states. As Soviet military capabilities matured, the Soviet Union came to use proxy warfare more aggressively-although, in some cases, it was driven as much by a desire to maintain primacy within the Communist bloc as by efforts to harm the United States and its allies and partners.
During the Soviet period, ideological factors also played an important role in informing proxy support decisionmaking and, in particular, played a large role in determining which side of a conflict the Soviets were interested in supporting. Ideological factors also greatly enhanced opportunities for providing support, with leftist groups or governments being predisposed to seek out and accept Soviet assistance. But these factors seem to have been clearly secondary to geopolitical considerations, particularly in the period under Stalin.
Economic factors appear to have been of supporting importance for the Soviet Union and for Russia. Under Stalin, these factors restrained Soviet activities in support of leftist movements because of Soviet reliance on Western capital for development. More recently, there seems to be some additional profit motive associated with many deployments of Russian PMCs that goes beyond Russian geopolitical considerations, although it is not clear that these economic opportunities are a main driver of Russian activities overall.
It is also worth noting two other characteristics of the Soviet and Russian experience with proxy warfare prior to 2022. First, most Soviet and Russian proxy support has been to governments rather than VNSAs. For many years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this preference reflected the Russian preference for stability, stemming from their own perceptions of domestic insecurity, one of the few clear instances of domestic political factors affecting Russian or Soviet decisionmaking on this issue. In morerecent years, there have been important exceptions, including support to separatists in Georgia, surrogates in eastern Ukraine in the Donbas conflict beginning in 2014, and General Hiftar's forces in Libya. Second, the Soviets, in particular, frequently had trouble controlling those receiving proxy support, some of whom turned from recipients to adversaries, including, most notably, the PRC, highlighting the risks and limitations of proxy support as a policy lever for gaining geopolitical advantage.
Chinese motivations to support proxy movements varied over time. In the early post-1949 period, Chinese decisions to support rebel groups were often ideological, as China sought to export its revolutionary Communist ideology. Even in this period, though, geopolitical considerations overlapped with ideological ones, as one of the key motivations for exporting revolution was to help create a wider range of potential allies and partners in an international system that the PRC found threatening, as well as to undermine (ideologically different) rivals. By the mid-1970s, however, geopolitical considerations had become even more paramount in Chinese decisions about becoming involved in proxy wars. China's strategic reorientation away from the USSR and toward the United States in the 1970s reflected this more pragmatic approach, and this was translated into decisions about when and where to support proxies. Support for ideologically Maoist groups fell out of favor, and support for groups that could provide clear strategic benefits, such as containing fellow-communist Vietnam in Southeast Asia, was prioritized.
Economic concerns also played a role in post-Maoist China's turn away from proxy warfare. Beijing decided that economic development was more important to its long-term security than gaining ideological allies, and for economic development, it needed trade and investment with the West and stability in developing countries with which it planned to forge economic partnerships. In the post-Cold War era, China has largely abandoned any support to rebel movements in favor of a strong strategic emphasis on state sovereignty and the maintenance of existing regimes. Domestic and economic considerations have largely driven this emphasis on support to existing governments in Chinese policy, alongside perceptions of a relatively benign international security environment throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.
Geopolitical considerations have also been instrumental in shaping the Iranian approach to proxy support. Iran's sense of strategic isolation and conventional inferiority have incentivized it to create a robust capability to support proxy forces throughout its region. By building a network of reliable partners, Iran has been able either to shift state policy toward greater consideration of Iranian interests or to weaken or distract potential adversaries.
That said, while geopolitical factors have been central to Iranian proxy support, they cannot be divorced from ideological factors. Iran's identity as a Shia Islamic power is a key reason for its strategic isolation in the region in the first place. Furthermore, these aspects of its identity have helped determine the nonstate groups with which Iran works in other countries, and it has sought to use these groups to promote revivals of Shiism and Islamism. There have been exceptions as well, when ideological and geopolitical considerations diverged, and geopolitical considerations seem to have predominated, such as in Iran's limited support and engagement with the Taliban or Hamas, both largely Sunni groups. Ideological rigidity in key parts of the Iranian leadership may also have maintained the high levels of proxy support across different geopolitical circumstances. Unlike in the Soviet and Chinese cases, for instance, there is no evidence in Iranian actions that top decisionmakers in Tehran prioritized economic development over pursuing its proxy warfare agendas, regardless of the acuity of Iranian need for such development. Also notable is the fact that early Soviet and later Cold War Communist Chinese decisionmakers responded to diplomatic isolation and perceived military vulnerability with relatively restrained use of proxy war-fare, whereas Iran responded with much more aggressive uses of this instrument. Without better information about internal policy debates in Tehran, however, the precise reasons for these patterns of behavior remain unclear.
The themes above are summarized in Table 
7
What do these past patterns tell us about the potential for a resurgence of the use of proxy warfare in a new era of great-power competition? Below we survey the evidence from this report through three lenses. First, we assess this possibility from the perspective of ongoing and historical trends in the incidence of proxy warfare. Second, we summarize the evidence for a potential resurgence in proxy wars across the four categories of factors identified in our analysis as driving proxy war involvement: geopolitical, ideological, economic, and domestic. Third and finally, we summarize the potential for greater proxy war involvement by states, including such key U.S. adversaries as China, Russia, and Iran.
Unfortunately, at the time of our research, systematic and publicly available data on the use of proxy warfare did not extend past 2010, so it is difficult to determine whether a resurgence in proxy warfare has already begun in recent years up to the time of this writing (summer 2022). 1 Certainly at an anecdotal level, there appears to have been an increase in cases, or at least their prominence. Perhaps more worryingly, we have seen a shift from the earlier post-Cold War pattern in which proxy warfare was largely a tool of weaker states (e.g., Rwanda in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo or Liberia in Sierra Leone). In recent years, we have seen a large increase in Russia's and Iran's use of proxy warfare, both quantitatively (the number of proxies that they are supporting) and qualitatively (the geographical scope of their operations and the sophistication of their use of these instruments). The big questions for analysts and policymakers going forward are 
(1)
One additional dynamic identified in our historical research underlines the risks involved if one or more powerful states begin to increase (or, potentially, already have increased) their involvement in proxy warfare. Geopolitical considerations seem to be the primary driver of uses of proxy warfare, and they often do so in ways that can be self-reinforcing. In the past, regimes 1 Unfortunately, we determined that collecting these more-recent data on a comprehensive basis such that they would be comparable to earlier available data was outside the scope of this effort.
that have made widespread use of proxy warfare have typically begun such campaigns out of an acute sense of vulnerability and a lack of other tools that are appropriate (affordable, having a sufficiently low risk of escalation, and so on). Often the use of proxy warfare expands over time, however, from instances in which it appears clearly defensive (responding to specific threats that are geographically proximate) to much more aggressive, wideranging uses of proxy warfare. Furthermore, the use of proxy warfare has historically prompted similar behavior in adversaries and rivals, creating a spiral in which one state's use of the tool increases its use by others. There are also numerous instances of spillover effects, where support for one local proxy leads to support for others in nearby countries (e.g., U.S. support for South Vietnam leading to involvement in wars in Laos and Cambodia or Iranian support to Lebanese Hezbollah drawing Iran deeply into the Syrian civil war). These factors highlight the potential risks that may accompany the apparent recent increase in proxy warfare.
As noted above, throughout this report we have identified four main types of factors that affect the motivations of states to engage in proxy warfare. Below we assess the likely future direction of each of these factors and how we assess that they are likely to alter the decisions of states to provide proxy support going forward.
With the renewed focus in many regions on strategic competition, there seems to be a growing risk that states will feel increasingly threatened by their rivals and take greater steps to counteract these threats in the years to come. Our case studies highlight how such an environment can often, though not always, lead to an increased interest in supporting proxy warfare. Once one state commits to proxy warfare, its competitors or rivals may be more likely to follow suit, increasing the risk that the phenomenon will become widespread.
There are, therefore, substantial reasons to be concerned that geopolitical factors could motivate an increased interest in proxy warfare on the part of U.S. competitors, and potentially the United States itself. Beyond the increasing bilateral intensity of competition between key rivals, the international system as a whole may be moving in a direction that makes proxy competition between rivals more feasible and attractive. During the immediate post-Cold War period, the relative unipolarity of the system went hand in hand with a reduced interest, and reduced opportunities, for other great powers, such as Russia or China, to challenge the United States through proxy warfare. As the system shifts toward greater multipolarity or, potentially, a renewed bipolar competition with China, other states may feel that they have less to risk and more to gain by challenging U.S. interests through the use of proxy warfare, given the reduced relative position of the United States in the international system.
Contrary to the anticipated trends in geopolitical factors, our assessment of ideological factors is not as grim. Neither current major U.S. competitor, China and Russia, has a particularly ideological regime, certainly not in comparison with the regimes of the same countries during the earlier Cold War period. Neither represents a globalized ideology with a ready-made set of potential partners throughout other parts of the world (and, conversely, potential local partners lack a ready-made ideology to appeal to China or Russia for assistance). Indeed, while the extent to which these differences are sincere is unclear (and there are reasons to be skeptical), the main professed ideological difference that China and Russia represent relative to the United States and its allies is a focus on state sovereignty and the continuity of existing governments, regardless of their behavior or treatment of their people. This stated ideology may or may not help increase their willingness to provide support to governments in the midst of civil conflicts, but it hardly seems likely to increase their interest in providing support to VNSAs.
Economic motivations are likely to continue to play a restraining role on the decisions of China in particular going forward, as the country continues to become increasingly integrated into the global economy and economically invested in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe through its Belt and Road Initiative. The likelihood that investments in those regions would pay off could be substantially undermined by a widespread resurgence in proxy warfare. This is not to suggest that geopolitical concerns cannot override economic concerns in particular countries or contexts, however. If efforts to prevent or limit Chinese economic penetration of a country succeeded, perhaps most likely in U.S. allies or partners, then China could well conclude that geopolitical factors would motivate close consideration of support to VNSAs in that country. Furthermore, China may be an outlier among U.S. competitors in the extent to which economic considerations may be restraining its proxy support. Russia's economy largely remains focused on natural resource extraction and, indeed, is already under a host of international sanctions due to its aggression in Ukraine (including support for proxies) and does not appear to have been inhibited in its willingness to support proxies in the former Soviet space, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Similarly, Iran has been under extensive economic sanctions for decades, with no apparent reduction in its interest or willingness to support proxies in its region.
We anticipate that domestic political factors will remain a limited factor on state decisions to support proxy warfare going forward. That said, many states, including key U.S. competitors, retain an incentive to pursue proxy support rather than overt military interventions in order to minimize domestic political costs. The most acute recent example of this phenomenon was perhaps in Ukraine, where, prior to its 2022 invasion, Russia undertook substantial media censorship and official denials to mask its involvement in the war in Eastern Ukraine. 2 But while such dynamics are likely to persist, we do not find reason to believe that they will change dramatically in the future to produce either an increase or a decrease from current levels of proxy warfare. It is possible that politically powerful actors within some competitors' state organs, such as Iran's Quds Force or the siloviki in Russia, 2 Alec Luhn, "Vladimir Putin Declares All Russian Military Deaths State Secrets," The Guardian, 
May 28, 2015
Gazette, Vol. 79, No. 4, 2017.
Given these anticipated trends across these factors, what would we expect for the likelihood that particular states will pursue proxy warfare in the years to come?
The deterioration in relations between the United States and China, the expanding strategic horizons of the PRC, and the increase in balancing behavior by other states in Asia concerned with the rise of China have the potential to increase Chinese perceptions of threats to its vital interests over the short to medium term. This could, in turn, increase Chinese motivations to support proxy warfare in countries where it feels that its interests are threatened. Based on historical examples, one would expect China to be able to reconstitute a baseline proxy warfare capability relatively quickly, should it choose to do so, probably within a couple of years of such a decision. Gaining greater proficiency, however, would likely take more time. While the early post-1949 CCP was still close to its roots as a rebel movement, the current Chinese state is vastly different and has not conducted substantial proxy warfare efforts in decades. We would therefore expect China, should it decide to pursue proxy warfare more robustly, to go through a more extensive learning process, with more-mixed results in the early stages, as has been the case with most states historically.
That said, China's widespread economic investments and continuing desire to be seen as a peacefully rising power in order to limit efforts to contain it suggest that the locations where China could find it advantageous to support VNSAs in particular are likely to be limited. Furthermore, the current Chinese regime lacks a clear ideological motivation to do so, which could otherwise have provided an accelerant to PRC proxy support. While targeted uses of Chinese proxy support could well occur in the years to come in strategically important locations, the prospect for widespread, globalized Chinese support for VNSAs on par with certain periods of the Cold War currently appears limited.
Russia is already highly motivated to support proxy warfare, albeit in different ways in different regions. Given current trends, we do not expect this to abate; however, the long-term effects of Russia's 2022 large-scale war in Ukraine on Russian motivation to support proxy warfare remain to be seen. Russia's sense of vulnerability and desire to maintain its accustomed dominance have motivated support for VNSAs in its home region, as seen in the Donbas conflict from 2014 to early 2022 and in Georgia. Russia also presents itself as an ideological competitor to the United States in other regions and as a defender of state sovereignty, which has helped to motivate (alongside geopolitical calculations) proxy support to governments, most notably in Syria. Going forward, and particularly as long as the heightened tension in relations with the West persists, there are some indications that Russia may continue to seek out opportunities to support willing proxies in ways that advance its interests and undermine those of the United States. That said, while proxy support is often affordable in comparison with direct military interventions, the costs involved can often become substantial. Furthermore, it can be difficult for states to determine in advance which proxy support relationships will evolve to become highly costly in this manner, so the more relationships a state takes on, the higher the risk it may run of escalating costs. Even before its 2022 large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was a notably resource-constrained state facing pressure on its defense budget because of unfavorable demographic and economic trends. 3 While this could change depending on future trends in the price of its fossil fuel exports, unexpected success in modernizing its economy, or the lifting of ongoing international sanctions, there are reasons to question whether Russia could sustain or increase proxy support at or above the level it is currently providing. The recent trend toward reliance on Russian PMCs may highlight how Russia might adapt to continue to provide proxy support despite these restrictions and also underlines the salience of these restrictions to begin with.
Iran's relations with the United States and its partners in the region, as of this writing, remain very poor. Iranian perceptions of threat seem likely to remain acute. Iran's ideology, regime composition, and identification as a Shia Islamic power also seem unlikely to change in the near term, continuing to fuel Iranian motivation to provide support to like-minded proxies. Efforts to increase sanctions on Iran in order to dissuade them from providing support to proxies or prompt regime change seem most likely to underline Iran's perceptions of threat from the United States and its allies, and, in general, sanctions have proven to be a limited tool for modifying state behavior or regime composition. 4 Opportunities for Iran to provide such support in active conflicts may vary, however. The regional instability following the Arab Spring substantially increased the offensive and defensive opportunities for Iranian proxy support. Some of the conflicts that stem from that period, most notably the Syrian Civil War, may be drawing to a close, and with them could come a reduction in the number or extent of Iranian support for proxy warfare (though not necessarily the end of Iranian relations with proxies established during those conflicts). Whether a future wave of conflicts in the region would provide additional opportunities for Iranian proxy intervention is uncertain, but some forecasting efforts find that the Mideast is likely to remain conflict-prone for some time. 5 It remains to be seen, as of this writing, how the January 2020 death of Qasem Soleimani could affect Iran capabilities in this area. However, the overall motivations for Iran to utilize proxy warfare as a key element of its security strategy seem likely to remain intact.
To conclude, we provide policy recommendations for the United States government, including the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, drawn from our analysis. The preceding chapters suggest that proxy warfare, although far from inevitable, has real potential to increase in frequency in the future. In recent years, Russia and Iran have increased the number, geographic scope, and sophistication of their use of proxies. Were China to become involved in this form of strategic competition, it could create an even more dangerous situation.
Our examination of the causes of proxy warfare gives reasons to hope that such wars will not become as prevalent as they were during the Cold War but also reasons for concern that they may increase over the levels observed today. On the one hand, the same ideological factors that helped to propel the Cold War either do not exist or exist in much weaker forms. China's integration into the world economy also gives Beijing a stake in the continued stability of the international order, as well as nonmilitary tools to apply leverage against states that threaten its interests. On the other hand, many of the same geopolitical factors that fueled proxy warfare in the past exist in this new era of strategic competition. Moreover, proxy warfare has a tendency to feed upon itself in positive feedback loops, leading to yet more instances of such wars. Were proxy warfare to again become a common form of strategic competition, it would likely pose serious challenges to the United States and its allies and partners, and pragmatic steps to limit this risk appear warranted. To that end, we make the following recommendations.
While this report has focused on how, when, and to what effect states engage in proxy warfare, the first lesson to emerge from our analysis is that the United States should avoid involvement in such conflicts where possible without sacrificing vital U.S. interests. These conflicts can impose considerable costs, both on the United States and on the countries involved.
That said, there may still be circumstances in which adversary proxy support threatens important U.S. interests, and a military response is war-ranted. Adversary support to VNSAs could threaten countries that are of strategic interest to the United States, whether because of their strategic position (e.g., the Philippines), the potential for spillover violence (e.g., Iraq, Syria), or possibly the location of natural resources (although our analysis does not suggest that this is generally an important trigger of proxy warfare for major powers). It is thus not hard to imagine circumstances that might prompt a U.S. response, either through an escalated level of U.S. proxy support to the affected states or through direct U.S. military intervention.
To the extent that the United States can avoid or minimize such situations, however, it should do so. Seeking to establish limits or rules of the road in strategic competitions such that leaders in competitor countries do not feel an acute sense of threat from the United States to the security of their states or regimes could mitigate what has historically been the key motivation for states to expand proxy warfare and could, in turn, reduce the likelihood that the United States will be drawn into such potentially costly conflicts. The United States also has a wide range of nonmilitary instruments, such as economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, with which it can impose lesser costs on other major powers that employ proxy warfare without the same risks of military escalation. 6   
In the event that U.S. adversaries do pursue, or continue to pursue, substantial proxy warfare activities, there are steps that the United States can take to counter them. The first of these is the need for improved intelligence to establish adversary proxy support relationships in ways that can be publicized. States often pursue proxy relationships precisely because of their greater deniability, both internationally and at home. To the extent that the U.S. government can establish the nature and extent of these relationships publicly, it can help undercut one of the key benefits that states seek in choosing proxy warfare and potentially reduce its attractiveness and 6 See, for instance, Stephan John 
Stedman, "Yugoslavia," in Richard Haass, ed., Economic Sanctions and American Diplomacy, Washington, D.C.: Council on Foreign Relations, 1998;
and Risa A. Brooks, "Sanctions and Regime Type: What Works, and When?" Security Studies, Vol. 11, No. 4, 2002.
Recognizing that the United States may not be able to avoid or deter all instances of adversary support to VNSAs in strategically important countries, the United States can also help prepare countries that are vulnerable or likely to be targeted by such support. The United States should conduct a strategic-level assessment of key U.S. allies and partners that are potentially vulnerable to proxy warfare where additional stabilization support could be provided in advance. While such an assessment is outside the scope of the present analysis, states such as the Philippines, Thailand, or Indonesia seem likely to be highlighted. The additional support provided by the United States to such countries could include economic development assistance and transportation links for subnational regions with a history or potential for separatist or other grievances. This support might entail diplomatic and political support for reconciliation efforts and political settlements with separatist groups that could become targets for adversary proxy support in the future. Or it could include resources dedicated to improving security governance in at-risk states, especially in states that show a willingness to undertake reforms. In parallel, the United States should also identify countries that could serve as safe havens or transit corridors for potential proxy groups in key U.S. allies or partners and invest in advance in their stability and relations with the United States.
Although these conflicts are already ongoing, this recommendation is also relevant to Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Freedom's Sen-tinel in Iraq and Afghanistan, respectively. While proxy support dynamics have been key aspects of these conflicts from the beginning, given the long-standing involvement of Iran in supporting Shia militias in Iraq and Pakistani support for a number of militant groups in Afghanistan, proxy involvement in these conflicts could still intensify or expand, especially as the United States further draws down its presence, as the more recent expansion of Iranian and Russian involvement in Afghanistan highlights. The United States should therefore continue to assess the risks both to mission and U.S. personnel of greater third-party involvement in these conflicts and take necessary actions to mitigate those risks as needed.
Hedging Investments in U.S. Military Capabilities to Counter Proxy Warfare Great powers have frequently discovered that the costs of proxy warfare cannot be justified by the national interests at stake. In some cases, however, the United States may determine that critical interests are threatened by foreign support for VNSAs. The United States should therefore continue to make investments in U.S. military capabilities critical to combating such threats. Indeed, by remaining prepared for such contingencies, the United States may help to deter the sorts of hostile activities that would be most likely to draw it into such an intervention.

The dataset of VNSA support relationships that we utilized reflects several choices that we made that define the scope of our assessments. First, we limited the VNSAs in which we were interested to those groups that were actively engaged in an intrastate conflict with the government of the state in which they were located. We therefore excluded nonstate actors that may oppose their government but are not actively engaged in a violent conflict with it. To that end, the dataset that we compiled covers instances of significant external support to actors involved in armed conflicts between a state and a VNSA from 1946 through 2010, based on the list of such conflicts compiled by the UCDP at the time of our research (2019-2020). 1  Based on this list of intrastate conflicts, we then needed to identify the instances of significant external support to VNSAs. To compile this information, we used a number of existing datasets with information on the type, source, and dates of external support to actors in civil conflicts. After reviewing the available data sources, the research team picked four datasets with the most comprehensive information on external support: the UCDP External Support Dataset; 2 the NAGs dataset; 3 the NSA dataset; 4 and the UCDP/PRIO ACD, version 19.1. 5  The reasoning behind using multiple datasets was twofold. First, no dataset that was available at the time of this project had coverage for the entire period of 1946 through 2018. In fact, no dataset covered 2012 through 2018 in a complete manner. 6 Second, we encountered issues in reliability or completeness for some of the information gathered by some of the datasets. Utilizing multiple datasets that overlapped in their temporal coverage therefore allowed us to check these reliability and completeness issues to help improve our compiled dataset. The manner in which we utilized each of these four datasets is discussed in detail below.
We treated the UCDP External Support dataset as authoritative in its period of coverage, 1975-2009. The dataset is organized at an annual level and includes the most detailed information on the types of support that actors 1 Although the UCDP dataset does list armed conflicts in more-recent years, through 2018 as of this writing, the data sources covering external support are more-limited temporally, which is why our quantitative analysis ends in 2011. See Oberg, Pettersson,  and Högbladh, 2019; and Gleditsch et al., 2002.   2 Högbladh, Pettersson, and Themnér, 2011.   3 San-Akca, 2016. 4 Cunningham, Gleditsch, and Salehyan, 2013, pp. 516-531.   5 Oberg, Pettersson, and Högbladh, 2019; Gleditsch et al., 2002.   6 The ACD contained some information on these years but was incomplete.
receive from their sponsors. 7 The level of detail and coding notes made this dataset a clear choice to serve as the baseline for its period of coverage. Because no dataset was likely to capture the entire universe of cases, we developed a strategy for adding data that the UCDP dataset may have missed. We identified instances of additional external support before, during, and after UCDP's coverage period by relying on the three other datasets. We discuss this strategy below after discussing the criteria for including observations from the other datasets.
The NAGs dataset covers the period stretching from 1922 through 2010 on an annual basis. We excluded all data before 1946 as the nature of the international system in this period differed substantially from the post-1945 period and was therefore less germane for our study. The NAGs data helpfully indicate the confidence level their coders had in identifying instances of external support. Their confidence is coded on a four-point scale. We kept items with the highest confidence levels of 1, which indicates that a sponsor claimed its support or the support was otherwise documented by the sponsor or another state. For the tests featured here, the NAGs data are primarily useful for fleshing out instances of proxy support before the UCDP data begin in 1975.
The NSA dataset covers the period from 1945 through 2011 and is organized at the dyad-conflict-period level. This means that instances of external support are only coded for blocks of years. For example, the NSA dataset might identify support from country X to rebel group Y in the period from 1960 to 1975 but without specifying whether this support occurred in every year in this period or just some of them. The NSA data also do not clearly or consistently identify the VNSAs involved by preserving actor or dyad numeric identifiers. In order to determine whether the rebel groups involved were in fact already present in other datasets, such as the UCDP external support 7 It also includes information on support provided to states and VNSAs from nonstate actors and populations that is not the subject of our dataset. These items were removed prior to merging the dataset into our own. data, we relied on other datasets that matched NSA and UCDP IDs, as discussed below.
We undertook a number of steps to merge the NSA data with the other data sources. First, we annualized the data according to the start and end years of the periods identified. Doing so risked overcounting the consistency of external support to VNSAs, but we assessed this risk to be preferable to the risk of ignoring relationships identified only in the NSA data altogether. Second, to merge the datasets, we leveraged the Foundations of Rebel Group Emergence (FORGE) dataset, 
8
We utilized the ACD for two purposes. First, as noted above, we used the universe of cases in the ACD to define the set of states that experienced an internal armed conflict in a given year. 9 Second, we used the ACD as an additional, though secondary, source with which to identify external support relationships. The ACD contains data on secondary warring parties that become involved in armed conflicts on behalf of either government or rebel groups. States are coded as secondary warring parties when they contribute troops to the conflict. While this is a very limited form of state support, the ACD is also the only dataset covering the entirety of 1946-2019, and so we wanted to take advantage of its coverage of periods outside of that covered by the UCDP external support data. The current version of the ACD supplied the conflict IDs to merge all datasets together. 10  The ACD only captures some state sponsors and forms of support, and it does not specify which VNSA actors actually receive support. Instead, it lists all VNSAs as belonging to one side of the conflict, whether or not these groups cooperate or are individually recipients of support. For example, in Yemen, Ansarallah, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Forces of Hadi are all listed in a single row as an opposition force in 2015, with Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates coded as supporting that entire side. Of those groups listed by UCDP as the opposition forces for 2015, clear evidence exists for state support for only the Forces of Hadi. 11 The coalition of countries was backing the Forces of Hadi when the UCDP considered it the government of Yemen, while it controlled the capital, and as a nonstate actor after Ansarallah took control. We also removed some instances where we could not find corroborating information where the ACD had coded external support.
While the most recent ACD dataset through 2019 has issues, as noted above, it is still suggestive of more recent trends in proxy warfare. The ACD identifies 94 unique conflicts between 2011 and 2019, of which 28 percent featured intervention on behalf of the government and 6 percent on the side of rebel groups. This suggests a movement toward greater support-in its most overt form-of governments over the past decade. However, these data are severely limited in their granularity. They do not, for example, code any Syrian rebels as receiving intervention at any point in the conflict even though rebel-biased interventions have played an important role in how the Syrian Civil War has unfolded. 10 The UCDP External Support, NAGs, and NSA datasets each utilized the old UCDP conflict IDs, while the UCDP External Support and NAGs datasets also utilized the old UCDP dyad and actor IDs. These ID discrepancies occurred because the UCDP revised its IDs in 2017. In order to ensure that our IDs matched the current versions, we utilized conversion datasets from the UCDP to bring the UCDP dyad and conflict IDs to the present in all three datasets. The ACD itself did not require translations as it was built using the current UCDP IDs.

We chose to cluster errors by conflict, but the central results are robust to clustering errors at both the dyad (potential sponsor-target government) and potential sponsor levels.

Greater wealth is now negatively associated with government support after the Cold War, indicating that greater wealth is a negative predictor of support of any kind in recent decades. Major power status is now positively associated with government support during the Cold War. Alliance with the conflict state is no longer (weakly) associated with support for governments after the Cold War, though it is now (weakly) associated with a lower likelihood of VNSA support.

Note that there is some latency between the peak of decolonization and Cold War tensions on the one hand and the peak of proxy wars on the other. Decolonization in many cases did not lead immediately to civil or proxy wars; rather, the process created extremely weak states that were at high risk of such wars for decades afterward. There was a rapid increase in proxy wars during the Brezhnev era of the Soviet Union. The level of proxy wars then remained high for two decades, from approximately 1980 to 2000. Many of these proxy wars did not end at the moment the Cold War ended; rather, they took years afterward to slowly unwind. Because all civil wars that received external support at some point during the war are considered proxy wars in Table1.1, these wars with their origins in the late Cold War period remain counted as proxy wars until the wars terminated-often years after the Cold War ended.
Findley and  Teo hypothesized that the likelihood that a third-party state supports a warring party increases if an ally of that third-party state is already supporting that party. They found that states are indeed more likely to intervene on the side of the government when "an ally has already intervened on the same side" but that an ally's support for the opposition was not strong enough to overcome when a third-party state's own rivalry or alliance with the local government pressured the state to support the government(Findley and Teo, 2006, pp. 831, 835)

Side refers to either the rebel group or the government. Some tests have a slightly different unit of analysis. We discuss those instances in the results section below. We also considered a sponsor-conflict-side approach that would have omitted annual observations. Such an approach would have had the benefit of weighting all sponsor-conflictside observations equally, rather than making longer conflicts more influential on the results. However, on net, we decided that incorporating annual variation would be of greater value. There is reason to think that sponsor motives often change over the course of the conflict. For example, interveners may begin as highly biased and later withdraw support, as in cases of superpower interventions toward the end of the Cold War, or may switch sides-e.g., Syria in Lebanon. Furthermore, variables at both the sponsor and regional/global levels can change significantly over the course of longer conflicts, and some interventions happen only later on in such conflicts. Using sponsorconflict-year allows us to account for that
variation.26  Note that if a state supports multiple rebel groups in a given year, proxy support is only coded once. Because the dependent variable can take three distinct values for each row in the dataset, we employed multinomial logistic regression. See Appendix A for more details on the
estimation technique.

We did not find that postrevolutionary states were more likely to engage in any type of proxy support than non-postrevolutionary states were.

SeeTables A.8  and A.9 for these results. The significance at conventional levels of ongoing conflict in contiguous states is reduced in the models with errors clustered at the dyad or supporter level instead of at the level of the conflict in question.

CHAPTER 7
Why do states engage in proxy warfare, and what do our findings suggest for likely future trends in proxy wars? In this concluding chapter, we first summarize the findings of our qualitative and quantitative analyses of sponsor motives for proxy warfare, as well as how long it has historically taken states to develop robust proxy warfare capabilities. Second, we apply these findings to the present day and assess the implications for likely future trends in proxy warfare. Finally, we conclude with a series of policy recommendations for U.S. government officials, including those in the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, regarding how the United States might prepare for and mitigate the risks of a potentially damaging future increase in proxy warfare.
Why Do States Use Proxy Warfare?
We identified several overarching themes regarding the factors that have in the past motivated states to pursue proxy warfare. First, geopolitical considerations appear to be paramount in the decision to provide support to VNSAs, across most actors and at most times. While there are exceptions, the desire to undermine rivals and shift regional balances of power is the most clearly and consistently supported factor in the preceding chapters. This desire to use proxy warfare in a proactive manner, including in regions far from a state's borders, often has its roots in a reactive concern, driven by acute perceptions of the vulnerability of the state's own security to adversary proxy warfare. However, once states have developed
This appendix provides the technical details for the quantitative analysis presented in Chapter 3. It includes information on the data sources used to construct our integrated dataset of instances of proxy warfare and precise regression output. With the renewed focus in many regions on strategic competition, there seems to be a growing risk that states will feel increasingly threatened by their rivals and take greater steps to counteract these threats in the years to come. The case studies highlight how such an environment can often, though not always, lead to an increased interest in supporting proxy warfare. Of even greater concern is the fact that geopolitical drivers of proxy warfare can often be selfreinforcing.
The states considered in the case studies were usually able to develop at least a rudimentary capability for proxy warfare very quickly, within a couple of years, often building on the capabilities of prior efforts or regimes. Beyond this baseline capability, however, a relatively lengthy period of learning and growth to better develop proxy warfare capabilities appears to be common.
