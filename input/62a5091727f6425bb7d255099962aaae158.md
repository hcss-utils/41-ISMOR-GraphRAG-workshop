It is worth noting that the Ukrainian government has owned the Antonov State Company-producer of the An-124, An-22, and other, smaller transport aircraft-since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Russia's annexation of Crimea and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine led the owned company to cut ties with Russia.
