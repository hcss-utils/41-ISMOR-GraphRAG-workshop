-Jawaharlal Nehru India's influence as a global power is increasing and this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Analysts predict that India's population will exceed China's by 2022, and studies reveal that India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased each year for the last three years, during which time China's GDP steadily decreased.
India consistently ranks as the world's largest arms importer in its quest to modernize its military and exert its influence as a regional hegemon in South Asia.
It conducts joint military exercises with the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, Australia, and many of its Asian neighbors.
India remains relatively stable despite external threats from Pakistan and China, both of which possess nuclear weapons, and internal threats from Muslim and Marxist insurgent groups.
