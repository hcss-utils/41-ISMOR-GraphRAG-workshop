Finally, we also offer our initial observations about the potential implications of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine; these observations were written in the first four weeks of the war.
For example, it is plausible that the broader, bottom-up issues discussed in this study-from the General Staff's tight grip on information and its treatment of knowledge as currency, to the military's institutional resistance to reforms, to the General Staff's highly hierarchical C2 structure and the influence of corruption on the armed services-are at least partly responsible for the Russian military's poor performance in Ukraine up to that point in time.
The improvements that allowed Russian Armed Forces to become a relatively more effective fighting force in its limited operations in Ukraine (2014) and Syria (2015) have appeared to be insufficient when attempted at scale.
Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this current conflict and the Russian military's ability to effectively wage a large-scale, highly complex operation.
