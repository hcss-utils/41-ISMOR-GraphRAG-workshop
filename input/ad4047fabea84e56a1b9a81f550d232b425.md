Looking forward to 2020, the "long-term strategic competitors" outlined in the 2018 NDS, China and Russia, each have the capability to degrade, disrupt, or deny U.S. The PLA [People's Liberation Army] considers electronic warfare (EW) an integral component of modern warfare.
Its EW strategy emphasizes suppressing, degrading, disrupting, or deceiving enemy electronic equipment.
Potential EW victims include adversary systems operating in radio, radar, microwave, infrared, and optical frequency ranges, as well as adversary computer and information systems . . .
PLA EW units routinely train to conduct jamming and anti-jamming operations against multiple communication and radar systems or GPS satellite systems in force-on-force exercises.2
