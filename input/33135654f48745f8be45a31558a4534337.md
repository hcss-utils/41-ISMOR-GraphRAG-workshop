In this final chapter, this paper evaluates changes in Russian operational art as evidenced by a comparison of Chechnya I and IT.
Russian success in major operations during Chechnya IT is a direct result oflessons learned and applied from Chechnya I, its first major post-Soviet joint campaign.
The irregular conflict environment coupled with Russia's "loss of empire" with the collapse of the Soviet Union created the perfect storm for its loss in Chechnya 1.
As history has shown, Russia, like the Red Army before it and the tsarist Army even earlier, adapted to the current threat environment to prove itself a major military power.
