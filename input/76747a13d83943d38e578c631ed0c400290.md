Russia maintains that the US-proposed European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) potentially threatens its strategic nuclear deterrent, especially in the latter phases.
Therefore, Russia wants either a change in the US plan or a Russian level of involvement and participation in designing the European ballistic missile defense (BMD) system that satisfies its nervous military leaders and politicians as to US and NATO intentions and capabilities.
Russian leaders, including then-president Medvedev, have indicated that if Russia is dissatisfied with European missile defenses, it will decline further cooperation in offensive nuclear arms reductions and possibly deploy missiles capable of launching nonstrategic nuclear weapons closer to its borders with NATO.
