In this scenario, China would be the most critical actor.
Several factors could turn China into a malignant spoiler threatening regional strategic stability.
Overt hegemonic rivalry between Beijing and Washington, an expanded Japanese role in regional defense through the new Japan-U.S. defense guidelines, and revival of a cross-strait crisis and U.S. defense of Taiwan could all drive China toward reactive spoilership.
In such an event, Korea, unified or divided, would have to take a position.
Korea's alliance with the United States and/or Japan could easily antagonize China, straining Beijing-Seoul relations.
Given the relatively long land border with China and Korean ethnic presence in China's northeastern provinces, China and Korea could become military adversaries.
Russia's Far East military build-up will not resume soon, and there might not be any immediate sources of military tension between Russia and Korea.
Thus, the Russian threat may not have to be taken into account in this scenario.
Continuing U.S. engagement in the region would mitigate any overt conflicts between Japan and Korea, but Japan could still pose a potential threat.
Two issues could complicate Japan-Korea relations.
