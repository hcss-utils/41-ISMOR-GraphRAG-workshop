After establishing the theoretical basis for the analysis, this thesis analyzed the post-Gulf War Air Force narratives and the extent to which they were effective.
In sum, "victory through airpower" was largely effective but lacked full validity and anticipation.
Had Air Force leaders adopted the rhetoric of the service to the reality of Air Force contributions, the narrative may have evolved rather than requiring radical attention. "
We are critical enablers," was also only partially effective.
It too was only valid in a particular context.
Furthermore, it did not impart cohesion because many fighter and bomber pilots rejected it out of hand.
Finally, it did not anticipate a transition back to "high end," major combat operations. "
We are critical enablers" created a curious position for Gen Welsh, who had to deal with the aftermath of drawing down from two wars while simultaneously preparing for a rising China and a resurgent Russia, as well as possible conventional wars against Iran and North Korea.
