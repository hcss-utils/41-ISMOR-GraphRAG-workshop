In the strategic landscape of post-Cold War Europe, the inclusion of ten new nations of Central and Eastern Europe in NATO is a watershed event that has critical political and security implications for the future of the alliance.
As NATO's mission and center of gravity have shifted, so must U.S. forces in Europe adapt their engagement strategy to take into account the shifting political realities on the continent.
A vital need is for the United States and its Western European allies to assist new NATO members in becoming significant partners in a military sense to match current political rhetoric that has so far been the sole justification for alliance expansion.
To this end, stationing U.S. ground brigades in Central and Eastern Europe would help bring local military forces up to NATO training and interoperability standards, stabilize still fragile democracies, provide an economic boost to nascent market economies, position U.S. forces in proximity to potential areas of instability, and provide access to excellent training areas.
In the next decade, Poland is the logical choice to accept the stationing of a U.S. brigade due to its strategic position between Germany and Russia, excellent training facilities, air and sea ports, military significance, and public support for defense.
In the longer term, Romania might be a candidate for stationing of an additional U.S. brigade, provided its defense reforms proceed apace.
Both of these nations would view a U.S. presence on their territory as a valuable symbol of solidarity, one that will reap dividends in the future as the United States seeks reliable partners for operations around the world.
