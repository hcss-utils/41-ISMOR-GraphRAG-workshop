Defining the term 'cross-cultural education' proved challenging as I conducted research and collected resource material for this paper. As I discovered, this term had a highly subjective meaning to whomever I consulted. Quite an interesting aspect of this research involved explaining to various American points of contact exactly what was meant by 'cross-cultural education'. Even more interesting was my attempt to gather information from French points of contact. I experienced cultural differences and misunderstanding first-hand!
The more involved I became in my research the more convinced I became of the benefits of a cross-cultural education for military officers. I garnered that same reaction
There is a good probability that any military operation undertaken by the United States of America will have multinational aspects, so extensive is the network of alliances, friendships, and mutual interests established by our nation around the world.

The reality of contemporary times includes more and more military members working with military personnel from other nations in alliance or coalition efforts to resolve conflicts or provide humanitarian assistance as needed. It is imperative that members of these combined forces have a positive understanding and regard for cultural differences and idiosyncrasies, not only of the peoples of the foreign nations they will be working in, but of other members with whom they will be working as peers, superiors or subordinates. Such functions as leadership, decision-making, disciplinary actions and management of stress, so embedded in the daily routine of any military member, may have contrary approaches based on cultural differences and beliefs. How well do military members from any nation comprehend these differences? Success or failure of alliance or coalition efforts may rest upon this basic premise.
In this paper, the author examines the United States Naval War College and the French Joint Defense College to determine to what extent, if any, either nation incorporates a cross-cultural emphasis into professional military education programs. The author explores the military relationship between France and the United States, describes the parallel evolution of their War Colleges, and proposes that cross-cultural studies would enhance professional military education programs.
France was chosen as the nation to compare with the United States because of the historically unique relationship between the two countries. Although the United States is a much younger country than France, both were born as democratic states just a few years apart and nurtured on fundamentally similar ideologies. Nations with such like beginnings would assume to be the strongest of allies. Yet, although democratic brethren, through two centuries they have grown up and often clashed, as rival siblings are known to do, in an effort to seek and secure the power and attention of the world. The two cultures are not stridently divergent as with the US and Russia, Japan, Libya or Peru. But neither is there the commonality of a language or of close ties as with the US and Canada, Great Britain or Australia.
This paper begins with a brief historical analysis of the military relations of France and the United States. This provides a necessary foundation for debating the benefit of a cross-cultural framework for professional military education programs. This paper cannot and does not attempt to determine whether cross-cultural education would have changed the outcome of history. However, a historical perspective may alert the reader to a comprehension of how current and future military relationships may improve when officers are educated on cultural differences and influences.
Secondly, this paper describes the evolution of the United States Naval War College and the French Joint Defense College. This scope concentrates on the Joint Professional Military Education of mid-career officers of both nations. Third, this paper compares the programs and curricula of these two specified military service colleges. Lastly, the author concludes with points of consideration for both war colleges and suggests recommendations for further research.
For purposes of this paper, cross-cultural education is defined as the instruction of cultural differences. Those differences may be obvious or subtle and vary widely linguistically, socially, professionally, politically, religiously, and even militarily. Crosscultural education will also be referred to as the preparation of individuals or groups for successful work and interaction with individuals who possess different cultural traditions, thoughts and ideals.

Romantic recall of the American Revolution portrays France as a savior nation who heroically comes to the aid of a fledgling country attempting to free itself from the tyranny of an unjust monarchy. Most Americans would agree that without the help of France during the years of the revolution, the United States would not have gained independence from Great Britain. Until that rebellion, however, the nation that was arguably the greatest threat to the American colonies, particularly along the New York and New England borders, was France. 
1
American colonies and France, being vastly different in religion, political views and institutions, cultures, and social structure, understood very little about each other. They were, however, drawn together by a common interest which allowed a viable alliance. That mutual interest was to diminish Great Britain's power.

The Americans and the French did not bask in a brotherly bond of camaraderie through the century that followed their respective Revolutions. Such conflicts as the Napoleonic Wars and the war with Prussia dominated the history of the 19th century in France as did the Civil War and western expansion in the United States. During this time, the world recognized France as one of the great powers and it actively pursued global expansion through colonialism. The United States struggled for identity and concentrated on economic and continental growth. Sea power and trade provided both nations the avenue for such national objectives. Piracy, especially in the early 1800's, was a widespread occurrence. American sea captains frequently pointed angry fingers, legitimately, toward French vessels and accused the owners of high sea robberies. Shots were often fired as an attempt at deterrence or in desperate self-preservation.
The commencement of World War I in Europe brought that continent to its knees and changed the image of war and the conduct of warfare forever. A young, isolated America saw no need nor motivation for involvement in that skirmish "over there." Immigrant America and economy-minded Americans recognized no immediate enemy with any of the European combatants. However, the United States contributed large amounts of supplies, primarily medical, to France from the start of the war. American aviators also dashed off to battle with an anxious need for involvement with the tentative beginnings of aerial warfare. 
12
Positive at the start of World War I, American and French relations remained mutually cooperative throughout the duration to victory. However, at the termination of the war, the bond disintegrated. Why? Historians claim it was the battle over peace. 
14
Trust eroded between France and the United States as they negotiated bitterly over postwar German territory, French national security, and President Wilson's grand vision for an "international forum to prevent future wars." 15 At the end of World War I the French looked upon Americans as "meddlers with little understanding of European realities" and the Americans glared at the French and questioned "what they had gained in exchange for the number of American lives lost." 
16
Charles de Gaulle, an imposing figure who would loom large during World War II and beyond concerning French and American relations, suggested that the United States' lack of involvement in the war until the end, her refusal to forge a strong partnership with
France to ensure that nation's security, and her post-war assistance to rebuild Germany contributed to Hitler's rise to power and to the domination of the Nazi regime.
Although no military conflicts have actually occurred between the two nations, there has been "a series of nagging difficulties, much mutual distrust, and…a steady drifting apart" of the governments of the United States and France since 1919. 
18
Did de Gaulle's ardent anti-American sentiment effect French foreign policy?
Undoubtedly that will be a question and a point of view that will continue to be debated by historians. However, there is no doubt that de Gaulle was a staunch nationalist totally dedicated to the resurrection of France as a "first rate" power 33 and he would flirt with any source, even some communist countries, to help him attain his goal. Yet, he wanted to remain true to NATO. What he rebelled against was what he perceived, right or wrong, as the complete control the United States had over NATO. De Gaulle wanted to ensure that France had "her own personality and controlled her own destiny." 34 De Gaulle believed that as long as the US held the reins over NATO, she would be an impediment to
France "reclaiming her rightful place at the head of the world's nations." 
35
Although de Gaulle felt that it was necessary for France to disengage from this dependence, he judged correctly that his country could not afford to do so. Yet, as the muscle of NATO grew, so did the tensions between its two most belligerent members. As Dupre suggests, "French 'grandeur' was simply incompatible with American domination of France, militarily, economically, and culturally and this conviction to resist was the seed of disagreement which intensified over 
NATO." 37
39
France had decided to revert to the full exercise of her national sovereignty by ceasing both to place forces at the disposal of integrated NATO commands and to accept the presence of foreign troops not under French commands either on French soil or in French air space. 
40
De Gaulle's legacy may actually be the creation of one of America's strongest allies.
By forcing his nation from what he perceived as the shackles of dependence on the United States, he restored his country's self-esteem and national pride. He had to prove to the world and to his own countrymen that France had the capability and the strength to act on her own authority. Although his methods have been characterized as anti-American, such actions may have been the only way for France to regain a status of independence and dignity. 41
The gradual decline of American control in Europe and of French military and economic dependence on the United States have attributed to the thawing of icy relations between the two countries in recent years.

These US planes originated from bases in Great Britain but had been denied access to
French airspace by President Mitterrand. Little did the infuriated US public realize that this was, as one author describes, "another affair in which Washington did not respect  Abroad it is the universal theory that the art of war should be studied only after an officer has arrived at full manhood and therefore most governments have established post-graduate institutions for nearly all arms of service where meritorious officers may study strategy, grand tactics and all the science of war. 7
Encouraged after meeting with General Upton, Luce perceived of such a school for the education of the professional Naval Officer. Luce had ideas for his general curriculum but allowed his staff to develop it. Also, his method of study was to be 'comparative' or the 'case method' which were radically progressive as compared to other higher learning schools of the day. Harvard Law had just introduced the 'case method' into its curriculum The second class expanded to 20 students but still remained at the level of lieutenant.
Through the next years, believers in the principles of the War College fought with skeptics both in and out of the Navy. The Naval War College continued to evolve into a justifiable institution whose products-Naval Officers indoctrinated on the conduct of war as well as doctrine and theory applicable to the operations of war-were to prove invaluable.
World War I provided the first test of the products of the War College and the graduates proved themselves well. At this time, the curriculum evolved into one that concentrated more heavily on the aspects of Command, Strategy, Tactics, and Policy.
Also, now included was the importance of Logistics as well as Joint Army-Navy
Operations in Naval Warfare. The latter topic was the first introduction to the concept of jointness in military operations…and education.
World War II tested the lessons and war games of the classroom. Admiral Chester Nimitz, in praise of the teachings of the Naval War College stated "nothing that happened during the war was a surprise...absolutely nothing except the kamikaze tactics toward the end of the war; we had not visualized these." 11 Incorporated into the curriculum after the war were insights gained from combat. Lessons were reoriented around two basic concepts: Strategy and Tactics and Strategy and Logistics. National affairs now became a topic of discussion included in the lesson plan. Such aspects as current domestic and foreign policy, international law, economics, and specific geographic regions were included.

Since its conception in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, advanced education for the French military officer has endured a cycle of highs and lows. At its highest point, the French military education program enjoyed worldwide prestige and set the standard for others to emulate. At its lowest point, some historians claim that serious weaknesses in the system led to the French military catastrophes of both World Wars. Today, the French Joint Defense College is a solidly competent organization that compares positively with equivalent advanced military education programs of other countries.
Prior to the 1800's, French military officers were primarily from the nobility and aristocracy. The French revolution "opened the officer corp to the sons of the middle class" and "many of France's best young minds entered the army." The complexities of modern warfare and the emergence of a general staff to manage large forces created a need for a professionally educated military officer. Advanced military education programs emerged. Also, significant at this time was the need to give Areas of special interest studied during the duration of this course that have the potential for expansion of cross-cultural education include:
� The national interests, objectives and strategies of the United States, its major allies, and potential adversaries. � Force planning implications of international, regional, and ad hoc coalitions supporting peace making, peace keeping, and humanitarian operations. � The security implication of international economic trends on relations among the United States, Japan, and Western Europe, and on relations between industrialized and lesser developed nations. 5
The primary focus of the third core course of the basic curriculum of the Naval War
College stresses the operational level of warfare from a joint services perspective. 
The French Joint Defense College is a one year course of study that commences every September. Officers from the Navy, the Army, the Air Force and from the French Military Security Force known as the Gendarmerie comprise the student body. Approximately one third of the 300 students who attend the yearly course are international officers from military forces throughout the world. The College concentrates heavily on the study of joint, allied and coalition operations.
The college divides the student body into four divisions. Division A, or the 'international' division includes very few French students. This division concentrates more on the French experience, French thought and French culture than do the other three divisions. International officers who speak French fluently may be included in one of the other three divisions.
At least two times during the school year, for a period of six to eight weeks each, all officers from their respective services (Army, Navy, Air Force) meet to discuss issues pertinent to that service. This allows, for instance, Navy officers from around the world to discuss and compare the service doctrine of their countries and to also discuss crosscultural issues that may effect or impact on such doctrine. During this period, the college sponsors service trips to various military bases and installations throughout France.
The curriculum of the French Joint Defense College incorporates four broad areas of study. The Operational Course concentrates on the missions and capabilities of all the military services of France as well as the missions and capabilities of foreign militaries.
Potential theaters of operation are examined and discussed. Staff officers facilitate classes on such topics as joint operations and crisis action planning. This course ends with a joint exercise wargame that involves multinational and allied forces.
The Logistics and Management course examines the responsibilities of staff officers as it relates to the movement and sustainment of troops. In addition, interaction and liaison with civilian organizations is studied during this segment. A General Education area of study embodies a variety of diverse topics. Included are geostrategic and geopolitical issues, international relations, contemporary society and defense, evolution of technology and defense, and conferences on military history and contemporary history. among all participates on the 'American way of doing things' is extremely high.
Comparisons with the American military, American politics and the American culture are constantly made. French Navy students, in particular, devour information on American Naval strategy, doctrine and operations.

Each partner in multinational operations possesses a unique cultural identity-the result of language, values, religious systems, and economic and social outlooks. Even seemingly minor differences, such as dietary restrictions, can have great impact.

The examination of the United States Naval War College and the French Joint Defense College revealed two important points from the perspective of the author of this paper. First, both schools possess the progressive potential to incorporate a formal crosscultural framework within the context of their professional military education programs.
Currently, neither school does so. The evolution of their respective curricula demonstrates an adaptability to the influences of military, political and societal changes throughout the existence of both schools.
Review of the current curriculum of the United States Naval War College shows that cultural issues are embedded in a variety of areas available for student discussion and exposure. The purpose, however, from the view of the author, is not so much to learn about the cultures of other nations, but, perhaps, to consider the impact of such strategic environment influences on American military doctrine, policy, or decision-making. The question becomes, for example, more of a "How will the French way of thinking or acting effect the American viewpoint?" rather than a "What are the positive advantages of the In conclusion, this paper focused on the Franco-American military relationship which, although volatile through two centuries, has remained one of necessity, mutual acknowledgment and continuation. For brevity this paper examined only two nations yet, the premise could be made for most nations of the world. History demonstrates that yesterday's enemies usually become tomorrow's allies. Military involvement in any future conflict will no longer be a solo endeavor. Multinational coalitions and alliances will dominate all future actions. It is imperative that members of any national military force possess a clear cultural awareness of any future partner whose actions and decisions may mean the difference between life and death.
The second event almost brought France and the United States together in a war against Iran. That nation had been harassing and pirating merchant ships in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to disrupt the worldwide commercial shipment of oil. The United States initiated Operation Earnest Will and provided naval warships as escorts to commercial ships traversing the dangerous waters. "France's naval and financial contribution to Operation Earnest Will ranked second to America's" yet was often overlooked when Congressional critics publicly complained of lack of Western European support. 48 Most recently, Operation Desert Storm demonstrated French and American military cooperation as US led coalition forces liberated Kuwait from Iraqi military occupation. 51 Approaching the new millennium, France and the United States now enjoy relatively good relations. French and American military planners continue close, if not formal, 52 coordination and cooperation. Still, current US politicians "characterize the French as 'difficult to keep on track'. Much of the problem with the American understanding of 'on track' came from France's persistence in trying to manage its own train system." 53 Notes 1 Crane Britton, The Americans and the French.

Defense College. The Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, provides Phase II JPME credit. Successful completion of Phase I and Phase II are required criteria for an officer to achieve status as a Joint Services Officer (JSO) in the US military. The National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, part of the National Defense University system, provide full JPME credit upon successful completion of their courses of study. For the Navy officer, the Naval War College is the most common option.
The War College of the United States Navy was founded on 6 October 1884 as a rather radical concept during a time in history of significant change. The General Order signed on that day stated "A college is hereby established for an advanced course of professional study for naval officers, to be known as the Naval War College." 1 That simple statement produced a profound legacy that influences Navy thought today.
Yet, in the late 19th century, the concept of professionalism was just emerging.
Advanced studies in any career field, including law and medicine, were practically nonexistent although graduate study was beginning to take shape in certain institutions of higher learning. The Naval Academy did attempt to prepare officers for long term careers but the emphasis on 'professionalism' for a military service officer was more of attitude than a product of training or education. Also, science, technology and the emerging fields of social sciences created marked changes not only in the academic thought of educational reformers but in everyday society including business and industry. The Navy was not immune to such conditions. Additional sources for cross-cultural educational opportunities are available to the military student of the Naval War College throughout the ten month academic year. Guest lecturers from diverse backgrounds address the student body on a variety of different topics. Speakers have included leading military figures as well as senior civilian officials from various government agencies, from industry and from the entertainment and media community. The International Lecture Series specifically invites "eminent international leaders to the College to explore issues of contemporary international concern." 8 An
