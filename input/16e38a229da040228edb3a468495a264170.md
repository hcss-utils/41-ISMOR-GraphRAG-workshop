The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in the re-emergence of a dormant debate within Russian society.
The two principal groups were torn between Russia either adopting Western governmental and economic practices to become a fully integrated member of the Western world, or the strengthening of Russia's Eurasian identity so that Russia could regain its dominant position with respect to Asian influence.
The Western, cosmopolitan, "Atlanticists" initially made up the reformative cabinets of Gorbachev and Yeltsin, but they were always strongly opposed by the "nationalist Eurasianists," to whom a post-Soviet doctrine included "a priority for the protection of Russians in other countries â€¦ and an appreciable redistribution of [Russian] resources, options, ties, and interests in favor of Asia, or the eastern direction."
83 Among the nationalists, there was a further division between the Russian nationalists who "advocated a new Russia that encompassed all Russians and were closely tied to Orthodox Byelorussians and Ukrainians-but no one else" and the imperial nationalists who wanted to rebuild the 82 Allison and Simes, "Russia and America: Stumbling to War."
Allison and Simes caution that Putin is "not the hardest of the hardliners" and is far more pragmatic than the "hotheads" who see overt military opportunism as the first and most proper course of action for advancing Russian power abroad.
