Prewar theory has often been developed in a sterile non-political environment in which the "pure military" aspects of doctrine were stressed.
It is impossible to separate the "pure military" aspects of warfare at the strategic and operational levels.
Whereas the "pure military" solution might be to have an offensive and aggressive military doctrine, British Vice Admiral Sir Edward Codrington learned at the Battle of Navarino (1827) that the resulting crashing defeat of the Turks so embarrassed the governments of Britain, France, and Russia that he had to be sacked and his career ruined.
Yet Codrington's doctrine and fielded technology for the battle was virtually identical to that of the victorious Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson~but the political context was not.
Codrington had learned only the lesson of Trafalgar and not Copenhagen.
