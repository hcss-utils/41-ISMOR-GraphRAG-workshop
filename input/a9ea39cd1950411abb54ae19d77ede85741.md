Taking note of the U.S. use of space-based assets in the Gulf War in 1991 and in the air campaign against Serbia in 1999, Russia observed how space-based assets could be used for conducting military operations in a future noncontact war.
Within the Russian General Staff, there was an evolution in thinking about the application of military power through space.
In the late 20th century, space was viewed as a support arm to conventional and strategic forces, providing navigation, intelligence, and timing.
Today, Russia's military leaders accept that the role of outer space is undergoing a transition from a supporting role to one of combat operations.
