The United States must add other issues to the discussions, issues that may differ depending on the counterpart.
Introducing the issue of control of shipping routes as well as other economic and military/ security instruments of national power to the discussion can help the parties reach compromises.
With Norway and Denmark, the United States could inject security and foreign military sales issues in the discussion-for example, the condition for purchase of the joint strike fighter.
In negotiations with Russia, the strategy versus Iran, cooperation in the conflict against Islamic fundamentalist groups, and NATO's missile defense system are possible issues to discuss.
With Canada, control of the Northwest Passage and trade issues may be included in negotiations.
The United States can then submit a final compromise multilaterally to the UNCLOS and CLCS.
Additionally, a securityrelated treaty similar to the Antarctic Treaty should be initiated.
