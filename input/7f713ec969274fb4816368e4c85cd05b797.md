SAC had one wing of B-52s in 1957, two years later this number had increased ten-fold.
By 1959 the command had over three hundred B-52s, all on bases in North America.
The B-52 was the first true intercontinental bomber, with a combat radius of action of 3,550 miles Without refueling this aircraft could leave the United States and reach all but a small section of southern Russia; with only one refueling, every target in the Soviet Union could be reached.
At this same time a fleet of jet aerial tankers entered the Air Force inventory, greatly aiding the SAC bomber force.
By 1959 the Air Force had over two hundred combat ready KC-135s, and unlike its predecessors, this aircraft did not require bases across the ocean.
In 1960 ten SAC bases were in Canada, and all were for tankers, to enable B-52s to reach wartime targets by traversing the North Pole region.
The long-sought polar strategy was finally realized.
