The peacekeeping operations and military exercises that Russian conducted in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and along the Russo-Georgian frontier also provided opportunities for Russia to develop the infrastructure that would ultimately support the conventional invasion.
The Russian army was able to use the bases for these operations to preposition large numbers of troops and heavy weapons on Georgian soil, and they were able to build support facilities for future operations at the same time.
The Russians build a field surgical hospital in Abkhazia that they then turned over to the Abkhazian's as a "humanitarian" gesture.
They stockpiled massive amounts of weapons and ammunition in the forward area as part of their "peacekeeping" footprint.
Most tellingly, in April and June 2008, the Russian Army repaired the railway between the Southern Military Zone and Abkhazia.
