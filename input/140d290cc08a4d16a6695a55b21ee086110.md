Russia noted that the actions decreased the division between war and peace by employing information superiority and precision military strikes to support the dynamic use of a population's protest potential and further promulgate US and allied efforts to erode the notion of state sovereignty.
The Russian assessment regarding the imminent military collapse of the Assad regime forced it to conclude its longstanding diplomatic efforts and execute military operations to protect its future regional influence, military access, and national security.
The operations exhibited characteristics of Russia's current strategy to protect interests outside of its geographic periphery by implementing mirror and asymmetric measures.
Russian actions in Syria centered on military methods supported by nonmilitary methods in the information sphere.
The operations followed the theoretical and practical elements of strategy through the planning, support, and employment of integrated measures to attain diplomatic, political, and military goals.
