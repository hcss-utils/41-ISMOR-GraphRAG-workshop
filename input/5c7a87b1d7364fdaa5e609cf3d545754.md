nation's vital interests with a minimum of risk. This solution, as the leaders of the great global powers of the past would assuredly agree, is not easy to achieve. In an ever more interdependent world in which variables for the strategist within the ends-ways-means paradigm have increased exponentially, strategists are no nearer to a "Philosopher's Stone" than they ever were. Strategy remains the most difficult of all art.
This edition of the U. S. Army War College Guide to National Security Policy and Strategy continues to reflect the structure and approach of the core national security strategy and policy curriculum at the War College. The fifth edition is published in two volumes that correspond roughly to the Department of National Security and Strategy's core courses: "Theory of War and Strategy" and "National Security Policy and Strategy." Like previous editions, this one is based on its predecessor but contains both updates and new scholarship. Over a third of the chapters are new or have undergone significant rewrites. Many chapters, some of which appeared for years in this work, have been removed. Nevertheless, the book remains unchanged in intent and purpose. Although this is not primarily a textbook, it does reflect both the method and manner we use to teach strategy formulation to America's future senior leaders.
The book is not a comprehensive or exhaustive treatment of either strategic theory or the policymaking process. Both volumes are organized to proceed from the general to the specific. Thus, the first volume opens with general thoughts on the nature and theory of war and strategy, proceeds to look at the complex aspect of power, and concludes with specific theoretical issues. Similarly, the second volume begins by examining the policy/strategy process, moves to a look at the strategic environment, and concludes with some specific issues. This edition continues the effort begun in the fourth edition to include several short case studies to illustrate the primary material in the volume.
WHY IS STRATEGY DIFFICULT?
Colonel (Ret.) Arthur Lykke has taught an entire generation of U.S. Army War College students that strategy at any level consists of ends or objectives, ways or concepts, and means or resources. This three-element framework is nothing more than a reworking of the traditional definition of strategy as the calculated relationship of ends and means. Yet, the student response is always overwhelmingly favorable, with Lykke's framework invariably forming the structure for subsequent seminar problems on subjects ranging from the U.S. Civil War to nuclear strategy. This is due, in part, to the fact that students weaned on the structural certitude of the five-paragraph field order and the Commander's Estimate naturally find such structure comforting in dealing with the complexities of strategy. But those students also know from their experience in the field that there are limits to the scientific approach when dealing with human endeavors. As a consequence, they can also appreciate the art of mixing ends, ways, and means, using for each element some subjective and some objective criteria of suitability, feasibility, and applicability-the essence of strategic calculation.

In the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, there was a growing recognition of the increased complexity of strategy, summarized in Carl von Clausewitz's warning that "there can be no question of a purely military evaluation of a great strategic issue, nor of a purely military scheme to solve it."

We deliberately use the phrase 'with the addition of other means' because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different.... The main lines along which military events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.... War cannot be divorced from political life; and whenever this occurs in our thinking about war, the many links that connect the two elements are destroyed and we are left with something pointless and devoid of sense. 
10
This growing complexity in dealing with the strategic paradigm was compounded by two upheavals. Clausewitz was profoundly aware of one, the French Revolution; he was totally ignorant of the other, the Industrial/Technological Revolution. Prior to the French Revolution, 18th-century rulers had acquired such effective political and economic control over their people that they were able to create their war machines as separate and distinct from the rest of society. The Revolution changed all that with the appearance of a force "that beggared all imagination," as Clausewitz described it: 
Suddenly, war again became the business of the people-a people of thirty millions, all of whom considered themselves to be citizens. There seemed no end to the resources mobilized; all limits disappeared in the vigor and enthusiasm shown by governments and their subjects.... War, untrammeled by any, conventional restraints, had broken loose in all its elemental fury. This was due to the peoples' new share in these great affairs of state; and their participation, in its turn, resulted partly from the impact that the Revolution had on the internal conditions of every state and partly from the danger that France posed to everyone.

Clearly the tremendous effects of the French Revolution . . . were caused not so much by new military methods and concepts as by radical changes in policies and administration, by the new character of government, altered conditions of the French people, and the like.... It follows that the transformation of the art of war resulted from the transformation of politics.

In terms of the military element, technology would change the basic nature of weapons and modes of transportation, the former stable for a hundred years, the latter for a thousand. Within a decade of Clausewitz's death in 1831, that process would begin in armaments with the introduction of breech-loading firearms and in transportation with the development of the railroads." 15  Technology had a more gradual effect on the role of the people. There were, for example, the great European population increases of the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution moved on to the continent from Great Britain. This trend led, in turn, to urbanization: the mass movement of people from the extended families of rural life to the "atomized," impersonal life of the city. There, the urge to belong, to find a familial substitute, led to a more focused allegiance to the nation-state manifested in a new, more blatant and aggressive nationalism.
This nationalism was fueled by the progressive side effects of the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the area of public education, which meant, in turn, mass literacy throughout Europe by the end of the 19th century. One result was that an increasingly literate public could be manipulated by governments as technology spawned more sophisticated methods of mass communications. On the other hand, those same developments also helped democratize societies, which then demanded a greater share in government, particularly over strategic questions involving war and peace. In Clausewitz's time, strategic decisions dealing with such matters were rationally based on Realpolitik considerations to further state interests, not on domestic issues. By the end of the 19th century, the Rankeian Primat der Aussenpolitik was increasingly challenged throughout Europe by the need of governments for domestic consensus-a development with far-reaching implications for the conduct of strategy at the national level within the basic ends-ways-means paradigm. 
16
17
At the same time, this increased interaction between the government/military and the people was also tied to other aspects of the impact of technology on the Clausewitzian trinity. Technological innovations in weaponry during this period, for example, were not always followed by an understanding of their implications, societal as well as military. Certainly, there was the inability on the part of all European powers to perceive the growing advantage of defensive over offensive weapons demonstrated in the Boer and Russo-Japanese Wars. That inability was tied in with a trend in Europe at the time to combine elan with a military focus on moral force, bloodshed, and decisive battles. The result was that the military leaders of France, Germany, and Russia all adopted offensive military doctrines in some form.

Strategy changed irrevocably with the full confluence in World War I of the trends set in train by the Industrial and French revolutions. In particular, the technology in that war provided, as Hanson Baldwin has pointed out, "a preview of the Pandora's box of evils that the linkage of science with industry in the service of war was to mean."

Looking back over fifty years later on the totality of this change in what Clausewitz had termed policy, Admiral Eccles defined the concept of national strategy that emerged in World War I as "the comprehensive direction of all the elements of national power to achieve the national objectives."

The linchpin in this horizontal design is the military instrument of power at the national strategic level-the apex, as we have seen emerging in World War 1, of the vertical continuum of war (see Figure

Thus, the mix of ends, ways, and means at the national military strategic level will directly affect (and be affected by) the same paradigm operating at each level of the vertical continuum. Adding to the complexity is the interplay on the horizontal plane of national military strategy with the other strategies derived from the elements of national power, each operating within its own strategic paradigm and all contributing to the grand design of national strategy, as that strategy evolves within its own overall mix of ends, ways, and means. That this horizontal and vertical interplay has rendered the formulation and implementation of strategy at every level more difficult has become increasingly obvious. "Because these various elements of power cannot be precisely defined, compartmented, or divided," Admiral Eccles concluded about the "fog" of strategy, "it is normal to expect areas of ambiguity, overlap, and contention about authority among the various elements and members of any government."

The United States is in an era in which the strategic landscape has changed and is continuing to change. Nevertheless, the core problems that make strategy so difficult for a global power remain essentially the same as they did for earlier powers ranging from Rome to Great Britain. To begin with, there are challenges to U.S. interests throughout the globe. In a constantly changing strategic environment, however, it is difficult in many cases to distinguish which of those interests are vital, not to mention the nature of the challenge or threat to them. In any case, there are never enough armed forces to reduce the risk everywhere; strategic priorities have to be established.
In addition, like the leaders of earlier great powers, U.S. governmental elites have to grapple with the paradox of preparing for war, even in peacetime, if they wish to maintain the peace. The dilemma in the paradox that makes strategy in any era so difficult is that to overdo such preparations may weaken the economic, psychological, and political elements of power in the long run. The solution is to so balance the total ends, ways, and means that the natural tension in national security affairs between domestic and foreign policy is kept to a minimum while still securing the Figure

A SURVEY OF THE THEORY OF STRATEGY J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr.
A common language is both the product of and basis of any effective theory; people conversant in the theory habitually use words in the same way to mean the same thing. Such meanings may be unique to the theoretical context even if the word has other non-theoretical usages. Thus, the word "passion" used in a Christian context has an entirely different meaning than in secular usage. Similarly, doctrinal military terms, while hopefully used consistently by military individuals and organizations, may differ slightly (or even radically) in common usage. Strategy is such a word. Defining it is not as easy as one would think, and the definition is critical.
Part of the problem is that our understanding of strategy has changed over the years. The word has a military heritage, and classic theory considered it a purely wartime military activity-how generals employed their forces to win wars. In the classic usage, strategy was military maneuvers to get to a battlefield, and tactics took over once the forces were engaged. That purely military concept has given way to a more inclusive interpretation. The result is at least threefold: 1) Strategists generally insist that their art includes not only the traditional military element of power but also other elements of power like politics and economics. Most would also accept a peacetime as well as a wartime role for strategy. 2) With increased inclusiveness, the word "strategy" became available outside the military context and is now used in a variety of disciplines ranging from business to medicine and even sports. 3) As the concept mutated, the military had to invent another term-the U.S. settled on "operations" or "operational art"-to describe the high-level military art that had once been strategy. 
1
Surprisingly for such a significant term, there is no consensus on the definition of strategy even in the national security arena. The military community has an approved definition, but it is not well known and is not accepted by non-military national security professionals. As a consequence, every writer must either develop his or her own definition or pick from the numerous extant alternatives. We begin by surveying some of those alternatives.
Clausewitz wrote, "Strategy is the use of the engagement for the purpose of the war. The strategist must therefore define an aim for the entire operational side of the war that will be in accordance with its purpose. In other words, he will draft the plan of the war, and the aim will determine the series of actions intended to achieve it: he will, in fact, shape the individual campaigns and, within these, decide on the individual engagements." 
2
The 19th-century Swiss soldier and theorist Antoine Henri Jomini had his own definition.
Strategy is the art of making war upon the map, and comprehends the whole theater of war. Grand Tactics is the art of posting troops upon the battle-field according to the accidents of the ground, of bringing them into action, and the art of fighting upon the ground, in contradiction to planning upon a map. Its operations may extend over a field of ten or twelve miles in extent. Logistics comprises the means and arrangements which work out the plans of strategy and tactics. Strategy decides where to act; logistics brings the troops to this point; grand tactics decides the manner of execution and the employment of the troops. 
3
Civil War-era soldier and author Henry Lee Scott had an interesting definition derived from the basic Jominian concept: "…the art of concerting a plan of campaign, combining a system of military operations determined by the end to be attained, the character of the enemy, the nature and resources of the country, and the means of attack and defence [sic]." 
4
Military historian Basil H. Liddell Hart had another unique approach to the subject. Because he wrote as the concept of strategy was expanding to include more non-military aspects, his definition is more modern. Liddell Hart defined strategy as: "the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy." Also: "Strategy depends for success, first and most, on a sound calculation and coordination of the ends and the means. The end must be proportioned to the total means, and the means used in gaining each intermediate end which contributes to the ultimate must be proportioned to the value and needs of that intermediate end-whether it be to gain an object of to fulfill a contributory purpose. An excess may be as harmful as a deficiency." Liddell Hart was talking specifically about military strategy, and he thought strategy was something akin to but different from the more expansive concept of grand strategy.
As tactics is an application of strategy on a lower plane, so strategy is an application on a lower plane of 'grand strategy'….While practically synonymous with the policy which guides the conduct of war, as distinct from the more fundamental policy which should govern its objective, the term 'grand strategy' serves to bring out the sense of 'policy in execution.' For the role of grand strategy-higher strategy-is to coordinate all the resources of a nation, or a band of nations, towards the attainment of the political object of the war-the goal defined by fundamental policy.
Grand strategy should both calculate and develop the economic resources and man-power of nations in order to sustain the fighting services. Also the moral resources-for to foster the people's willing spirit is often as important as to possess the more concrete forms of power. Grand strategy, too, should regulate the distribution of power between the services, and between the services and industry. Moreover, fighting power is but one of the instruments of grand strategy-which should take account of and apply the power of financial pressure, of diplomatic pressure, of commercial pressure, and, not the least of ethical pressure, to weaken the opponent's will….Furthermore, while the horizon of strategy is bounded by the war, grand strategy looks beyond the war to the subsequent peace. It should not only combine the various instruments, but so regulate their use as to avoid damage to the future state of peace-for its security and prosperity. The sorry state of peace, for both sides, that has followed most wars can be traced to the fact that, unlike strategy, the realm of grand strategy is for the most part terra incognita-still awaiting exploration, and understanding. 
5
Contemporary strategist Colin Gray has a more comprehensive definition. "By strategy I mean the use that is made of force and the threat of force for the ends of policy [emphasis in original]." 
6
The U.S. military has an approved joint definition of strategy: "The art and science of developing and employing instruments of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theater, national, and/or multinational objectives." Unfortunately, that definition only recognizes strategy as a national security function, and although it is significantly better than earlier definitions, it remains fairly broad. The explanation in the Joint Encyclopedia goes a little further: "These strategies integrate national and military objectives (ends), national policies and military concepts (ways), and national resources and military forces and supplies (means)." That is more satisfactory, although still focused exclusively on national security issues, which is understandable considering the source. However, the Joint definition of national military strategy shows that the Joint community is divided or at least inconsistent on this subject. "National Military Strategy: The art and science of distributing and applying military power to attain national objectives in peace or war." That is a pure "how-to" definition-at best a correlation of objectives with methods with the emphasis on methods. There is no consideration of or recognition of the importance of developing means; there is also no consideration of developing military objectives to accomplish national objectives. The encyclopedia's further explanation of that term goes into the formal document of the National Military Strategy rather than the concept. 
7
The second definition is really closer to a definition of grand strategic art, but if one cut it off after "means," it would be essentially the same as the first definition. 
8
That is also the typical short-term planning process that a theater commander might do. He cannot quickly change the means available, so he has to determine how to best use what is on hand to accomplish the mission.
Before we proceed, it is useful to address the issue of whether strategy is really necessary. It is certainly possible to conduct a war without a strategy. One can imagine very fierce combat divorced from any coherent (or even incoherent) plan for how that fighting would achieve the aims of the war-fighting for the sake of fighting. Alternatively, preemptive surrender is always an option for the state interested in avoiding strategic decisions; the only drawback is that preemptive surrender is incapable of achieving positive political objectives other than avoidance of conflict. Rational states, however, will always attempt to address their interests by relating ends with ways and means. Given the fact that they are fighting for some reason-that is, they have an end-there will be some (even if unconscious) design of how to use the available means to achieve it. Thus, while strategy may not technically be necessary, it is almost always present-even if poorly conceived and executed.
One can test a possible strategy by examining it for suitability, acceptability, and feasibility. Those three nouns test each of the three components of strategy. Suitability tests whether the proposed strategy achieves the desired end-if it does not, it is not a potential strategy. Acceptability tests ways. Does the proposed course of action or concept produce results without excessive expenditure of resources and within accepted modes of conduct? Feasibility tests means. Are the means at hand or reasonably available sufficient to execute the proposed concept? A strategy must meet or at least have a reasonable expectation of meeting all three tests to be valid, but there is no upper limit on the number of possible solutions. The art becomes the analysis necessary to select the best or most efficient or least risky.
Of the three tests, suitability and feasibility are fairly straightforward and require no further explication. Acceptability, however, has some complicating features. The morality and legality of strategies is an obvious case in point-morality and legality vary widely by nation, culture, and even individual. But those are not the only complicating features of acceptability. For example, Colin Gray talks about what he calls the social dimension of strategy "...strategy is made and executed by the institutions of particular societies in ways that express cultural preferences." 
9
The U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 is an example of this phenomenon. It was an invasion of a sovereign foreign nation justified by fairly innocuous (certainly not vital) political issues. That was against the norms of all three legs of the American trinity; however, the government had convinced itself that action was necessary, and the military agreed or at least obeyed orders. The potential glitch was the response of the American people. Initial reaction was the predictable support for troops being deployed in harm's way. That support could have quickly turned into opposition had the operation not been extremely rapid and relatively casualty-free.
Even though one might occasionally get away with violating norms, one cannot safely violate deeply held norms even briefly. Thus, the U.S. has a norm against assassination (reinforced by a self-imposed presidential directive that adds a legal dimension). Our current mode of declaring that the people of an adversarial country are good but their leader is evil screams for a decapitation strategy executed by assassination. That will not happen. Beyond the question of legality, it would never pass the acceptability test of any of the trinitarian elements.
It is also important to note that these tests are not designed to determine if a strategy is either good or will work. The tests are for appropriateness, and they are not even conclusive in that respect. Although failure to meet the requirements of suitability, acceptability, and feasibility is often obvious, passing those same requirements is a matter both subjective, open to interpretation, and inconclusive. The best analysis may suggest that a strategy is suitable, feasible, and acceptable, but that absolutely does not guarantee success. There will always be risk and unforeseen consequences of action with which the strategist must cope. The best the tests can do is weed out inappropriate strategies.
There are several ways to categorize strategies. One has a conceptual basis: strategy can be declaratory, actual, or ideal. Declaratory strategy is what a nation says its strategy is. Declaratory strategy may or may not be the nation's true strategy, and the nation may or may not actually believe it. A good example is America's two Major Theater of War (MTW) strategy. For years the official (declared) strategy of the U.S. was to be able to fight two near-simultaneous MTWs; however, most analysts and many military personnel were convinced such a strategy was impossible to execute with existing means. Regardless, the U.S. must maintain some form of two MTW strategy, despite recent modifications and adjustments, as its declared strategy even if the administration in power determines that it does not have and is unwilling to buy the resources to execute the strategy. A nation with pretensions to world power cannot easily change or back down from longdeclared strategies, and a declared two MTW capability provides a useful deterrent effect. Actual strategy addresses the difference between the declared strategy and reality. It asks the question, "Assuming the U.S. cannot execute its declared two MTW strategy, what is its real strategy?" That real strategy would be an actual strategy. An ideal strategy is what a strategist would prefer to do if he had unlimited access to all the necessary resources (both quantitative and qualitative). It is a textbook strategy and may or may not correspond to reality.
A second method of categorization is based on the pattern of execution: sequential, simultaneous, and cumulative. This paradigm attempts to make distinctions between strategies based on whether the strategist is attacking objectives progressively, simultaneously, or in essentially random order. Thus, a typical sequential campaign would involve actions to gain control of the air, followed by efforts to defeat the enemy's fielded forces, and culminate in the attack on or occupation of political objectives. A simultaneous campaign would include near-simultaneous attacks on each of those target sets. A cumulative strategy produces results not by any single action or sequence of actions but by the cumulative effect of numerous actions over time. A commerce-raiding strategy is a classic example. The loss of a single ship is not especially significant; there is no need to sink ships in any order; while specific types of ships (like tankers) might be more valuable than others, the loss of any ship contributes directly to victory. The effectiveness of the strategy comes from cumulative losses over time. Although cumulative strategies have never taken on the luster that Admiral J. C. Wylie, the man who first recognized them as a separate category of strategy, hoped, they do allow conceptualization or categorization of strategy based on the pattern of execution. 
10
Attrition seeks victory through the gradual destruction (by a long campaign or series of campaigns) of the enemy's armed forces. Exhaustion seeks to erode the will and resources of the enemy nation/state rather than the armed forces. Recently, Russell Weigley has opined that, at least in his classic book The American Way of War, he should have replaced "attrition" with "erosion" as a characterization of U.S. strategy. He believes the term is less confusing and actually better portrays certain aspects of American strategy. Erosion would be closer in meaning to exhaustion than attrition, except that-and this is only a tentative interpretation of Weigley's brief and incomplete explanation of the concept-it would aim more directly at the political or governmental will than at popular support or resources. 
11
The historian Michael Howard postulated a strategic paradigm based on deterrence, compellence, and reassurance. Military power can deter other states from doing something or it can compel them to do something. "Reassurance provides a general sense of security that is not specific to any particular threat or scenario." Pax Britannica is the best example. The British navy provided world-wide security through its control of the seas. That security translated into general peace. 
12
Another way, as mentioned briefly above, to categorize strategy is as organizational or hierarchical. That is the method that talks about grand or national strategy at one level and theater, campaign, or operational strategy at another level. The term "operational strategy" is one that theorist André Beaufre and historian Alan T. Nolan use, but it is confusing, unnecessarily mixes terms, and is uncommon at best in the literature. We will omit the term from further discussions, but it does highlight one significant issue. There is a basic theoretical question about the legitimacy of strategy at the operational level-we are purposefully mixing apples and oranges for no discernible gain in clarity, utility, or comprehension. This confusion only expands as operational art edges more into the strategic realm. While I personally oppose calling theater plans strategic, current U.S. joint doctrine accepts it, and I will follow that doctrine.
Grand or national strategy is associated with actions at the state/national level. The U.S. Army War College defines it as "a country's broadest approach to the pursuit of its national objectives in the international system." 
13
Current U.S. military doctrine recognizes four categories of power available to a nation or strategist: diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (often referred to using the shorthand DIME). Other potential candidates include social/psychological, which was an accepted category until recently, and political. While political and diplomatic appear to be similar and are frequently used synonymously, I believe they are actually different. To me, political refers to the power generated internally or domestically, while diplomatic refers exclusively to power in the international arena-the ability to influence adversaries, allies, and neutrals. Political power is important for generating or sustaining support for the policy/strategy or popular will. Regimes with little domestic support (and thus, little political power) have difficulty executing their international policies. Social/psychological power was very similar to political power in some respects, but also contained elements of informational power. Since its major components were subsumed in other terms, social/psychological power fell into disuse.
In a war, the other elements of power (and the strategies developed for their employment) tend to support the military element; however, there is always a symbiotic relationship between the elements. Thus, diplomatic strategy may support military strategy, but military success may be an essential precursor for diplomatic success. Similarly, economic strategy may be designed to provide military means, but the military capture or loss of economic assets may directly influence the effectiveness of the economic strategy. Additionally, different types of warfare emphasize different elements of power. For example, in a civil war, the political element becomes especially important. It is for just this reason that the Washington community dealing with the War on Terrorism (WOT) has adopted a new model to think about power. Besides the traditional DIME elements, the counterterrorist community has added intelligence, legal or law enforcement, and financial to its list of elements of power-giving the acronym MIDLIFE or DIMEFIL. Those are useful tools to consider in the WOT, although the expanded categories of national power have not gained broad acceptance beyond the counterterrorism community.
Does (or should) one's strategy necessarily change based on the type of war he is fighting? If strategy is a function of ends, then it ought to change or be different as the political ends change. The alternative view, however, is that destroying the enemy's military force is always the best (to some theorists, the only legitimate) objective for the military regardless of political goals. This gets to what Clausewitz called the supreme judgment about a war-its nature. "The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive." 
14
The inclusion of potential changes in the nature of a war during its conduct raises another important question. If the nature of a war can change, then is not trying to shape that nature into a form that suits the strategist a legitimate strategic exercise? Is Clausewitz overlooking a useful strategic tool when he warns against trying to turn a war into something alien to its nature? Strategists should certainly try to control or influence the nature of a war as much as possible. The problem is when they do not recognize that their efforts have failed and persist in fighting the wrong kind of war. Thus, in the 1960's, the United States might legitimately have tried to turn the Vietnam war into a conventional international war between North and South Vietnam-that was the war the U.S. military was best prepared to win. However, when that effort failed, the strategists should have recognized that fact and adapted to the true nature of the war they were fighting. Unfortunately, that did not occur until it was too late to win that war; paradoxically, the nature of the war changed again in 1975, and the war became precisely the conventional international war the United States had initially wanted.
Next we need to consider a few theories on potential ways to execute strategy. Knowing that strategy is a considered relation among ends, ways, and means is a necessary first step, but it does not help one actually do anything. Fortunately, hundreds of authors have given their thoughts on how to conduct strategy. Some are better than others. Most are "ways" determinations rather than comprehensive ends-ways-means analyses. Still, they are worth consideration. At a minimum, a competent strategist should be aware of each.
The ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu did not define strategy, but he offered pointers on its practice. At times, Sun Tzu can be so straightforward he is simplistic. For example, the statement, "Victory is the main object of war," is not especially informative. One can make all the tortuous interpretations one likes, but the statement is blunt and obvious in its intent. That is not to say it is trivial-in fact, it is well for anyone involved with war to remember that the object is to win-it is just wrong as an absolute. The object of war is not victory, but, as Liddell Hart says, "a better peace-even of only from your own point of view." One can strive so hard for victory that he destroys the subsequent peace. Liddell Hart again says, "A State which expends its strength to the point of exhaustion bankrupts its own policy, and future. If you concentrate exclusively on victory, with no thought for the after-effect, you may be too exhausted to profit by the peace, while it is almost certain that the peace will be a bad one, containing the germs of another war." Victory is certainly better than the alternative, but it cannot be the exclusive aim of war. I expound on that for two reasons. First, Sun Tzu should be treated like Jay Luvass recommended using Clausewitz-the fact that he said something makes it worthy of consideration. Second, the fact that Sun Tzu is both an ancient and an Asian author does not automatically mean he had all the answers or even addressed all the questions. There is a tendency to read volumes into fairly straightforward passages of Sun Tzu on the assumption that there must be something of deep significance behind each phrase of the book. In many (if not most) cases, the phrases actually mean exactly what they say. Sun Tzu was not saying that war is a political act when he said, "War is a matter of vital importance to the State"-reading the rest of the quote makes it quite apparent he was simply saying war is important and must be studied. 
15
It is commonplace to acknowledge that Sun Tzu advocated deception and winning without fighting. For example, he wrote, "For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill." Sun Tzu has become the intellectual father of a school of warfare that advocates winning by maneuver or by psychologically dislocating the opponent. Although undesirable, the ancient Chinese soldier might not be as pleased about that paternity as his advocates believe. Sun Tzu expended lots of effort explaining how to maneuver and fight. In some respects, he is very like Jomini (of all people). For example, Sun Tzu advocated attacking portions of the enemy with your whole force: "If I am able to determine the enemy's dispositions while at the same time I conceal my own then I can concentrate and he must divide. And if I concentrate while he divides, I can use my entire strength to attack a fraction of his." Sun Tzu thought that the defense was the stronger form of warfare but that offensive action was necessary for victory. "Invincibility lies in the defence [sic]; the possibility of victory in the attack….One defends when his strength is inadequate; he attacks when it is abundant." He sometimes did incomplete analysis and thus provided advice that might be wrong, depending on the circumstances. For example, Sun Tzu said, "To be certain to take what you attack is to attack a place the enemy does not protect." It is easy to use that quote as an advocacy for Liddell Hart's indirect approach. That is, attack where the enemy does not expect. The problem is that there is almost always a reason why the enemy does not defend a place, and it usually has to do with the limited value of that place. However, Sun Tzu was not setting up Liddell Hart. The line after the original quote changes the meaning of the entire passage: "To be certain to hold what you defend is to defend a place the enemy does not attack." 
16
Clausewitz is generally more useful for his philosophical musings on the nature of war than his "how-to" strategic advice. In that arena, much of what he preached was either commonplace or 19th century specific. The exceptions are three. First was his advocacy of seeking battle. This obviously sets him apart from Sun Tzu and many others, and Clausewitz is quite specific about his expectations of decisive battle. He wrote, …the importance of the victory is chiefly determined by the vigor with which the immediate pursuit is carried out. In other words, pursuit makes up the second act of the victory and in many cases is more important than the first. Strategy at this point draws near to tactics in order to receive the completed assignment from it; and its first exercise of authority is to demand that the victory should really be complete. 
17
18
Clausewitz's final significant "how-to" idea is the concept of the culminating point. "There are strategic attacks that have led directly to peace, but these are the minority. Most of them only lead up to the point where their remaining strength is just enough to maintain a defense and wait for peace. Beyond that point the scale turns and the reaction follows with a small force that is usually much stronger than that of the original attack. This is what we mean by the culminating point of the attack." 
19
The Baron Antoine Jomini, a contemporary of Clausewitz with service in the French and Russian armies during the Napoleonic wars, also gave modern U.S. theory and doctrine several terms. He was much more specific in his "how-to" analysis than Clausewitz. Jomini believed war was a science and consequently one could discover, by careful study, rules about how it should be conducted. He offered the results of his study. Jomini is often criticized for being geometric; al-though such a depiction overlooks some aspects of his work, it is not totally unfair. Jomini was specific about how to plan a campaign. First, one selected the theater of war. Next, one determined the decisive points in the theater. Selection of bases and zones of operation followed. Then one designated the objective point. The line of operations was then the line from the base through the decisive points to the objective point. Thus, the great principle of war "which must be followed in all good combinations" was contained in four maxims:
1. To throw by strategic movements the mass of an army, successively, upon the decisive points of a theater of war, and also upon the communications of the enemy as much as possible without compromising one's own. 2. To maneuver to engage fractions of the hostile army with the bulk of one's forces.
3. On the battlefield, to throw the mass of the forces upon the decisive point, or upon that portion of the hostile line which is of first importance to overthrow.
4. To so arrange that these masses shall not only be thrown upon the decisive point, but that they shall engage at the proper time and with energy. 
20
B. H. Liddell Hart had his own approach to strategy, which has become famous as the indirect approach.
Strategy has not to overcome resistance, except from nature. Its purpose is to diminish the possibility of resistance, and it seeks to fulfill this purpose by exploiting the elements of movement and surprise….Although strategy may aim more at exploiting movement than at exploiting surprise, or conversely, the two elements react on each other. Movement generates surprise, and surprise gives impetus to movement.

The French general and theoretician André Beaufre provided another way to think about strategy. He made significant contributions to deterrence theory, especially in his skepticism of the deterrent effect of conventional forces and his advocacy of an independent French nuclear force; however, his main contribution was in the realm of general strategy. Beaufre published an influential trilogy of short books in the mid-1960s: An Introduction to Strategy, Deterrence and Strategy, and Strategy of Action. 
24
Beaufre recognized the criticality of non-military elements of power-political, economic, etc. He also recognized that strategy was neither an exclusively wartime activity nor restricted to planning against an enemy-one might have strategies for relations with friends or allies as well. Beaufre is sometimes credited with expanding the concept of strategy beyond the purely military, although contemporaries were already doing that under the rubric of grand strategy-a term Beaufre disliked and replaced in his own writing with "total strategy." Total strategy defined at the highest national level how the war would be fought and coordinated the application of all the elements of power. Below total strategy was a level Beaufre called overall strategy, which allocated tasks and coordinated the activities for a single element of power (essentially national-level sub-or supporting strategies like a National Military Strategy or a National Economic Strategy). Below overall strategy was operational strategy, which corresponded fairly closely to the modern concept of operational art. 
25

29
Another of Beaufre's major concepts was the strategy of action. This was a counterpart to deterrence. When deterring, the state wanted its opponent to refrain from doing something, while an action strategy aimed at causing someone to do something. The aim of one was negative and the other, positive. Other authors at the time and since have called this coercion, and Beaufre used that term, but he thought coercion too often implied use of military force and wanted action to include a broader range of options.

31
Edward Luttwak, an economist and historian who has written extensively on strategic theory, talks about attrition and maneuver as the forms of strategy. For Luttwak, attrition is the application of superior firepower and material strength to eventually destroy the enemy's entire force unless he surrenders or retreats. The enemy is nothing more than a target array to be serviced by industrial methods. The opposite of attrition warfare is relational maneuver-"action related to the specifics of the objective. " The goal of relational maneuver-instead of physically destroying the enemy, as in attrition-is to incapacitate his systems. Those systems might be the enemy's command and control or his fielded forces or even his doctrine or perhaps the spatial deployment of his force, as in the penetration of a linear position. In some cases relational maneuver might entail the attack of actual technical systems-Luttwak uses deception of radar rather than its destruction or jamming to illustrate the final category.

34
The large claim I advance here is that strategy does not merely entail this or that paradoxical proposition, contradictory and yet recognized as valid, but rather that the entire realm of strategy is pervaded by a paradoxical logic of its own, standing against the ordinary linear logic by which we live in all other spheres of life (except for warlike games, of course).
He believes paradoxical logic pervades the five levels (technical, tactical, operational, theater strategic, and grand strategic) and two dimensions (vertical across levels and horizontal in levels) of warfare. 
35
36
To have the advantage of an enemy who cannot react because he is surprised and unready, or at least who cannot react promptly and in full force, all sorts of paradoxical choices may be justified….Surprise can now be recognized for what it is: not merely one factor of advantage in warfare among many others, but rather the suspension, if only briefly, if only partially, of the entire predicament of strategy, even as the struggle continues. Without a reacting enemy, or rather according to the extent and degree that surprise is achieved, the conduct of war becomes mere administration.

Martin Van Creveld's The Transformation of War is, according at least to the cover, "The most radical reinterpretation of armed conflict since Clausewitz." He represents a segment of modern scholars that believe Clausewitz no longer explains why, how, or by whom wars are fought. To Van Creveld, war is no longer a rational political act conducted among states-if it ever was. He points out that in 1991, warfare waged by non-state actors dominated conflict-rather than the organized, political, inter-state warfare between great powers that the international community seemed to expect (and Clausewitz seemed to predict). War is no longer fought by the entities we always assumed fought wars. The combatants in modern wars no longer fight for the reasons we always believed. Finally, they do not fight in the manner we always accepted as standard. 
41
Should the states in question fail to recognize the changed reality, they will first become incapable of wielding appropriate force at all and eventually cease to exist as recognizable states.

It is unclear how well known or influential Malik's Quranic Concept of War is in the Muslim world. General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, who had overthrown the Pakistani government and was both President and Chief of Staff of the Army when Malik published his book, wrote a brief forward recommending and endorsing the book. Similarly, Allah Bukhsh K. Brohi, the Advocate-General of Pakistan, wrote a long Preface endorsing the most expansive concepts Malik found in the Quran. The publishers of the electronic version of the book claim it has been discovered on the bodies of dead jihadists in Afghanistan. 
60
There are also whole categories we can only classify as miscellaneous, alternative, possibly, strategic concepts: Denial, Punishment, and Coercion.
These are proposed replacements for attrition, exhaustion, and annihilation. They actually describe the ends of strategy (or perhaps a limited set of ways) rather than a complete strategic concept. Their utility is limited and their acceptance as a group by the strategic community is minimal at best. Coercion, of course, is a recognized strategic concept on its own; it is just not commonly grouped with denial and punishment as a paradigm.
Historian Archer Jones has a unique approach to strategy.
The object for military strategy used herein is the depletion of the military force of an adversary. The definition of political-military strategy, a companion term, is the use of military force to attain political or related objectives directly, rather than by depleting an adversary's military force. Of course, military strategy usually endeavored to implement political or comparable objectives but sought to attain them indirectly, by depleting the hostile military force sufficiently to gain an ascendancy adequate to attain the war's political goals.

An attractive recent concept is a strategy we might characterize as decapitation, in which one targets specifically and selectively the enemy leader or at least a fairly limited set of upper-echelon leaders. This has most recently found expression in the expressed strategic objective of regime change, which tends to automatically focus on the enemy regime leadership regardless of the potential scope of the mission. Strategic treatises like the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Strategy, which use regime change as an evaluative factor, hint at a widening acceptance of the concept. A primary assumption, generally implied or asserted without proof, is that the current leader (perhaps aided by a small group of accomplices) is the whole cause of the interna-tional dispute. A corollary assumption is that eliminating the current evil leadership will result in its replacement by a regime willing to grant the concessions demanded by the opposing state or coalition.
There are several problems with this approach-most related to the validity of the assumptions. First, the assumption that the common people of a country are good and could not possibly support the policies of their evil ruler is (as a minimum) unproven in most cases and palpably false in many. Thus, decapitation will not solve the problem. In Clausewitzian terms, taking out the government does not automatically destroy or break the will of either the people or the military. Second, a potential follow-on regime can be either better than, about the same as, or worse than the current leadership. Hence, the odds of achieving one's policy objectives by decapitation are actually fairly poor. The U.S. experience in Iraq after successfully removing Saddam Hussein's regime demonstrate these caveats. The old saw about contending with the devil one knows may be worn, but that does not make it any less worthwhile advice, and while decapitation may work, it is neither easy nor a panacea.
U.S. Air Force Colonel John R. Boyd talks about the "OODA loop"-that is, the decision cycle of observation, orientation, decision, and action. The concept is derived from a fighter pilot in a dogfight. Like the pilot, a strategist wins by outthinking and outmaneuvering his opponent; by the time the opponent decides what to do and initiates action it is too late, since you have already anticipated and countered his move or made a countermove that makes his action meaningless. One accomplishes this by possessing sufficient agility to be able, both mentally and physically, to act a step or more ahead of the enemy. Thus, the successful strategist always works inside his enemy's decision cycle. 
64
Another U.S. Air Force Colonel, John A. Warden III, translated his targeteering experience into a strategic theory, thus elevating the tactical process of allocating aircraft sorties to specific targets to a strategic theory. Warden views the enemy as a system of targets arrayed in five strategic rings; the innermost and most important is leadership. One can win by striking that inner ring so frequently and violently that the enemy is essentially paralyzed and never able to mount an effective defense. It is unnecessary to take on the outer and much more difficult target rings like the enemy's armed forces, although modern advances like stealth technology make simultaneous attack of the entire target array possible (instead of the traditional sequential attacks, in which one array had to be neutralized before proceeding to the next). 
65
There are also a number of alternative strategies that seem to be intended specifically for, or at least, to be most appropriate for, weaker powers or underdogs:
Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus was a Roman general during the Second Punic War. He advocated avoiding open battle, because he was convinced the Romans would lose, which they proceed to do when they abandoned his strategy. Thus, Fabian strategy is a strategy in which one side intentionally avoids large-scale battle for fear of the outcome. Victory depends on wearing down (attriting) one's opponent over time-usually by an unrelenting campaign of skirmishes between detachments. Somewhat akin to a Fabian strategy is a strategy of survival. In that case, however, the weaker power does not necessarily avoid battle. Instead, one reacts to his opponent's moves rather than make an effort to seize the initiative. The object is to survive rather than to win in the classic sense-hopefully, sheer survival achieves (or perhaps comprises) one's political aim. This is a favorite alternative strategy of modern critics for the Confederate States of America. Scorched-earth strategies are another variant of the basic Fabian strategy. The concept is to withdraw slowly before an enemy, while devastating the countryside over which he must advance so he cannot subsist his force on your terrain. Attrition will eventually halt the attack-it will reach what Clausewitz called a culminating point-and the retreating side can safely assume the offensive. This is actually the addition of a tactical technique to the basic Fabian strategy and not a major new school of strategy.
There is a whole subset of doctrine under the general heading of strategies for the weak that advocates guerrilla warfare, insurgency, and/or terrorism:
T. E. (Thomas Edward) Lawrence was the first of the theorists of insurgency or revolutionary warfare. His Seven Pillars of Wisdom, originally published in 1926, recounted his experiences with Arab insurgent forces fighting the Turks in World War I. 
66
67
68
69
Mao Zedong developed the most famous and influential theory of insurgency warfare. His concepts, designed initially for the Chinese fight against the Japanese in World War II, have been expanded and adapted by himself and others to become a general theory of revolutionary warfare. Mao emphasizes the political nature of war and the reliance of the army on the civilian population, especially the Chinese peasant population. He advocated a protracted war against the Japanese; victory would come in time through attrition. He believed the Chinese should avoid large battles except in the rare instances when they had the advantage. Guerrillas should normally operate dispersed across the countryside and concentrate only to attack. Because the Chinese had a regular army contending with the Japanese, Mao had to pay particular attention to how guerrilla and regular operations complemented each other. He postulated a progressive campaign that would move slowly and deliberately from a stage when the Chinese were on the strategic defensive through a period of strategic stalemate to the final stage when Chinese forces assumed the strategic offensive. The ratio of forces and their tactical activities in each stage reflected the strategic realities of the environment. Thus, guerrilla forces and tactics dominated the phase of the strategic defensive. During the strategic stalemate, mobile and guerrilla warfare would complement each other, and guerrilla and regular forces would reach approximate equilibrium (largely by guerrilla forces combining and training into progressively larger regular units). Mobile warfare conducted by regular units would dominate the period of strategic offensive. Although guerrilla units would never completely disappear, the regular forces would achieve the final victory. 
70
Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna based his theory of revolutionary warfare on the Cuban model. He offered a definition of strategy that highlighted his variation of the basic guerrilla theme-especially his divergence from the Maoist emphasis on the political nature of the conflict and reliance on the people. Che wrote, "In guerrilla terminology, strategy means the analysis of the objectives we wish to attain. First, determine how the enemy will operate, his manpower, mobility, popular support, weapons, and leadership, Then, plan a strategy to best confront these factors, always keeping in mind that the final objective is to destroy the enemy army." To Che the major lessons of the Cuban Revolution were that guerrillas could defeat regular armies; that it was unnecessary to wait for all the political preconditions to be met before beginning the fight-the insurrection itself would produce them; and that the countryside was the arena for conflict in underdeveloped Latin America. Gradual progress through the Maoist stages of revolution was unnecessary-the guerrilla effort could not only establish the political preconditions of revolution but also win the war on its own. Parties, doctrine, theories, and even political causes were unimportant. The armed insurgency would eventually produce them all. 
71
Although there is no outstanding single theorist of terrorism, it is not a new strategic concept. Often used as a tactical part or preliminary stage of a larger campaign or insurgency, terrorism can, if fact, be a strategy, and sometimes even a goal in itself. Many ideological terrorists-perhaps the best examples are ecological terrorists-have no desire or intent to progress militarily beyond terrorism. Although political, most are not interested in overthrowing a government or seizing control of conventional political power. They simply want their espoused policies, ideologies, or political agendas adopted. Alternatively, anarchists, who traditionally have used terror, just want to destroy government without replacing it. They have no positive goal whatever.
The theory behind terrorism is fairly straightforward. A weak, usually non-governmental, actor uses violence, either random or carefully targeted and often directed against civilian targets, to produce terror. The aim is to make life so uncertain and miserable that the state against which the terror is directed concedes whatever political, social, economic, environmental, or theological point the terrorist pursues. The technique has not proven particularly effective as a standalone strategy in changing important policies in even marginally effective states. It is, however, comparatively cheap, easy to conceptualize and execute, requires minimal training, is relatively safe-since competent terrorist groups are extremely difficult to eradicate-and is demonstrably effective in gaining the terrorist publicity for himself and the cause.
If there are strategies for the weak, the strong are sure to develop counter-strategies. Opponents generally fight a Fabian strategy by trying to exert enough pressure or threaten some critical location or capability to bring about the battle the Fabian strategist is trying to avoid. There is (and needs to be) no body of theoretical work on countering Fabian strategies. The same, however, cannot be said of countering insurgencies and terrorism.
Formal modern counterinsurgency theory developed as a result of the insurgencies that sprang up after World War II in the decolonizing world. It tended to be symmetric in the sense that it analyzed insurgencies and then attempted to beat them at their own game and in their chosen arena. Modern counterinsurgency theory tends to recognize the political nature of most insurgencies and approach them holistically rather than from a primarily military point of view. That is a fairly big break with traditional counterinsurgency techniques, that predominately concentrated on locating and destroying the guerrillas and often relied heavily on punishing the local population for guerrilla activity as the sole means of separating the guerrilla from his base of support. Discussion of some representative modern counterinsurgency theorists follows:
Callwell. British Colonel Charles E. Callwell wrote Small Wars-Their Principles and Practice at the end of the 19th century. This was a guide for the conduct of colonial wars. Callwell distinguished three broad categories of small wars, which he defined as any war in which one side was not a regular army. His categories were: campaigns of conquest or annexation; campaigns to suppress insurgents; and campaigns to punish or overthrow dangerous enemies. Each was fundamentally different from any form of regular warfare. Small wars could take almost any shape-the most dangerous of which was guerrilla warfare. Callwell gave sound tactical advice about fighting a colonial or guerrilla enemy, but, from a theoretical or strategic point of view, his advice is of limited value. He recognized that colonial enemies could be skilled and dedicated warriors and recommended treating them as such-a refreshing change from standard colonial views. However, Callwell thought the small-wars experience was both exclusively military and unique to the colonies. He thus both did not develop the multi-disciplinary approach common to modern counterinsurgency strategy and did not recommend translating the colonial military lessons into lessons for the big wars of the European colonial powers. He thought the strategic aim of counterinsurgency was to fight, because the counterinsurgents had the tactical advantage but were at a strategic disadvantage. Callwell, while still touted today and worth a look for his tactical precepts, was a theoretical dead end for the strategist. 
72
Roger Trinquier published Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency in 1961. Trinquier served with the French paras in Indochina and Algeria. Those experiences shaped his views, and his theory heavily reflects French counterinsurgency practice in the 1950s. Trinquier argued that nuclear weapons were decreasing the significance of major traditional wars. The new form of war, which he called modern warfare (always in italics for emphasis), featured guerrilla war, insurgency, terrorism, and subversion. One of the major assumptions of modern war was that victory would not come from the clash of armies on battlefields, but from control of the support of the population. 
73
Trinquier suggested three principles: separate the guerrilla from the population, occupy the zones the guerrilla previously used to deny him reentry, and coordinate actions over a wide enough area and long enough time to deny the guerrilla access to the population.

David Galula wrote Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice in 1964. He postulated a simple construct for counterinsurgencies that emphasized the political nature of the conflict, especially the relationship between the insurgent and his cause. His definition of "[i]nsurgency is the pursuit of the policy of a party, inside a country, by every means" was designed to emphasize that insurgencies could start before the use of force. Insurgencies are by their nature asymmetric because of the disparity of resources between the contenders. The counterinsurgent has all the tangible assets-military, police, finance, court systems, etc., while the insurgent's advantages are intangible-the ideological power of his cause. Insurgents base their strategies on powerful ideologies, while the counterinsurgent has to maintain order without undermining the government.
The rules applicable to one side do not always fit the other. The logic of this asymmetric power relationship forced the insurgent to avoid military confrontation and instead move the contest to a new arena where his ideological power was effective-the population became the seat of war.
Politics becomes the instrument of war rather than force, and that remains true throughout the war. Politics takes longer to produce effects, so all insurgencies are protracted.

Frank Kitson wrote Low Intensity Operations: Subversion, Insurgency, and Peacekeeping in 1971. He added details to the basic structure of counterinsurgency theory already constructed by the French. Like the other theorists, Kitson recognized that counterinsurgency is a multidisciplinary job. He warned against abuses, but recommended that heavy force be used early to squash an insurgency while still in a manageable state. The military campaign must be coordinated with good psychological operations. Kitson conceptualized two kinds of intelligence-political and operational. Political intelligence is an ongoing process, while operational intelligence supports specific military operations. The military must be involved in the intelligence-gathering process (political as well as operational). Counterinsurgency forces must be attuned to the environment, able to optimize resources by phases of the campaign, and able to coordinate all the resources at their disposal. 81
There are also numerous advice books that give leaders and decisionmakers more or less specific advice about what to do or how to do it without necessarily offering a comprehensive strategic or theoretical paradigm. Examples include Niccolo Machiavelli's The Art of War, The Discourses, and The Prince, written to influence 16th-century Florentine leaders, and Frederick the Great's Instructions for His Generals, the title of which explains its intent. Alternatively, there are collections like The Military Maxims of Napoleon of military advice culled from the writings of great soldiers. As historian David Chandler noted in his introduction to a recent reprint of that work, 'The practical value of military maxims can be debatable….Consequently the collecting of his [Napoleon's] obiter dicta into any kind of military rule-book for future generations to apply is a process fraught with perils and pitfalls." In a more modern vein, Michele A. Flournoy, ed., QDR 2001: Strategy-Driven Choices for America's Security is essentially an advice book that presents a specific strategic solution without developing an overarching strategic theory. 
82
During the Cold War the nuclear weapons field developed its own set of specific strategies based on deterrence theory. Deterrence theory itself is a useful strategic concept. Conversely, concepts like mutual assured destruction, counterforce or counter-value targeting, launch on warning, and first strike versus retaliation are terms of nuclear art that will retain some relevance as long as major nations maintain large nuclear stockpiles, but they no longer dominate the strategic debate as they once did. According to the Department of Defense, deterrence is "the prevention from action by fear of the consequences." 
83
Deterrence theory had many fathers, but some of the most prominent deserve mention. Albert Wohlstetter established his credentials when he wrote 
There are also schools of single-service strategies devoted to sea power or air power. In the sea power arena the most famous strategic theorists are Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian S. Corbett. American naval officer Mahan wrote several books and articles around the turn of the 20th century advocating sea power. Perhaps the most famous was The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783. Mahan developed a set of criteria that he believed facilitated sea power, but his major contribution was in the realm of the exercise of that capability through what he called "command of the sea." His study of history convinced Mahan that the powerful maritime nations had dominated history, and specifically, that England had parlayed its command of the sea into world dominance.
At the grand strategic level Mahan believed that countries with the proper prerequisites should pursue sea power (and especially naval power) as the key to prosperity.
To Mahan, oceans were highways of commerce. Navies existed to protect friendly commerce and interrupt that of their enemies. The way to do both was to gain command of the sea. 
85
British author Julian S. Corbett had a different interpretation of naval warfare. A contemporary of Mahan, Corbett saw British success not so much as a result of dominance of the sea, as from its ability to effectively wield what we call today all the elements of national power. Corbett differentiated between maritime power and strategy and naval power and strategy. Maritime strategy encompassed all the aspects of sea power-military, commercial, political, etc. Naval strategy dealt specifically with the actions and maneuvers of the fleet. Like Mahan, Corbett saw oceans as highways of commerce and understood their importance. However, he emphasized not the uniqueness of sea power but its relationship with other elements of power. For Corbett, the importance of navies was not their ability to gain command of the sea but their ability to affect events on land. He believed that navies rarely won wars on their own-they often made it possible for armies to do so. The navy's role was thus to protect the homeland while isolating and facilitating the insertion of ground forces into the overseas objective area. Neither command of the sea nor decisive naval battle were necessarily required to accomplish either of those tasks. Although Corbett admitted that winning the decisive naval clash remained the supreme function of a fleet, he believed there were times when that was neither necessary nor desirable. 
86
Another school of sea power was the Jeune Ecolé, which was popular on the continent in the early 1880s. Its primary advocate was Admiral Théophile Aube of the French Navy. Unlike the theories of either Mahan or Corbett, which were intended for major naval powers, the Jeune Ecolé was a classic small-navy strategy. It was a way for land powers to fight sea powers. Advocates claimed that a nation did not have to command the sea to use it. In fact, modern technology made gaining command of the sea impossible. And one certainly did not have to have a large fleet of capital ships or win a big fleet battle. Rather than capital ships, one could rely on torpedo boats and cruisers (later versions would emphasize submarines). The naval strategist could either use those smaller vessels against the enemy's fleet in specific situations, such as countering an amphibious invasion, or more commonly against his commerce (to deny him the value of commanding the sea). Either use could be decisive without the expense of building and maintaining a large fleet or the dangers inherent in a major naval battle. 
87
The basis of classic air power theory-although paternity is debatable-is The Command of the Air, published first in 1921 by Italian general and author Giulio Douhet. Reacting to the horrors he had seen in the First World War, Douhet became an advocate of air power. He believed that the airplane could restore decisiveness to warfare that ground combat seemed incapable of achieving. It could fly over the ground battlefield to directly attack the enemy's will. Because of technical problems with detection and interception, stopping an air raid would be impossible. Big bombers carrying a mix of high explosive, incendiary, and poison gas weapons could target enemy cities. Civilian populations, which were the key to modern warfare, would be unable to stand such bombardment and would soon force their governments to surrender. Although civilian casualties might be high, this would be a more humane method of warfare than prolonged ground combat.
There were a few strategic dicta beyond that. First, a prerequisite for success was command of the air-a theory closely related to command of the sea. Command of the air granted one side the ability to fly where and when it desired while the enemy was unable to fly. Next, because the airplane was an offensive weapon, one gained command of the air by strategic bombardmentideally catching the enemy's air force on the ground. Recognizing the technological limitations of his day, Douhet believed there was no need for anti-aircraft artillery or interceptors, since neither worked effectively. In fact, resources devoted to air defense or any type of auxiliary aircraft (anything that was not a large bomber) were wasted. The resource argument also featured shifting funding from the traditional land and sea services to the air service-a position not designed to win friends in the wider defense community. Like other airmen, Douhet believed that airplanes were best employed in an independent air force. 
88
Other Air Power Theories. Douhet may have been the father of air power theory, but others followed him quickly. Most of the later air power theorists worked on one or both of two primary issues that Douhet had first surfaced: the most efficient way to organize air power-a debate generally about an independent air force, or the proper mix of fighters, bombers, and ground-attack aircraft. The debate about separate air forces was important but not a true strategic issue. Conversely, the issue of proper mix of aircraft got directly to the issue of the proper role of air power. The early theorists presented a variety of views on the issue. William "Billy" Mitchell saw America's strategic problem as one of defense against sea-borne attack. A Douhet-like offensive air strategy was inappropriate. He also believed that aerial combat could provide effective defense against air attack. Thus, he developed a strategy based on a mix of fighters and bombers. In terms of both the necessity of command of the air and the potential strategic decisiveness of air power, Mitchell agreed completely with Douhet. 
89

Which of these approaches to strategy is the best? What is the approved solution? The answer is simple-there is no best solution. All the above have utility for specific purposes but are lacking as generalizations on strategy. They tend to be: 1) war-oriented rather than general (i.e., military strategy rather than strategy in general); 2) too narrowly focused even within the wartime realm (that is, they address military-specific strategies rather than more general grand strategies, and in some cases represent single-service approaches); and 3) even in the military arena are too focused on one aspect of a multidimensional problem (i.e., they attempt to skip the basic ends-ways-means relationship and go straight to the solution). They are generally concerned with the how, while ignoring the what or why. The exceptions were the broad concepts like attrition, exhaustion, and annihilation and nuclear strategy that always aimed at deterrence and clearly linked ways with means to achieve that end.
So, why present all these strategic concepts if they do not work? Remember that although none of the paradigms works as a generalization, each has merit in specific circumstances. The strategist needs to be familiar with each so he can select the best approach or combination of approaches for the situation he faces. In that respect strategy is much like carpentry. Both are skills intended for solving problems. The carpenter uses a saw to cut, a hammer to drive, sandpaper to smooth, and myriad other tools depending on the need-there is a tool for every job. Similarly, the strategist needs to have a wide assortment of tools in his kit bag and be able to select the proper one for the task at hand. There is an old saying that if the only tool one has is a hammer, all problems look like a nail. That is as bad a solution in strategy as it is in carpentry. Gregory D. Foster argued in a Washington Quarterly article that there is no official or accepted general theory of strategy in the United States. In fact, he notes that, as a people, Americans seem to regard theorizing in general as a futile intellectual exercise. If one were to construct such a theory, Foster continues, it should incorporate those elements found in any complete theory: essential terminology and definitions; an explanation of the assumptions and premises underlying the theory; substantive propositions translated into testable hypothesis; and methods that can be used to test the hypotheses and modify the theory as appropriate.

One sees the term "strategy" misapplied often. There is a tendency to use it as a general term for a plan, concept, course of action, or "idea" of a direction in which to proceed. Such use is inappropriate. Strategy is the domain of the senior leader at the higher echelons of the state, the military, business corporations, or other institutions. Henry Eccles describes strategy as "…the comprehensive direction of power to control situations and areas in order to attain objectives."

A third premise of a theory of strategy is that the strategy must identify an appropriate balance among the objectives sought, the methods to pursue the objectives, and the resources available. In formulating a strategy, the ends, ways, and means are part of an inteegral whole, and if one is discussing a strategy at the national (grand) level with a national level end, the ways and means would similarly refer to national level concepts and resources. That is, ends, ways, and means must be consistent. Thus, a National Security Strategy end could be supported by concepts based on all the instruments of power and the associated resources. For the military element of power, the National Military Strategy would identify appropriate ends for the military to be accomplished through national military concepts with national military resources. In a similar manner a Theater or Regional Combatant Commander would have specific theater level objectives for which he would develop theater concepts and use resources allocated to his theater. In some cases these might include other than military instruments of power if those resources are available. The levels of strategy are distinct, but interrelated because of the hierarchical and comprehensive nature of strategy.
A fourth premise of strategy is that political purpose must dominate all strategy; hence, Clausewitz's famous dictum, "War is merely the continuation of policy by other means." 8 Political purpose is stated in policy. Policy is the expression of the desired end state sought by the government.
In its finest form it is clear articulation of guidance for the employment of the instruments of power toward the attainment of one or more end states. In practice, policy tends to be much vaguer. Nonetheless policy dominates strategy by its articulation of the end state and its guidance. The analysis of the end state and guidance yields objectives leading to the desired end state. Objectives provide purpose, focus, and justification for the actions embodied in a strategy. 
9
A fifth premise is that strategy is hierarchical. Foster argues that true strategy is the purview of the leader and is a "weltanschauung" (world view) that represents both national consensus and comprehensive direction. In the cosmic scheme of things Foster may well be right, but reality requires more than a "weltanschauung." Political leadership ensures and maintains its control and influence through the hierarchical nature of state strategy. Strategy cascades from the national level down to the lower levels. Generally, strategy emerges at the top as a consequence of policy statements and a stated National Security Strategy (sometimes referred to as Grand Strategy). National Security Strategy lays out broad objectives and direction for the use of all the instruments of power. From this National Security Strategy the major activities and departments develop subordinate strategies. For the military, this is the National Military Strategy. In turn, the National Military Strategy leads to lower strategies appropriate to the various levels of war.
The U.S. Army War College (in consonance with Joint Pub 1-02) defines the levels of strategy within the state as:
• National Security Strategy. (also referred to as Grand Strategy and National Strategy). The art and science of developing, applying and coordinating the instruments of national power (diplomatic, economic, military, and informational) to achieve objectives that contribute to national security (Joint Pub 1-02).
• National Military Strategy. The art and science of distributing and applying military power to attain national objectives in peace and war (Joint Pub 1-02).
• Theater Strategy. The art and science of developing integrated strategic concepts and courses of action directed toward securing the objectives of national and alliance or coalition security policy and strategy by the use of force, threatened use of force, or operations not involving the use of force within a theater (Joint Pub 1-02).
The hierarchical nature of strategy facilitates span of control. It represents a logical means of delegating responsibility and authority among senior leadership. It also suggests that if strategy consists of objectives, concepts, and resources, each should be appropriate to the level of strategy and consistent with one another. Thus, strategy at the national military level should articulate military objectives at the national level and express the concepts and resources in terms appropriate to the national level for the specified objective.
At some level planning and action fall below the strategic threshold. Under the National Military Strategy, the Combatant Commanders develop Theater Strategy and subsequent campaign plans. At this juncture the line between strategy and planning merges with campaign planning that may be either at the theater strategic level or in the realm of Operational Art. Graphically the relationship between strategy and the levels of war appear as: 10 Strategy differs from operational art and tactics in functional, temporal, and geographic aspects. Functionally and temporally, tactics is the domain of battles-engagements of relative short duration. Operational art is the domain of the campaign, a series of battles occurring over a longer period of time. Strategy is the domain of war that encompasses the protracted level of conflict among nations, armed or unarmed. Tactics concerns itself with the parts or pieces, operational art with the combination of the pieces, and strategy with the combinations of combinations. Geographically, tactics is narrowly defined; operational level is broader and more regional in orientation; and, strategy is theater-wide, intercontinental, or global. It should also be noted that with the advances in transportation and communications, there has been a spatial and temporal convergence of strategy, operational art, and tactics. Increasingly, events at the tactical level have strategic consequences. 
1
A seventh premise is that strategy is developed from a thorough analysis and knowledge of the strategic situation/environment. The purpose of this analysis is to highlight the internal and external factors that help define or may affect the specific objectives, concepts, and resources of strategy.
The last premise of a theory of strategy is that some risk is inherent to all strategy, and the best any strategy can offer is a favorable balance against failure. Failure can be either the failure to achieve one's own objectives and/or providing a significant advantage to one's adversaries.
Art Lykke gave coherent form to a theory of strategy with his articulation of the three-legged stool model of strategy, which illustrated that strategy = ends + ways + means and, if these were not in balance, the assumption of greater risk. In the Lykke proposition (model) the ends are "objectives," the ways are the "concepts" for accomplishing the objectives, and the means are the "resources" for supporting the con-
Domestic and international circumstances and conditions affecting the welfare of the state.  cepts. The stool tilts if the three legs are not kept in balance. If any leg is too short, the risk is too great and the strategy falls over. 
12
13
Art Lykke wrestled with his proposition for many years and taught thousands of Army War College students to use his model properly through definition and illustration. These definitions and illustrations are important because they provide the common understanding by which strategists communicate. They include:
• Ends (objectives) explain "what" is to be accomplished. Ends are objectives that, if accomplished, create, or contribute to, the achievement of the desired end state at the level of strategy being analyzed and, ultimately, serve national interests. Ends are expressed with verbs (i.e., deter war, promote regional stability, destroy Iraqi armed forces).
• Ways (strategic concepts/courses of action) explain "how" the ends are to be accomplished by the employment of resources. The concept must be explicit enough to provide planning guidance to those who must implement and resource it. Since ways convey action they often have a verb, but ways are statements of "how," not "what" in relation to the objective of a strategy. Some confusion exists, because the concept for higher strategy often defines the objectives of the next lower level of strategy. A simple test for a way is to ask "in order to do what?" That should lead to the real objective. Some concepts are so accepted that their names have been given to specific strategies (containment, forward defense, assured destruction, and forward presence are illustrations). But note that in actual practice these strategies have specific objectives and forces associated with them, and the concept is better developed than the short title suggests.
• Means (resources) explain what specific resources are to be used in applying the concepts to accomplish the objectives and use no verb. Means can be tangible or intangible. Examples of tangible means include forces, people, equipment, money, and facilities. Intangible resources include things like "will," courage, or intellect.
• Risk explains the gap between what is to be achieved and the concepts and resources available to achieve the objective. Since there are never enough resources or a clever enough concept to assure 100 percent success in the competitive international environment, there is always some risk. The strategist seeks to minimize this risk through his development of the strategy-the balance of ends, ways, and means.
Ends, ways, and means often get confusing in the development or analysis of a specific strategy. The trick is to focus on the questions. Objectives will always answer the question of what one is trying to achieve. Concepts always explain "how" the resources will be used. Resources always explain what will be used to execute the concept. If the objective is "defend the United States (what?)"; "to develop, build, or establish a larger force" is a way (how?); and, "national man-power reserves, money, and training facilities" are examples of the means (resources to be used to support the "how"). The rule of thumb to apply here is that resources are usually physical and countable: Army, Air Force, Navy, units and armed forces of United States; personnel; dollars; facilities; equipment-trucks, planes, ships, etc.; and resources of organizations-Red Cross, NATO, etc. Means might also include such intangibles as "will, industrial capacity, intellect. etc.," but, state them as resources. Do not use means to describe concepts, and do not articulate resources as ways or concepts. In a very simplified manner, "diplomacy" is a way to promote regional stability (objective), but diplomats are the means. In the same manner, Clausewitz preferred "overthrow of the enemy's government" as the end, to fight a decisive battle as the way, and a larger army as the means. He saw the larger army as an appropriate resource to support his way-the decisive battle. To say "use of a larger army" infers a different concept for success and is an inappropriate statement of means (resources).
Over time thousands of students at the Army War College have tested Art Lykke's theory of strategy using the historical case study approach. His proposition is a common model for analyzing and evaluating the strategy of historical and current strategic level leadership. By using the theory to break a strategy into its component parts, Art Lykke argued that any strategy can be examined for suitability, feasibility, and acceptability, and, an assessment made of the proper balance among the component parts. In addition, his lecturing and presentations have led to the adoption of the basic model by a cohort of military and political strategists. This has, in turn, led to the proactive evaluation of strategy during development against the same standards of:
• Suitability-will its attainment accomplish the effect desired (relates to objective)?
• Feasibility-can the action be accomplished by the means available (relates to concept)?
• Acceptability-are the consequences of cost justified by the importance of the effect desired (relates to resources/concept)?

1. Gregory D. Foster, "A Conceptual Foundation for a Theory of Strategy," The Washington Quarterly, Winter 1990, p. 43. Foster's analysis of the assumptions and premises of strategy is particularly thought provoking.
Strategy is best understood as the art and science of developing and using the political, economic, socio-psychological, and military powers of the state in accordance with policy guidance to create effects that protect or advance the state's interests in the strategic environment. The strategic environment is the realm in which the national leadership interacts with other states or actors and the possibilities of the future to advance the well-being of the state. It is inclusive, consisting of the facts, context, conditions, relationships, trends, issues, threats, opportunities, and interactions that influence the success of the state in relation to the physical world, other states and actors, chance, and the possible futures-all effects or other factors that potentially affect the well-being of the state and the way the state pursues its well-being. As a self-organizing complex system (a system of systems), the strategic environment is a dynamic environment that reacts to input but not necessarily in a direct cause-and-effect manner. Strategy is how the state exerts purposeful influence over this environment. Thus, strategy is a disciplined thought process that seeks to apply a degree of rationality and linearity to an environment that may or may not be either, so that effective planning can be accomplished. Strategy does this by identifying strategic ends (objectives), ways (concepts) and means (resources) that, when accomplished, lead to favorable effects in regard to the state's well-being. 
1
The purpose of the strategic appraisal is to quantify and qualify what is known, believed to be known and unknown about the strategic environment in regard to a particular realm of strategy and identify what is important with regard to such strategy's formulation. It represents a rational, scientific approach to acquiring what Carl von Clausewitz referred to as coup d'oeil-the ability to see what is really important.

The levels and kinds of strategy fall in different realms. Realms reflect both the hierarchical nature of strategy and its comprehensiveness, thereby allowing the state's leadership to delegate responsibility for strategy at different levels and in different domains while maintaining control over a complex process. The strategic appraisal focuses on serving that realm of strategy undertaken-both the kind and level. For example, the term "Grand Strategy" encompasses both level and kind, implying an overarching strategy that integrates the use of all the state's power in service of all the state's interests. National strategies are at the national level, but they may apply to all elements of power and the associated departments and agencies as the National Security Strategy does, or they may focus on one element, as is the case with the National Military Strategy. Strategies may also have a regional focus, a force developmental focus, an organizational focus, and other foci as illustrated in Figure 
4-2
Strategist's Weltanschauung  Thinking about the kind and level of strategy helps develop specificity in the articulation of interests and better focuses the strategy with regard to the desired end states. It also clarifies and assigns responsibility, authority, and accountability. Nonetheless, the strategist at every level and in every domain must still maintain a holistic perspective.
Determining and articulating interests is the second step in the strategic appraisal process. The DOD Dictionary of Military Terms defines national security interests as: "The foundation for the development of valid national objectives that define U.S. goals or purposes. National security interests include preserving U.S. political identity, framework, and institutions; fostering economic well-being; and bolstering international order supporting the vital interests of the United States and its allies."

Interests are founded in national purpose. National purpose is essentially a summary of our enduring values, beliefs, and ethics as expressed by political leadership with regard to the present and the future they foresee. At the highest level, political leadership uses policy to identify state interests and provide guidance for subordinate policy and strategy. Such policy may appear as general as a vision statement that proclaims a desired future strategic environment, or as a more specific statement of guidance-with elements of ends, ways, and means. It is found in various documents, speeches, policy statements, and other pronouncements made on behalf of the government by various officials, or it may be provided by leadership as direct guidance for the development of specific strategy. Policy may be inferred as well as stated. It may be the result of a detailed strategic appraisal or arrived at intuitively. Regardless, state policy flows from the formal and informal political processes and the interpretation of the national purpose in the current and desired future strategic environments. Thus, national interests are the general or specific statements of the nation's desired end states within the strategic environment based on the policymakers' understanding of what best serves national well-being.
Interests may be expressed as physical or non-physical conditions. They may represent continuities or changes-things to be protected, things to be promoted, or things to be created. Ideally, interests flow logically from the policy formulation process, but the nature of the political and bureaucratic environments, particularly in a democracy, can make identifying and clearly articulating interests and their relative importance or intensity a difficult task. As stated above, in the real world policy appears in many formats, often is not clearly stated, and may not be comprehensive in its statement of interests and guidance for serving interests. Policy may also come from multiple and contradictory sources, such as the executive or legislative branches, and it may be emerging from the interagency process at the time a strategy is demanded. While strategy is subordinate to policy, the strategist must search out and clarify policy intentions and appropriately identify and articulate interests. In cases where policy intentions or interests statements conflict with the reality of the strategic environment and clarification is appropriate, the strategist provides appropriate recommendations to the approval authority.
Theorists have proposed various methodologies for determining interests and levels of intensity. Sometimes, presidential administrations impose their own methodologies to express categories of interests and their associate levels of intensity. In recent years, course material at the Senior Service Colleges, such as the U.S. Army War College, has focused on three that are termed core U.S. interests: physical security, promotion of values, and economic prosperity. In the Army War College process model these three interests lead directly to three grand strategic objectives: preserve American security, bolster American economic prosperity, and promote American values.

Interests as statements of desired end states do not imply intended actions or set objectivespolicy guidance and strategy does that. Consequently, interests are stated without verbs or other action modifiers. As argued above, interests are expressed with an appropriate degree of specificity. For example, "access to oil" is an expression of a desired end state, but is very general. It could apply anywhere in the world. "Access to oil in the Middle East" is a regionally stated interest, focusing strategic efforts on a specific region; however, it still allows the use of various elements of power and a wide range of objectives and concepts. "Freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf" as an expression of a specifically stated interest in the CENTCOM theater military strategy gives an even narrower focus to the desired end state and emphasizes the military instrument. Hence, statements of interests in strategies achieve specificity by word choice, directing the focus and narrowing the context. Expression of interests, like most things in strategy, remains a matter of choice, but the strategist should be aware of the fact he is making a choice and the potential implications of word selection-a matter worthy of deliberation and discussion! Therefore, strategists often achieve the right degree of specificity through an iterative process in which they articulate an interest and then restate it as they learn more about the implications of pursuing that interest.
Specificity in interests serves the multiple purposes of clarifying the intent of policy in different realms, focusing attention on the appropriate strategic factors, enabling better strategy formulation, and helping to identify responsibility, authority, and accountability. For example, a military strategy would logically, but not exclusively, focus on end states that could be accomplished through the application of the military element of power. Not exclusively so, because as Nuechterlein observed, interests tend to bleed over into other categories, and the military instrument may also facilitate accomplishment of diplomatic, economic, or informational focused interests. In a similar manner, other instruments of power may play crucial roles in support of military strategies.
Having determined and articulated the interests, the third step in the strategic appraisal is to determine the level of intensity of each interest. Different methodologies and models have also guided the determination and expression of levels of intensity. Both Nuechterlein and Army War College methodologies advocate applying levels of intensity to interests to indicate criticality and priority. Levels of intensity at the Army War College include: Vital, Important, and Peripheral. 
8

Levels of intensity indicate criticality and priority of interests with regard to the well-being of the state. They help the strategist understand the relative importance and urgency among interests, but do not imply that any should not be considered or addressed in some manner-all interests are worthy of some level of concern. Levels of intensity suggest relative importance and have temporal, resource, and risk-acceptance implications, but the decision to act or how to act with regard to them flows from the whole of the strategy formulation process-not the assignment of the intensity. Intensity levels are transitory in that they are subject to change based on the perception of urgency associated with them at any time. Intensity is dependent on the context of the strategic situation and the policy maker or strategist's interpretation of the context and the importance of the interest to national well-being. The definitions of the four intensity levels of Survival, Vital, Important, and Peripheral are provided in Figure

The determination of the key strategic factors and the strategist's choices with regard to them is one of the most poorly understood aspects of strategy formulation. It represents a major shortcoming in theoretical consideration of a strategic mindset. Clausewitz's use of coup d'oeil describes this aspect. He argues "the concept merely refers to the quick recognition of a truth that the mind would ordinarily miss or would perceive only after long study and reflection." 
12
13
Survival -If unfulfilled, will result in immediate massive destruction of one or more major aspects of the core national interests.
Vital -If unfulfilled, will have immediate consequence for core national interests.
Important -If unfulfilled, will result in damage that will eventually affect core national interests.
Peripheral -If unfulfilled, will result in damage that is unlikely to affect core national interests. Seeing what is really important flows from a thorough assessment of the realities and possibilities of the strategic environment-tempered by an understanding of its nature and strategic theory. Strategy in its essence is about creating a more "favorable future" for the state than might exist if left to chance or the actions of adversaries and others. It is proactive, but not predictive. Thus, in dealing with the unknowns and uncertainties of the future, the strategist forecasts from a knowledge and understanding of the systems of the strategic environment-what they are (facts and assumptions) and how they interact (observation, reason and assumptions) within the various dimensions of interaction. He considers these in terms of continuities and change-thinking in time streams to see how the present can be affected by change and how continuities of the past and changes today may play out in the future. From this assessment the strategist derives the strategic factors-the things that can potentially contribute to or detract causally from the realization of the interest. Factors may be tangible or intangible, representing any aspect of the environment. The existence of other states and actors, geography, culture, history, relationships, perspectives, perceptions, facts, and assumptions all represent potential factors that must be considered in the strategic appraisal. What the strategist understands they are, and what others believe them to be, are both important.
Having identified strategic factors, the strategist continues his assessment to determine which are the key strategic factors-those critical factors at the crux of interaction within the strategic environment, representing the potential critical points of tension between continuities and change in the system of systems where the strategist may choose to act or must act to realize the interest. In strategy formulation these critical strategic factors are the "keys" to developing an effective strategy, because using, influencing, and countering them is how the strategist creates strategic effects and advances or protects interests. The strategist seeks to change, leverage, or overcome these, in effect modifying or retaining the equilibrium in the strategic environment by setting objectives and developing concepts and marshaling resources to achieve the objectives. When successfully selected and achieved, the objectives create strategic effects that tip the balance in favor of the stated interests. The strategist's assessment of how to best do this is reflected in his calculation of the relationship of ends, ways, and means-the rationally stated output of strategic thought. The calculation and each of its components are based on the strategist's assessment of the relationship between the desired end state and various key factors. It is the appraisal of the strategic environment and selection of the key strategic factors that sets up the calculation.
Hence, the biggest conundrum confronting the strategist in strategy formulation is identifying the key strategic factors. By definition, the strategic environment is big, and there is a lot of information and VUCA in it-the conundrum is to determine what is really important in an over-

whelming amount of information and possibilities. How do we determine strategic factors? How does the strategist achieve the focus that enables him to disregard the unimportant and not overlook something critical? Of the strategic factors, how does the strategist choose those that are key and should be addressed by strategy? How do key strategic factors lead to the rational expression of strategic thinking as ends, ways, and means? The thought processes to answer these questions are the heart of the strategic appraisal. Models and insights offered by theorists and practitioners provide guides to assist and discipline the appraisal process, but it starts with an open mind that seeks inclusive answers to broad questions. From there the strategist applies strategic thinking competencies to narrow the focus through a successive series of questions and answers that lead to the distillation of the key factors. Factors are defined as pertinent facts, trends, threats, conditions, or inferences that imply an effect on the realization of the interest. Thus, factors are not accumulations of information or statements of simple facts. And their scope exceeds that of "facts bearing on the problem" in the problem-solving staff study because they are concerned with what has occurred in the past, what might occur in the future, and multi-ordered effects of any changes. Factors are distinguished from information by the strategist's assessment of their potential causal relationship with the interest. While some may have a visible direct cause-and-effect relationship, many will be less obvious, and their importance lies in their second, third, or further multi-ordered implications with regard to the interest.
Consequently, factors are stated to show their bearing on the interest. For example, if the stated national interest is "a stable, peaceful China," the fact the Great Wall is 4,000 miles long is interesting, but it is only information and not a factor with regard to the interest, because the Wall no longer plays a part in China's internal stability or defense. It is also a fact that the population of China is in excess of 1.3 billion. One could argue that it is a strategic factor because the sheer magnitude of the numbers involved has implications for the stated interest. However, in and of itself, the fact is of little help to the strategist other than no strategy with regard to China could ignore the inferences of such a large population. As stated, the fact has no real context with regard to the interest. A population-related fact better expressed as a factor potentially affecting the stability interest is: "The Chinese government is struggling to sustain adequate job growth for tens of millions of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises, migrants, and new entrants to the work force." 
14
15
16
Determining strategic factors is difficult, and ultimately, like most aspects of strategy, the selection of key strategic factors is a matter of choice by the strategist. Sorting through the VUCA of the strategic environment in search of what is really important requires the strategist to approach the appraisal from multiple perspectives using his understanding of strategic theory and applying all the strategic thinking competencies. Such strategic thinking competencies act as lenses to assist the strategist with an evaluation of the strategic environment, reminding the strategist of the dimensions of the intellect that should be applied to seek and sort information and to recognize which factors are key.

Richard E. Neustadt and Ernest R. May in Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision Makers also place emphasis on determining all the factors and selecting the key factors as a basis for decision making. While their focus is on issue policy, and the terminology does not use the word "factor," their first step in asking for the identification of key elements that are known, unclear, and presumed is obviously focused on determining factors. One insightful approach that decisionmakers can use is to identify multiple past situations that appear analogous and list similarities and differences. Again, this process logically leads to identifying not only what is known and important in the current situation, but leverages history to get insights into potentially unrecognized factors and relationships among factors. Neustadt and May's concept of "thinking in time" connects discrete phenomena over time and is able to relate the connections to potential futures and choices for a desired future-hence this thinking process identifies factors that matter in a strategy seeking a more favorable future. 
20
Other strategic thinking competencies also offer insights into how to think of and identify strategic factors. Systems thinking focuses on comprehending the whole, but the process identifies systems, interdependence among systems, individual aspects of particular systems with regard to their roles or functions within the whole, and the effects of any changes induced on the whole. 
21
22
23
Structural analysis models can also assist in sorting what is important in the vast information available, and thus, lead to the identification of the key strategic factors. One simple structure to use is to look at the information from the perspective of the elements of power. Facts or trends that indicate or affect balance and relationships in power are potential strategic factors. Hence, focusing on the natural and social determinants of power of the various actors serves as a filter for sorting through the overwhelming volume of information to see what is important. The elements of power are listed below.
Social Determinants
Such a filter works because there are casual and interdependence relationships among interests, power, and strategy that become apparent under disciplined consideration. Power is relative, dynamic, and contextual, and the examination and weighing of information with regard to power reveals relevant factors and suggests which are key. 
24
Since the strategic environment is a system of systems, and the people and other human entities depicted below are part of the interaction, an actor structural analysis is another way to filter information to see what is really important with regard to specific interests. Individual personali-ties and collective mentalities matter in the pursuit of interests. Here the strategist poses broad questions such as: who is affected by this interest and how; who else shares or opposes this interest and why; how will others act or react with regard to this interest and how and why; and what influences others' actions with regard to this interest and why? Answers to these questions reveal factors that must be considered.
Since factors relate strategy to the interests and a proper focus of strategy is interaction, the dimensions of interaction in the strategic environment are another important information filter. In this construct, the strategist uses the dimensions as lenses to focus attention on what is important among the profusion of information. These dimensions are in play to a greater or lesser extent at all times. Colin S. Gray identifies some 17 strategic dimensions as depicted below, but acknowledges there may be many more. The strategist must consider factors derived from analysis using these dimensions both individually and holistically-that is each distinctly but at the same time in context with each other. Since particular dimensions play a greater role or are more critical at particular times in history, the strategist must be attuned to this potential and the fact that none of the dimensions can be ignored over time. A dimension of strategy approach is a valid methodology for identifying what is important with regard to an interest because it allows the question: "What is important relative to this interest in this dimension and how does it interact with the whole of the environment?"  From his assessment and synthesis of the information, the strategist determines the relevant factors-facts, issues, assumptions, presumptions, threats and opportunities-that act or interact to affect the interest. These factors are written as simple factual statements in a manner that makes clear how they affect, and if they assist or hinder U.S. interests. From this broad understanding and list of factors, the strategist develops a refined list of key strategic factors by asking a new series of questions.
What can most likely detract from or preclude the realization of the interest? What best supports or can be leveraged to realize the interest? What does policy guidance allow or preclude? What assumptions are inherent to my understanding of the situation and realization of the interests? Can these assumptions be made factual? What changes in facts or assumptions would affect the realization of interests and how? What role does chance play-are there wild cards? These questions lead to the selection of the key strategic factors-the factors the strategy must account for or that the strategist thinks provides the key to successful pursuit of the interest.
The strategist is now poised to formulate a specific strategy. Using the strategic appraisal framework he has applied to strategic thinking competencies and various models to clarify interests and levels of intensity, the strategist has culled out strategic factors relevant to the realization of the interests from an overabundance of information, and he has further refined this broad list of factors into a more focused list of key strategic factors on which to base a strategy. However, the strategic appraisal framework has done much more than this. It has immersed the strategist in the strategic environment from the perspective of specific national interests. It has identified what is important relative to those interests, forced the strategist to distinguish between fact and assumption, and alerted him to the consequences of change. Thus, the framework focuses the strategy formulation process on the key strategic factors, suggesting where flexibility is needed and how strategy might be made adaptive. Further, it provides indicators for potential future issues and prepares the strategist for considering changes in strategy.
Once the strategic appraisal is complete, the strategist uses his understanding of the key strategic factors to influence the strategic environment favorably without inadvertently creating other unfavorable effects. These factors suggest suitable objectives, suggest or limit concepts, and identify appropriate resources. In addition, the key strategic factors both suggest and bound what is feasible, acceptable, and suitable in strategy formulation. The assessment of the factors also provides the basis for the consideration of risk in a strategy. Through his formulation of appropriate ends, ways, and means to leverage and account for these factors, the strategist creates favorable strategic effects leading to the realization of the interest. Which factors to act upon, what objectives to set to create favorable strategic effects, what concepts to use to achieve those objectives without adverse effects, and what resources to provide to implement the concepts are all choices made in strategy formulation from the knowledge gained in the strategic appraisal. To the extent this is done well, the strategist creates more favorable effects and brings the strategy closer to the realization of the interest.
The strategic appraisal framework serves to discipline the strategist's thought process and codify its output. Like all theory, it educates but does not dictate-the human mind must make the choices. Yet, through education, the appraisal framework leads to potentially better appraisals and a more careful consideration of what the interests are and the factors to be considered with regard to them. Through codification, it allows critical review and a shared understanding of how a strategy is expected to work. As such, the framework is a useful tool, but a healthy weltanschauung is essential to retain the proper perspective on the validity of a strategy and to recognize when and whether modification or a new strategy is necessary. Theory can aid the practice of strategic coup d'oeil and strategy formulation by offering a framework for identifying and considering the relevant factors, but the strategist's choice of what to do, how to do it, and the resources to be made available remain a creation of the active intellect.
In a tactical situation one is able to see at least half the problem with the naked eye, whereas in strategy everything has to be guessed at and presumed.

The hierarchical chart of the Army War College strategy formulation model at Appendix II shows a final block labeled "Risk Assessment." The implication of the diagram is that risk assessment is the final step in the strategy formulation process and is a discreet action. However, policy and strategy, properly arrived at, demand a continuous and thorough assessment and reassessment of risk throughout the total process.
Strategists and strategic theorists throughout history have grappled with the concept of risk and methodologies for its assessment. The motivation to eliminate uncertainty in policy and strategy development as well as execution is natural, if at times chimerical. There will always be uncertainty. It often will be unmeasurable. The very nature of war and conflict and the increasingly complex strategic environment ensures that this is so. Where then does this leave the aspiring student of strategy? Is risk assessment simply the "comfort level that senior planners experience as they assess key variables?" 2 It is this and more. The concept of risk assessment is worth examining in more detail to put some substance to the form.
Defining risk is a relatively simple task. John Collins, in his primer on grand strategy, reduces it to its essentials: "Discrepancies between ends, which we have identified as interests and objectives, and means-available resources-create risks, which can rarely be quantified." 
3
4
The first difficulty is with understanding what Clausewitz and others meant by "means" in the ends-means equation. Current use of the term generally accepts that means constitute resources; that is, personnel, treasure, equipment, political will, time, and so on. Clausewitz also intended a larger meaning that includes concepts or courses of action (what we term "ways") to achieve particular objectives; these coupled with resources constitute the means or "effort to be made." 
6
Art Lykke makes the case for this approach in presenting his well-taught model comprising three variables: ends (objectives), ways (concepts, options or courses of action for achieving them), and means (resources). Using a simple metaphor of a three legged stool, he points out that if the ends, ways and means (the legs of the stool) are not of equal length, then we are left with a stool (and a strategy) that is out of balance. Continuing the analogy, he defines this angle of imbalance as risk. The greater the mismatch between ends, ways and/or means, the greater the risk of achieving ones objectives. 
7
8
Thus, the definition of risk is the degree to which strategic objectives, concepts, and resources are in or out of balance. Since strategy is a dynamic process, one must understand that all three elements are variable and subject to change over time and circumstance. The formulation of effective strategy for any endeavor is a constant quest to ensure balance among the variables. The definition applies to all aspects of strategy development, whether dealing with national security (grand) strategy, defense, military or theater strategies, business strategy, or even personal strategies.
The subtitle is borrowed from David Jablonsky's piece, "Why is Strategy Difficult?" 9 (See Chapter 1 in this volume). The very nature of war and conflict presupposes a relationship between thinking adversaries. This, in turn, ensures that a degree of ambiguity, uncertainty and yes, risk will exist in any developed strategy. Indeed, Clausewitz devotes the central theme of On War to this very premise; that is what distinguishes his work from his predecessors and ensures its continued relevance to the present day. Clausewitz was not the only one to recognize the subjective nature of war, but he was the first to mark that characteristic as preeminent. Throughout his work, there are allusions to "chance," "luck," "guesswork," "uncertainty," "probabilities," and so on. The search for hard truths is a frustrating one. This in itself is a lesson. The analogies and metaphors the Prussian philosopher provides to help understand the nature of war are not based on chess, but reflect "a duel on a larger scale," "a pair of wrestlers," "commerce," a "collision of living forces," or a "game of chance." Formulating strategy presupposes "an animate object that reacts," and moreover, reacts unpredictably. This equates to André Beufre's definition of strategy as the "art of the dialectic of two opposing wills using force to solve their dispute." 
10
Moreover, ambiguity and uncertainty increase as one climbs up the strategic ladder as moral factors gain primacy over material ones. 
11

14
Despite this uncertainty, there is comfort in the knowledge that others have navigated these waters before. The challenge is to somehow structure or frame the strategic problem to minimize the unknown or, more importantly, to account for it. The effective strategist strives for the "closest approximation of the truth," knowing that full knowledge is an impossibility. 
15
If the mind is to emerge unscathed from this relentless struggle with the unforeseen, two qualities are indispensable: first, an intellect that, even in the darkest hour, retains some glimmerings of the inner light which leads to truth; and second, the courage to follow this faint light wherever it may lead (emphasis in the original). 
16
17
Von Moltke the Elder took up the same theme several generations later:
What is necessary is to discover the situation, such as it is, in spite of its being surrounded by the fog of the unknown; then to appreciate soundly what is seen, to guess what is not seen, to take a decision quickly, finally to act with vigour, without hesitation 
18
Acknowledging the theoretical uncertainties inherent in war, conflict and policy, and strategy development is an important, if unsatisfying, step in understanding risk assessment. It allows a better framing of the strategic puzzle. It is simply a matter of knowing what is not known in order to make better use of what is known and, as von Moltke suggests, to guess what is not seen. Guessing well is an inherent part of the art of Grand Strategy.
The essence of the challenge of strategy in general and risk assessment in particular is the core problem of relating ends to ways and means. Compounding this basic conundrum is the fact that most often the ends will be abstract while the ways and means will be relatively well defined. 
19
Any ambiguity in the ends-means relationship, any loss in the value roots of policy, or any failure to maintain a firm commitment to the achievement of the national purpose cannot help but deprive a foreign policy of essential meaning and effectiveness.

The simple definition of risk as an imbalance in ends, ways and/or means is straightforward but clearly incomplete. How does one measure the degree of risk in any particular strategic endeavor? This is the heart of the dilemma.
Risk assessment is inherent to the entire strategy formulation process. Donald Neuchterlein addresses risk in his discussion on identifying national interests and their intensities, a fundamental prerequisite to policy and strategy development. He posits sixteen criteria for assessing a particular issue as a vital interest. 
26
[i]t provides for systematic analysis of specific foreign policy issues; it should therefore lead to better judgments about levels of interest for the United States and its antagonists and, one would hope, to wiser policies than would otherwise be the case. 
27
The noted naval theorist, Admiral J.C. Wylie, took a more rigorous approach to the problem in a tongue-in-cheek article published in 1953 entitled "The Calculation of Risk." 
28
29
If P x S < Cf (1-S) then "no go"
These equations describe what is already known instinctively: If the payoff times the probability of success is greater than the cost of failure times the probability of failure, the result is a winning strategy.
Risk is further defined by an equation:
That is, the cost of a failed attempt over the cost of a successful attempt must be less than the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.
Having had his fun with the reader, Wylie further stipulates that "To insure success in its use, there is only one condition that must be met: the factors involved must never be expressed in arithmetic quantities. That would blunt the fine edge of judgment and obscure the true balance of intangibles." Wylie clearly subscribes to the Clausewitzian notions of uncertainty and unpredictability in war; he makes this clear in his important and short book, Military Strategy: A General Theory of Power Control. In it he further admonishes the reader to plan for a complete spectrum of strategies in order to have a "reserve" of strategies for the inevitable changes that will occur. Wylie also warns that "the player who plans for only one strategy runs a great risk simply because his opponent soon detects the single strategy-and counters it…planning for certitude is the greatest of all military mistakes…"

The process of risk assessment is dynamic in nature over time and circumstance. That is, the variables are in constant flux. Risk assessment is simply the constant effort to identify and correct imbalances among the key variables. The first ability of the strategist is to recognize when variables change. The second is to adjust the remaining variables to account for the "delta" or, as it has been defined, the risk. This is known as risk management. In simplest terms, the strategist has several clear options:

André Beaufre addresses the "ends-means" conundrum in his classic book Introduction to Strategy. His intent is to provide a series of models, what he calls patterns of strategy, to assist in the process of strategic thinking. 
39
Ends Moderate, Means Large. This is described as a strategy of "direct threat"; nuclear deterrence strategy is given as example of this pattern.
Ends Moderate, Means Limited. Consisting of a pattern of "indirect pressure," this pattern is useful when freedom of action is limited. It emphasizes political, diplomatic, and economic elements of power at the expense of direct military action. It models the basis of Soviet strategy during the Cold War; that is, avoiding direct military confrontation with the United States.
Ends Important, Ways Limited (Low Freedom of Action), Means Limited. This pattern constitutes a combination of "direct threat" and "indirect pressure" applied in successive actions and reflects the strategy of indirect approach as described by Liddell  Intended as examples, achieving strategic balance and hence strategic effectiveness may require application of one, more, or other creative elements to induce change in the strategic equation.
There do exist detailed and rigorously institutionalized processes for measuring risk within the U.S. defense establishment. The roots of these processes spring from the era of McNamara and the introduction of systems analysis to defense planning. In general, these methodologies represent an attempt to account institutionally for the unknown and help to "guess well." For example, as part of the Joint Strategy Review Process, a number of products result "that inform the Chairman's advice development and directive activities."

Assessing and managing strategic risk is an inherently inexact process. It encompasses a combination of inputs, both material and moral, that defy empirical resolution. Weighing these inputs, identifying possible outcomes, and planning for uncertainty should be done with the clear understanding that a complete solution is impossible to achieve but always striven for. Once a strategy is developed, the most important strategic skill and the true mark of strategic "genius" is accounting for potential change and recognizing actual change in a timely enough manner to adjust the strategic variables and thereby ensure a valid strategic equation oriented firmly on achieving the political objectives at hand. This is increasingly difficult to do in a dynamically changing strategic environment with myriad conventional and unconventional threats, challenges, actors, and unclear potential effects. This is why the development and execution of strategy is primarily an art and why the requirement for developing masters of that art is so essential. As Colin Gray notes, "In historical practice, uncertainty, chance and risk assuredly attend war and warfare, but they are simply conditions under which strategically educated leaders must labor."

The very nature of war is the single most steadfast element of continuity. Broadly described (not defined), war is a violent interactive contest between at least two groups of thinking human opponents acting simultaneously and in ignorance (to varying degrees) of the plans, actions, intentions, and even motives or goals of their opponent. Each is trying to impose his will on the other, and each is free to use whatever ways or means he can imagine or muster, bounded only by the limits of his own cultural or ethical framework, those "rules" or traditions he is willing to accept, and the realities of science and production. This was true of the first war, and it is true today.
Specific elements of war's general nature are equally unchanging. War must involve violence. Conflict without violence-physical violence, not emotional violence, virtual violence, or even the threat of violence-is not war. Making somebody feel awful (emotional violence) may be grounds for divorce, but it is not war. Virtual violence refers to the assault of electrons on electrons-in common parlance, hacking, although that term downplays significantly both the sophistication of the potential assaults and the magnitude of the potential results. Some claim attacks on national computer systems that control air traffic, significant economic activity, power grids, or other vital functions are acts of war. That may be so-the decision is a policy issue, and can go either waybut the act itself is not war and becomes war only if somebody decides to employ physical violence in retaliation, prevention, or anticipation of a cyber attack. The day-to-day exchange of hacking assaults that goes on around the world among private individuals, corporations, and countries may be intense and high-stake, but it is not war, at least in part because it involves no physical violence. For example, many analysts portrayed the recent denial of service attacks on PayPal and credit card companies in support of Wikileaks as modern acts of civil disobedience-nobody characterized them as war or even acts of war. Similarly, removing the threat of force from consideration in a discussion of the nature of war goes against many conventional modern definitions/understandings of war. However, the threat of violence is a normal diplomatic tool-like war, it is a continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means. Should, and only if, violence actually follows the threat does war exist. Threatening war with all its implications for deterrence and coercion is a valid use of military power, but not every use of military power is war. On a scale of potential political maneuvers, threats of force still fall within the realm of diplomacy; it is analogous to threatening to impose sanctions or an embargo-potentially useful, but completely different from actually carrying out the threat.
There are various words for forceful interaction without physical violence, the best of which is probably competition. Competition is a part of life and a normal condition for states; however, not all competition is war, and any definition of war that includes nonviolent forms of competition makes the concept of war indistinguishable from competition, and thus meaningless. The expressions "trade war" or "war on poverty" use a different and distinct definition of war that simply implies use of maximum effort to achieve an objective. 
1
War has always been (and will continue to be) conducted by/between groups. This is significant for two reasons. The first is that groups provide a scale that is essential for war. Regardless of how violent, physical confrontations between individuals are fights, not wars. Even small groups involved in violent physical confrontations do not rise to the status of war-there is just some unstated threshold below which violent conflict exists but simply is not war. Some political scientists in an attempt to quantify war have tried to establish a number of casualties or casualties per year that characterizes a war. 
2
The groups that fight wars are often states, but that is not necessarily a prerequisite. Increasingly we see nonstate actors fighting true wars against states. States continue to have difficulty with that notion, and seldom recognize nonstate actors as legitimate wagers of war. This (along with psychological factors rooted in the above distinction between legal war and murder) is why terrorists see themselves as warriors fighting for a righteous cause, and governments see terrorists as common, if very dangerous, criminals. The rules of war-traditional and under international treaty law-apply imperfectly if at all to nonstates. State and nonstate actors tend to be so completely different in terms of goals, cultures, and means that there is an automatic asymmetry in virtually every aspect of their relationship. There are no established procedures for negotiating conflict termination with nonstate actors-an action that would acknowledge some of the characteristics of a state and thus grant more status than states are likely to accept. None of that, however, changes the fact that groups-state or nonstate-fight wars.
The Prussian theorist Carl von Clausewitz identified three elements of war that he considered "its dominant tendencies" and the basis of its nature. Today called the Clausewitzian trinity, these were ". . .composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; of the play of chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and of its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to reason alone." 
3
Modern research has disproven the assertion that only man fights intraspecies war; 4 however, man's wars are on completely different scales of size and intensity than, for example, the territorial battles of chimpanzees. Because man fights wars, human emotions are a necessary component of warfare. Thus, passion, greed, fear, courage, etc.-all immutable elements of war and reflections of its nature as a human enterprise and what Clausewitz referred to when he wrote about primordial violence, hatred, and enmity-dominate warfare and are major elements of continuity. This changes somewhat (at least in its manifestation) as man withdraws further and further from the face-to-face battlefield, a trend that has been going on for centuries as weapons ranges increase. The artilleryman firing at an unseen enemy thousands of yards away faces a lower probability of death and thus feels less passion and encounters fewer examples of courage and cowardice than the infantryman engaging at 100 meters or less. Today, when Predator pilots are on a completely different continent than their targets, the human element of direct personal danger that has always been a part of the nature of war may at last be changing. However, other than a few radical airpower theorists who are usually reluctant to say so openly, the author is unaware of any serious work that predicts a war completely without human contact in the near future. Even the doomsday massive nuclear exchange scenarios popular at the height of the Cold War had conventional air, ground, and sea combat occurring, especially in Europe and the North Atlantic; often such conventional fights served as the trigger for the nuclear exchange, which might be decisive but was not a singular event. If and when we do see a totally standoff, sterile war, I believe human emotions will still be involved-perhaps not to the degree experienced during direct combat, but certainly in the political arena, where ego, ambition, avarice, cowardice, and courage will continue to play their roles. Thus, human emotions will remain elements of war.
In his theory, Clausewitz gave what is really an expansion of the second element of the trinity-the play of chance and probability-when he identified fog and friction as part of the nature of war. These concepts, so often stated together that they have become almost inseparable in common military parlance, are, in fact, distinct elements. "Fog" is the notion that nothing in war is known for certain-or, in Clausewitz's words, "the general unreliability of all information." He likened the resulting uncertainty to viewing something at twilight, through a fog, or by moonlight. Although it is traditional (and supported by comments elsewhere in the text) to consider this a slam on intelligence, it is obvious he was really writing about both friendly and enemy information. One simply cannot know exactly what is happening. Reports are wrong, enemy (and friendly) movements are misinterpreted, or things happen unobserved. The result is that "whatever is hidden from full view in this feeble light has to be guessed at by talent, or simply left to chance." 
5
"Friction" is the idea that things go wrong in war. It is sort of Murphy's Law on steroids-instead of anything that can (which implies some things cannot) go wrong, will go wrong, Clausewitz would say everything is likely to go wrong, or at least differently than planned. As a man of his time, Clausewitz liked to give examples or draw parallels to physics, so he compared this aspect of war to the natural friction of moving objects. However, again the concept is really fric-tion on steroids, since in war no movement is required to produce friction-things can actually go wrong without anybody doing or trying to do anything. For example, the weather can change with significant consequences but totally outside the control of anybody, or a vehicle can break down for no apparent reason while sitting in the motor pool. Clausewitz, however, did relate much of the friction to human activity, and he gave the useful comparison to working in a resistant medium (like walking in water). He also wrote, "Moreover, every war is rich in unique episodes. Each is an uncharted sea, full of reefs." Each reef represents a potential disaster through which the commander must steer without sure knowledge of the placement or even presence of the reefs. It is possible to at least partially overcome friction, but only practice and experience tell the general what is possible and what is not in war. 
6
Fog and friction are part of the larger continuity in war that Clausewitz called the play of chance and probability. 
7
Finally, and famously, Clausewitz pointed out the central function of politics in war. This is the third element of the trinity, and his assertion of the political nature of war has held up better than the limits critics have tried to place on his work (primarily, that it is state-centric and not applicable for times before the modern state or in cases in which one side is a nonstate actor). Politics is the very nature of war. Man in groups resolves issues through political processes-whether the primitive interpersonal relations of a tribe or the highly structured processes of the modern nationstate. War is one potential aspect of those political processes. Political intercourse continues after the outbreak of war, and political processes control the conduct of war. Clausewitz likened war to a form of expression during political discourse. The fact that one was fighting did not change the underlying politics-it was simply another form of expression. Clausewitz put it thus: "Its [war's] grammar, indeed, may be its own, but not its logic." 
8
For centuries, man has tried to determine why wars are won and lost. Several authors have developed, and many armies have adopted lists of words or phrases-usually called Principles of War-that describe strategic or operational best practices. 
9
11
If the nature of war (the logic in Clausewitz' words) remains the same, it is equally obvious that the conduct of war (its grammar) changes. How one fights a war is never a static, predictable process. Strangely, some of the changes in war occur within the elements of continuity. For example, war as a political act is an element of continuity, but the expression of that political process-the question of why men fight wars, if you wish-is very dynamic. History has seen cases of conquest for purposes of loot or power, wars of religion, colonial wars, nationalistic wars, wars of liberation, ideological wars, and mercantile wars, or wars over economic issues. Those are just some of the major categories-within each are numerous nuanced gradations of purpose/intent. In general, changes in why men fight reflect societal changes in a few basic elements-political ideology or philosophy, economics, and religion are some of the most prominent-and the acceptable means of pursuing goals rising from those elements. Thus, things like the introduction of Laws of Waressentially prearranged legal limits on the conduct of war-and Just War criteria-morally acceptable values about the resort to and conduct of war reflected and codified in international treaties like the United Nations (UN) Charter-change both the legitimate reasons and ways in which men fight.
Other than the changes inside the areas of general continuity mentioned above, change in the conduct of war tends to occur in two major categories: first, how wars are fought (ways), and next, with what wars are fought (means). How wars are fought includes issues like who participates, using what doctrine, in what type of campaign, and under what strategic concept. Thus, war necessarily changes as the composition of the military forces fighting it change. There is a difference between a tribal force, a village or territorial militia, a regular army, a mercenary army, a guerrilla army, a terrorist network, and a super-empowered individual. Each has had its day, and each fought (or fights) its wars in a different manner. Compounding this issue is the match or mismatch in perception and style of different types of forces as they face off. Thus, a regular force facing a guerrilla force encounters difficulties it would not experience if it fought another regular army. All of that produces outcomes that may appear as changes in the general characteristics of war or as the characteristics of the specific war under consideration.
Doctrine is important and directly related to the type of force that is fighting the war. For example, the specific military theories about how regular forces should fight are very different from theories of how guerrilla forces should fight. The doctrine reflects the tools expected to be available and the most probable situations the force is likely to face. It is the military equivalent of tactical, or in some cases operational, best practices, and it does make a difference in how one fights wars. Doctrine changes to reflect changed circumstances. The ancient Greeks formed in very close order with shields overlapping and used the mass of their formation to achieve battlefield dominance. 
12

14
The issues of what type of campaign and using what strategic concept are important and directly related. One approach is to try to win by destroying the enemy's fielded forces in a single decisive battle (a strategy of annihilation). Alternatively, one might achieve the same goal by whittling down the enemy's army over time (a strategy of attrition). In either case, the underlying objective is to make the enemy powerless by removing his military capability. Other strategies try to break the will of the enemy government or people over time by raids, bombing, or other means (strategies of exhaustion or erosion). Each general strategic category has numerous potential sub-strategies, and innovative commanders constantly create more. For example, under the general category of exhaustion, there are myriad strategies of the weak that try to win by not losing, erode political support of the government, or achieve political goals some other way. Nonstate actors can opt for any of the above or supplement the list with other concepts that suit their situation and resources. Each of these strategic choices changes the character of the immediate war, and that character can change rapidly and dramatically when the sides independently make radically different individual choices.
When one considers changes in the means of war, technology immediately comes to mind. One of the primary characteristics that distinguishes man from other animals is the use of tools. It was only natural for early man to apply tools to warfare. Another characteristic of man is innovationwe strive to find easier, cheaper, faster, more efficient, and effective ways of doing things. Thus, the application of innovation to weapons technology was inevitable. The result has been a gradual improvement in weapons that has accelerated dramatically in the modern era, but has always been present. We might look longingly at simpler, less complicated days when war seemed to be easier, but if they actually ever existed, they are gone forever.
Change in weapons technology has not followed a straight line. In fact, only the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, have seen constant exponential improvement in military technology. We went thousands of years using the spear, bow, sling, sword, and shield as our primary weapons, with only slight variations in design. Yet within that constancy, one can see cycles of change. The offensive or the defensive dominated as different societies applied technology to suit their cultures or strategic circumstances. Castles and fortifications had their periods as the dominant aspect of warfare, only to eventually fall to siegecraft techniques or new technology (like gunpowder). Thus, the effect of technological change has not been uniform or constant. In a sense, while the technology changes in a predictable manner, its application has not necessarily followed suit-people seem to continuously "reinvent the wheel" and bring back tactics, techniques, and procedures familiar from earlier days. One of the proposals for restructuring the U.S. Army for future war looks strangely reminiscent of the Roman legion, and Renaissance writers like Niccolò Machiavelli openly tried to reinstitute the same antique formation out of nostalgia, if for no other reason. 
15
Within that change, however, there are elements of continuity. Military technology has characteristics-call them rules, if you like-that seem to remain constant over time, space, and culture:
1. Once introduced, if technology proves effective, it tends to linger despite the introduction of other, newer, perhaps better technology (giving a high-low mix problem). The spear is a good example: It was probably the first intentionally designed weapon, but people were still using it in World War II. The Polish cavalry was armed with lances (although this was against government policy, and the legend of them attacking German tanks with spears is wrong); the British home guard also carried spears in the bleakest days of the war when other weapons were unavailable. 
16
2. New technology often gains ascendancy on the battlefield, but that ascendancy is never permanent. The introduction of significant technology automatically initiates a search for some means to counter, negate, minimize, or mitigate its effectiveness. Although a technology may maintain the upper hand for centuries, people eventually arrive at countertechnological or doctrinal solutions that either nullify a technology completely or at least make it no longer independently decisive. Frequently, the counter is simple, cheap, and easier to proliferate than the technology it counters. Thus, heavy cavalry lost its ascendancy during the Middle Ages to simple combinations of disciplined infantry and archers. The deployment of tanks in the anti-tank role, and the eventual invention of relatively cheap anti-tank missiles, removed the tank from the decisive role it had achieved early in World War II. Likewise, poison gas begot the gas mask; the high-walled castle fell victim to artillery; and field fortifications countered the battlefield effect of rapid-fire artillery on infantry. However, remember Rule 1-once introduced, technology lingers-so all those old technologies are still around and at least potentially effective on the field.
3. There have been relatively few truly revolutionary technological breakthroughs in warfare. Gunpowder, the internal combustion engine (the truck, tank, etc.), the airplane and submarine that added new dimensions to the battle space (although many historians look at them as applications of the engine), and the atomic bomb are really the only ones that have proven to be revolutionary, and the gunpowder revolution took long enough that it might be considered evolutionary. Advocates tout information technology as the next revolutionary advance in warfare, and it holds promise of fundamentally altering the way we fight. There is no denying it is an important and extremely significant advance. However, we have yet to see the true impact of information technology on the battlefield, and remember Rule 2-the counter for information technology may be cheap and effective.
4. Technology depends absolutely on doctrine. One can have the best technology in the world and still manage to lose by failing to use it to the best advantage. Thus, the Allies had more and arguably better tanks than the Germans during the blitz in Western Europe, but they employed them in a way that nullified their potential effectiveness. Moreover, doctrine alone may be decisive in a world of equal technology. The Romans were able to use disciplined infantry (a doctrinal solution) and technological flexibility to rule the world for centuries without a significant technological advantage over their numerous opponents. Doctrine allows blending of perhaps old or low technologies into new and very lethal systems. This is particularly true when the new system is especially difficult for existing military systems to counter. This phenomenon has recently acquired the grand title of asymmetry, but it is an ancient rather than a newly discovered aspect of war. One example of this at work is the invasion of Europe by the Huns under Attila in the mid-5th century. The nomadic steppe people combined their natural horsemanship with the compound bow-both military technologies known to Western civilization for millennia-to create an army so mobile and lethal that it was essentially invincible. The Huns (like other steppe nomads that plagued the West for centuries) had unmatched strategic mobility, so they appeared where least expected, and tactically European forces could not catch or pin them while being vulnerable to their archery.
5. Technology works best against opponents who, for whatever reason, cannot equal or counter it. To continue the Hun example, their European/Byzantine enemies serve as an excellent example here. Culturally, they were neither equestrians nor archers, and neither their infantry forces nor their cavalry could catch or hurt the Huns. The Byzantines bought them off and/or hired them as mercenaries until they could learn the necessary skills to face them on near equal terms.

8. Technological advances have tended to expand the reach of armies (either by increasing their speed or range) or to increase the distance at which they can strike their opponent. Crossing the deadly zone-that is, closing with the enemy-has become more and more difficult. In ancient days, that zone was frequently no deeper than a man could reach with his sword or spear, and never deeper than the range of a sling or arrow. Crossing it was a matter of a quick rush, perhaps holding a shield overhead to provide some protection from arrows. Today, we talk about battle space, and the most sophisticated armies can identify, engage, and destroy opponents at strategic distances. Nevertheless, people still manage to cross the deadly zone. Yet, remember Rule 2. It is easy to imagine an enemy cloaked in the electromagnetic clutter of an urban area or other simple countermeasures effectively shrinking the deadly zone to the range of a sword-in other words, leveling the technological playing field to the most primitive common denominator.
Is it possible to predict the future balance between change and continuity in war? If so, we should be able to determine the nature and characteristics of future war. Apparently, many people believe that is possible, and they usually claim to have already done the hard intellectual work when they inform the world of their startling conclusions. Most such arguments are unconvincing. They tend to follow one of two general patterns. First is the group that predicts that the future will be a lot like today, only more so. Fourth Generation War (4GW) theory, which in some cases has already mutated to Fifth Generation War, is an excellent example. 
25
In sum, nobody knows the future, and it takes extreme arrogance to claim to do so. However, that is not a reason to ignore people who have invested time and energy in thinking about the future of war. They may be right, and almost certainly some (and perhaps much) of what they say is right. We do need to think hard about the future of war. Prudent people will study the arguments and analyze the evidence, develop their own conclusions, realize they will be wrong, but hope Michael Howard was right when he said that military institutions never get the doctrine right in peacetime, and that does not matter-if they just get it close enough.

A THEORY OF VICTORY J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr.
The United States is developing a reputation much like Germany had in the 20th century of being tactically and operationally superb but strategically inept. Often stated as a tendency to win the war but lose the peace, this problem has a huge theoretical component that the national security community has only recently begun to address. In fact, the concept of victory is the biggest theoretical challenge facing security professionals today. We simply do not really understand what victory is and how it happens. Worse, we do not have the necessary intellectual framework to think about the problem. Doesn't everyone instinctively understand winning and losing-or at least hasn't everyone been taught since early childhood to understand those concepts? While there is truth in that assertion, it is not completely accurate in the field of warfare. What people understand as winning comes from the context with which they are most familiar-games and sports. In sports, winning is scoring more points or going faster than the other guy, usually within some pre-established parameters like time or distance. Card games, board games, and even computer games are similar in that there are clearly established conditions for winning-even if there might be multiple sets of potential outcomes that satisfy those conditions or multiple strategies for achieving them. The problem is that the concept of winning in sports and games is completely inadequate for understanding victory in war. Whatever war is, it is neither a sport nor a game, and analogies to either of those activities always fall short. In terms of a theory of victory, the first place a sports/game analogy falls short is specifically that there are no established or even universally accepted rules or conditions for winning in war. One might counter that soldiers and statesmen know-perhaps instinctively or perhaps as a result of training and study-that defeating the enemy's army produces victory. That may often be so, although it demonstrably does not work in every case, but our knowledge and understanding stops there. How does beating the enemy's army produce victory, and what can one do when that does not work?
The problem is that the security profession lacks a basic theoretical construct within which to think about winning wars. Because of this lack of theory, mankind has fought wars for at least 5000 years without systematically understanding why they are won or lost. In a sense, victory or defeat has always been a matter of serendipity or luck or intuition or genius or sheer hard fighting rather than the result of a well-thought-out and understood intellectual exercise. Gallons of ink have been expended over the centuries on how to win wars, but that effort has largely been uninformed by even a rudimentary theory of victory. Many existing theories of war skip over what victory is and why one theoretically wins or loses, to directly address the seemingly more difficult issue of how one wins a war militarily. When theorists do address winning, it is usually in passing, as an assumption from which their analysis proceeds, or as a tangential excursion from their primary topic. Clausewitz is an exception to this broad assertion, but his musings on winning are scattered and incomplete. There is a school of thought that claims theory is not necessary for competent performance.

Webster's Dictionary tells us a theory is simply a plausible or generally acceptable body of principles used to explain a phenomenon. A theory should provide basic definitions, assumptions, and testable hypotheses. The first task, then, is to define winning or victory in war. To get at the definitions, we will explore some hypothesis on victory around the issues of what victory is, how victory works, who decides the winner, and based on what criteria. Finally, we will present some thoughts on how one wins a war. These will be at a theoretical level rather than the more common debate about attrition versus maneuver, direct versus indirect approaches, etc. Regrettably, this paper may pose more questions than hard, reliable answers. That reflects the nature of the topic and is perhaps inevitable at this stage of the discussion.
Victory in war is at the most basic level an assessment, not a fact or condition. It is someone's opinion-or an amalgamation of opinions. In sports terms, to use one of those bad analogies I warned against, it is taking score at the end of a game, but it is done by a combination of fans, sportswriters, players, coaches, and league officials voting, each with an indeterminate degree of impact on the final result and each able to review and alter his vote at any time. Victory in war may or may not have anything to do with objective criteria like respective casualties, territory taken or lost, tons of bombs dropped, or facilities destroyed. In winning a war, those things matter-at least at some level and always in terms of their effect on perception-but what matters most is the ultimate perception of the situation, not the facts. And the perception will be of the effects, not the effort-there is no credit for trying hard. Different people, depending on their perspective, can legitimately differ in their assessment. Initial assessments of victory are often merely gut feelings, much like the Supreme Court's definition of pornography as something that depends on community values and you know when you see it. The assessment aspect complicates the issue of winning exponentially, since it introduces the uncontrolled variables of whose assessment counts, for how much, and based on what criteria. More on that later.
Related to this idea is the hypothesis that the results of war can actually be different for the opposing sides. Obviously, results from any direct interaction of two bodies will be closely related and interdependent. This is especially true of a contest between them, but because winning is an assessment, not a fact, the results of wars are independent for each side and may vary by participant. That is, the fact that one side won big does not necessarily mean its opponent lost big. It may not even mean that the other side lost at all, at least in terms of its own assessment.
Second, winning a war (as opposed to a battle or campaign) is a political condition. If war is a political act, victory at the highest levels must be defined in political terms. That is a fairly uncontroversial assertion today, but one with enormous implications. Misunderstanding or misapplying this simple concept is exactly why the United States gets criticized for winning the war but losing the peace, which is code for attaining decisive tactical and operational victories that do not produce similarly gratifying strategic results. The implication is that military victory (tactical or operational victory) without favorable political outcomes is sterile, and by any reasonable assessment that is true. But is knowing that victory is a political condition a sufficient understanding of winning? Actually, I believe it only serves to complicate or obscure the issue.
Next, and an aspect hinted at above-because it is a perception or assessment-victory or winning is heavily dependent on perspective. In a military sense, this translates into being sensitive to the level of war. It is possible to have a smashing tactical military victory that does not produce either operational or strategic results. Is that really a win? It certainly is from the point of view of the tactical commander-the view from the perspective of the operational or strategic commander might be quite different. It is this characteristic that allowed Saddam Hussein to claim victory after the First Gulf War. He suffered a huge tactical and operational loss, but his regime had survived (his strategic objective after the coalition intervened). The war was thus a strategic win for him-at least in his eyes and from his perspective. This again suggests the issue of who decides who wins and loses, which we will address later.
The characteristic of perspective allows us to think of victory in war as three tiered-tactical, operational, and strategic. Other authors have approached this categorization from different angles; for example, Martel calls his levels tactical, political-military, and grand strategic, and they do not correspond directly to the military levels. 
6
Because winning tactically is a fairly straightforward and almost exclusively military activity, we best understand it and can generally assess it through reasonably quantifiable criteria. Measures of effectiveness like comparative casualty ratios, ground taken or lost, sorties flown, tonnage sunk, prisoners captured, etc., all count and can actually produce a reasonable estimate of victory or defeat that is likely to be widely accepted. Again, however, the assessment is based on outcomes, not effort. There are complications inherent in fighting with allies or coalition partners, and fog and friction, chance and uncertainty, mean the outcome is never guaranteed, but the measures of tactical success are well understood. Operational victory is similarly transparent at least in its purest form; the campaign succeeds or fails based on criteria that are usually well understood and quantifiable. However, strategic victory is a more complicated issue.
It is worth reemphasizing that the relationship on the subject of winning between the levels of war, although closely linked, is not linear. Tactical success does not necessarily lead to operational success, which likewise does not guarantee strategic victory. In fact, winning on one level may actually lead to or result from losing on another. In Algeria in the 1950s, the brutal methods the French used to achieve a tactical victory were decidedly (perhaps decisively) counterproductive strategically. The art of war and strategy is largely making successes at each level contribute positively to successes at the higher levels.
Which level is most important? It is tempting to respond that all are equally important, but that would be incorrect. What counts in the end is the strategic outcome. The story comes to mind of COL Harry Summers talking to a North Vietnamese officer about that war. Summers commented that the U.S. had won all the battles, and the North Vietnamese replied,"That may be so, but it is also irrelevant." 
7
Finally, as Colin Gray and William Martel both point out, victory occurs on a sliding scale-or actually multiple sliding scales. Victory and defeat, although polar opposites, are not binary. There are thousands of points along the scale that delineate degrees of success. And winning may or may not be decisive in the sense of settling the underlying political issues, again on a whole range of degrees. Martel actually uses four scales, although the one he calls "levels" is analogous to the levels of war categorization and his "change in status quo" scale is essentially a measure of decisiveness. The other two categories of "degree of mobilization for war" and "extent of post-conflict obligations" are interesting, but I am not convinced they really relate theoretically to victory as much as they relate practically to the strategist as a means test.

Winning implies achieving success on the battlefield and in securing political goals, but not, for whatever reason, reaching total political success (i.e., victory). Thus, to win, one must accomplish one's immediate political goals, but not necessarily resolve all the underlying issues. Lesser levels of success reflect lesser degrees of battlefield achievement and/or lesser degrees of decisiveness in solving or resolving underlying issues. On the losing end, defeat is also a total concept. It implies failure to achieve battlefield success or to attain political goals and simultaneously not only not resolving underlying issues but actually exacerbating them. Thus, what we have is two components of success-or if you like, two measures of success-in war. They are portrayed here as the scales of achievement and decisiveness. These are related but independent variables. Decisiveness reflects a wide range of potential outcomes. The decisiveness scale (Figure

One might array the scales as axes and stack them by corresponding levels of war; however, I do not find that particularly useful or informative. All such manipulations really illustrate is that winning/victory requires separate definitions by level of war.
influences what winning looks like. In a sense, this (a political job) is the most difficult task in initiating a war. It is a policy task-why are we fighting and what will winning look like? This is the concept we call defining the end state, which the U.S. military taught its political masters during the frustrating limited wars and peacekeeping of the 1980s and 90s. political process of continual evaluation and assessment of possibilities and risks in a changing strategic environment. As an altered situation presents new strategic possibilities or challenges, a statesman would be negligent to ignore them. The effect of changing end states on winning is that every change in mission or end state alters acceptable strategic outcomes; that is, changes the conditions for victory. That changing end states should also cause the strategist to reevaluate ways and means is an important strategic problem that is not part of a theory of victory.
One author has postulated that winning is just achieving an outcome you like or at least prefer over other alternatives. The same author later writes, "'Victory' is an all-purpose word used to describe imprecisely the concept of success in war [italics in original]." 
10
However, it is clear that fighting will not stop unless the combatants see peace as more desirable than a continuation of conflict. In Clauswitzian terms, if the effort required exceeds the value of the political objective, the fighting must stop. 
11
Conversely, winning a war almost certainly implies that a state of peace exists even if the existence of peace does not necessarily imply victory. If one thinks of peace as the normal state and war as an aberration, then peace should follow victory. That is, victory should bring the situation back to a sustainable steady state. If war is the normal state interrupted occasionally by periods of temporary peace, this may not be the case. However, Americans tend to view the world as normally at peace with occasional interruptions of war. Thus, an American definition of winning would be closely linked to peace and security. The immediate peace at the conclusion of a war is generally a period when combat ceases (a military condition), because one side collapses and either stops fighting or surrenders, or because one or both sides decide stopping is in their best interest. But none of that has anything to do with winning. One cannot discern from a postwar state of peace who won or lost the war. In fact, one can cite cases of decisive military wins that do not result in perfect peace-low-grade insurgencies often follow crushing military victories without altering the overall assessment of winning and losing. This is particularly true at the tactical and operational levels.
Winning is no different if your goal is positive or negative, that is, if you are trying to accomplish something or prevent something. The same is true for limited or total goals. It really makes no difference if the goal is something existential like continuing to exist as a nation or something less vital like "signaling." There is a difference, however, in the degree of difficulty. Total wars or wars for some concrete object like possession of territory are much more likely to be judged by concrete criteria-did you achieve or prevent the occupation of the territory; who was still standing at the end of a total war? There are also no absolute criteria that ensure victory. When President Bush announced the end of major combat operations after Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, he was proclaiming victory. He was (and remains) absolutely correct in his claim. At that moment and from an American perspective, the U.S. and its coalition partners stood victorious over a badly beaten Iraqi military. The coalition had achieved all the classic measures of a tactical and operational victory-destroyed the enemy military and occupied his capital and country. However, because there are no absolute criteria, and winning is not fixed or permanent, that victory slipped away as other political forces exerted themselves. Going back to the sports analogy, some of the voters changed their vote-or as the game reached the final innings, their votes suddenly became more significant. Perhaps it was a new game with new players and new rules. The point is that victory is an assessment, and assessments can change.
Can both sides win a war? If so, why fight? It would seem that reasonable men could discover the political solution that is likely to result from war without the unfortunate necessity of all the shooting and killing. That, however, has never been the case, and it is so because of both the nature of war and the nature of victory. War is a dynamic process. As it progresses the political objectives can change. Thus, the peace settlement upon which the assessment of victory and defeat will be made may have little relation to the initial political issues-although the most basic and loudly proclaimed are likely to get at least lip service in the final settlement. World War I is an excellent example of this phenomenon. The issues that provoked the war (at least the most immediate political issues) did not require four years of total war, so ends escalated as the effort expended escalated, and the final settlement had almost nothing to do with the original issues. Conversely, unexpectedly stiff resistance can force politicians to scale back on initial political objectives. The point is that it is impossible for all except the Monday morning quarterback to decipher the likely postwar political settlement. Additionally, if his political goals are very limited, such as demonstrating capability, showing resolve, or sending messages, the presumptive loser may be able to correctly claim he accomplished his objective and thus won. This is particularly true in cases of indecisive battlefield results, but it can occur after decisive tactical victories. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War provides an example. At the conclusion of hostilities, the Egyptians had crossed the Suez, still had forces on the eastern side, and had stood up to the Israelis. Politically, they could overlook the fact that when the ceasefire went into effect the Israelis were conducting a counterattack, had isolated one of the two attacking Egyptian armies, and were in position to complete its destruction. The Egyptians were in a difficult military situation, but President Sadat was able to negotiate and accept the Camp David peace accord precisely because he was able to persuasively (at least to the Egyptian people) claim victory in the war. Thus, one side can win big without the other side necessarily losing big-or even at all.
It is equally possible for neither side to win, unless one postulates an unwritten rule that a tie go to the underdog for not losing. The theorist Sir Basil H. Liddell Hart wrote, "Peace through stalemate, based on a coincident recognition by each side of the opponent's strength, is at least preferable to peace through common exhaustion-and has often provided a better foundation for lasting peace." 
12
Is there a temporal aspect to winning a war either in terms of achieving it or in terms of sustaining the assessment over time? Obviously winning takes some amount of time, and equally obviously, the amount of time and effort expended will influence assessments of the postwar political situation. A strategic victory must also have some temporal permanence-rational assessments of victory will never concede success to a condition that is only sustainable for a matter of weeks or months. However, because winning at the strategic level is an assessment of political results, it is subject to revision. Victory can be reevaluated either in terms of achievement or decisiveness, and is, therefore, not necessarily permanent. The degree of impermanence relates directly to the magnitude of the achievement and its decisiveness. World War I again provides an example. At the time, the outcome looked like an Anglo-French-American victory. Over time the degree of decisiveness has been reevaluated. Now the result is generally considered to be a military success that did not resolve and in some cases aggravated underlying issues. This ex post facto reevaluation of the decisiveness scale has so radically altered the assessment of victory that some authors talk about World Wars I and II as one long war.
Tactical and operational victories, because of their firmer basis of judgment, tend to remain fixed. Only very marginal victories at those levels are subject to reinterpretation. That is also true of significant, very decisive strategic wins. It is much more difficult to reevaluate a total victory that decisively settles the political issues involved than to reevaluate a situation somewhere lower on the sliding scales. For example, it is unlikely that anyone will ever seriously claim Germany or Japan won World War II. In each of those cases one can look at subsequent history and say the long-term outcome was overall beneficial for all the countries involved; however, that does not change the assessment of winning and losing. The degree of impermanence also relates to the degree of consensus on the assessment. Results that are universally accepted are difficult to change.
Does or should the cost affect victory? Of course it does. Liddell Hart pointed out that a victory is useless if it breaks the winner's economy or military or society.

Because of the reasonably measurable victory conditions at the tactical and much of the operational levels, who decides who won or lost at those levels is not especially controversial. That is not true, however, at the strategic level, and the operational level also can get contentious as it merges with the strategic. If victory at the strategic level is an assessment of the postwar political conditions, then who does the assessment becomes a critical issue. Does the victor decide whether he won or lost? The vanquished? Both? Neither? What about a "disinterested" or uninvolved party? Can the decider be multiple people? If multiple people, must there be unanimity, a consensus, a majority, or a plurality? Of whom/what-public opinion, national opinion, world opinion? If the decider can be multiple, could one get several different (and equally valid) decisions? The issues here are endless, and that is just to decide who makes the assessment. There is a whole second set of issues around the question of what criteria should be used for the assessment. Is there an objective set of criteria? Are the criteria cultural? Are the criteria different for different kinds of war (total or limited)? Do the criteria vary over time? We must also keep in mind that everyone who makes an assessment uses his/her own scales and can place the degree of achievement and/ or decisiveness wherever he or she wants.
Despite its complexity the question has a simple answer. Because we have defined this as an assessment of the postwar political condition, it is a political issue and everyone gets an opinion. Then the problem becomes not who decides but whose opinion matters, and that is a much more manageable issue. As a general rule, opinion counts based on the political clout of the opinion holder. For Americans the opinions that matter in order of priority are: 1) the American people; 2) American political and military elites (1 and 2 together might be thought of as American public opinion on military issues); 3) the opinion of our friends and allies; and, 4) world opinion-sort of everybody else. As the issue fades from the immediate political forum, the interested audience declines precipitously until eventually only historians will debate the issue. However, by then the base assessment of winning and losing will already have been established, and historical debates will be adjustments based on new evidence or consequences revealed by the passage of time.
Of course, the analogue of this process occurs in the enemy country or organization (if a nonstate actor). Who decides in the enemy camp and how is a critical but very situationally dependent fact. It must be considered in the strategic estimate process, but this paper cannot attempt to speculate on how it might work.
Returning to our own side, how does one determine American public opinion? Usually the mass media and polling agencies sense and report public opinion. Is polling accurate for a war? Absolutely not, if "accurate" means that it reflects conditions on the ground; but it is generally accurate as a reflection of what the public believes. Is there ever a poll that asks, "Did we win such and such a war?" No, probably not. So, if the normal process does not function in this case, how do we determine who won and lost?
The determination results from the confluence of two other processes. First, political leaders try to convince the public. That is successful or not, based on the facts of the particular circumstances, the persuasiveness of the message, and the perceived legitimacy and veracity of the messenger. Credible politicians backed by convincing evidence of military achievement and political profit can proclaim victory and simply establish the fact. The second process is more like the pornography test-people just recognize victory when they see it. They make up their own minds using whatever evidence they have. This is a much more subjective process, which quickly escapes political control (or is controlled by atypical political forces). The consequence of this is that at the strategic level victory and defeat can be as much issues of public perception and even partisan politics as they are of battlefield achievement or diplomatic negotiations.
However, there is another key point to consider. Clausewitz said victory was tripartite. "If in conclusion we consider the total concept of a victory, we find it consists of three elements:
1. The enemy's greater loss of material strength. 2. His loss of morale.
3. His open admission of the above by giving up his intentions." 
16
Clausewitz was writing about tactical victory where his three points are usually apparent. At the strategic and even operational level the assessment is much more difficult and debatable. The admission of loss, however, is an important caveat for all levels, and at all levels it intertwines with the issue of who decides. This is particularly evident at the tactical level, but there are times when one side or the other for whatever reason-too dumb or too stubborn or too committed, even, to accept defeat-continues the fight. Usually, this leads to disaster, but occasionally the stubborn individual who refuses to accept defeat can actually snatch victory. Ulysses Grant at Shiloh is an example at the tactical level. Although he was and nearly driven off the field on the first day, Grant's refusal to admit defeat and his attack the next day produced a smashing tactical victory. Significantly, acceptance of defeat makes mute the issue of who decides who won-both sides acknowledge the outcome, and it is difficult for even the most radical reinterpretation to contest the decision.
Traditionally, governments indicate they are beaten by signing some form of peace accord or treaty, while armies acknowledge defeat by formally surrendering or perhaps agreeing to an armistice. Those are very important symbolic acts as an acknowledgement of victory and defeatthey are an integral and perhaps essential part of the political/social mythology of victory. They indicate to the other legs of the Clausewitzian trinity that the government and/or the army thinks itself beaten and that further resistance is futile. This is important even if parties not part of the process do not accept the verdict and try to continue the war. At a minimum, and disregarding for the moment all the impacts on legitimacy and logistics, formal governmental or military surrender will have a huge impact on the will of the remaining trinitarian elements. It is difficult for either the people or the military to continue fighting if the government has formally surrendered, and the government faces the huge challenge of recreating a military if its army has surrendered. Battleship Missouri-like ceremonies acknowledging victory and defeat are extremely important and significant. However, such ceremonies must be authentic to be useful. Contrived ceremonies for the sake of having a formal surrender do not convince the target audience. Unilaterally proclaiming victory from the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier was better than conducting a trumped-up ceremony featuring "Bagdad Bob," but a formal surrender by Saddam Hussein or an acknowledged major subordinate legitimately representing the Iraqi government would have been better still.
The current thinking that there will not be such a ceremony at the conclusion of the War on Terrorism is probably correct; however, there should have been such a ceremony at the conclusion of the initial phases in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Especially in Iraq, the people needed to see and believe that the Saddam government was actually defeated. The difference in the War on Terrorism is that the enemy is a non-state actor. There are no internationally recognized procedures for accepting the surrender of non-state actors, and if there were, no state could take lightly legitimiz-ing such an actor even by formally accepting its surrender. If non-state actors mirror/mimic in some ways the trinitarian characteristics of states, the impact of formal surrender might be similar, but the extent of such similarity is unclear. For example, it is not certain that the surrender of the leader of a non-state actor (who is presumably analogous to the government in a state sense) would have the same impact as the surrender of the head of a government. This is the reasoning behind warnings that the capture or death of Osama Bin Laden will not end the War on Terrorism.
So, what can we conclude about victory in warfare so far? It is an assessment of two variablesachievement and decisiveness-at three levels-tactical, operational, and strategic. At the tactical and in most cases the operational levels winning is a military condition, and the assessment rests on reasonably well understood military criteria. At the strategic level (and the portions of the operational that directly overlap the strategic), public opinion decides who wins and loses and to what extent, based on an assessment of the postwar political conditions. The military situation as the public understands or interprets it will, of course, play a huge role in the assessment, but the overriding criteria will be political. To be effective, a victory must be recognized and accepted by the opponent and sustainable over time. Thus, strategic victory in war is a positive assessment of the postwar political situation in terms of achievement and decisiveness that is acknowledged, sustainable, and resolves underlying political issues. Similarly, Tactical victories are battlefield military outcomes that achieve their purpose and give one side a significant, acknowledged advantage over its opponent. Substituting operational for tactical and eliminating battlefield in the above definition yields a satisfactory definition of operational victory.
Theoretically, how one wins a war is fairly straightforward-it is doing it that is difficult. Clausewitz pointed out that war is both a physical and moral struggle. His recipe for victory was simple: "If you want to overcome your enemy you must match your efforts against his power of resistance, which can be expressed as the product of two inseparable factors, viz. the total means at his disposal and the strength of his will." (italics in original) 
17
In the formula, R represents the power of resistance, M is the total means available, and W is the strength of will. Victory then, is achieved as R approaches zero; that is, as the power of resistance drops to an ineffective level. One can push R toward zero by reducing either M or W (or both). In some respects one might think of a strategy designed to attack the M aspect of the equation as a physical approach and a strategy designed to address the W aspect as psychological, although making such a distinction too starkly can be dangerous, since both elements will appear in any strategy. We will examine briefly both approaches.
The traditional concept of winning a war is based on reducing the enemy's means of resistance. This is generally done physically. Typically, it involves destroying or neutralizing the enemy's military or at least attriting it to the point of ineffectiveness. The underlying purpose is to remove the enemy's capability to resist so you can impose your will on him directly. The theorist of deterrence, Thomas Schelling, wrote about the use of military power to hurt. His point was that one function of militaries is to inflict pain on the enemy. Inflicting pain is easiest when the enemy cannot resist-that is, after you have beaten him in battle. 
18
19
Attacking psychologically to reduce the enemy's will to resist works somewhat differently. The intent of all action is not to place oneself in position to impose one's will but to cause the enemy to lose his will and quit. All strategies designed with this intent share two major issues. First, is whose will should one attack? If we accept Clausewitz's description of the forces interacting in war as the people, the government, and the military, then we can ascribe a will to each. 
20
Whom do we wish to convince? Ultimately it must be the enemy government but in some cases it may be easier to work on leading personalities (e.g. Chamberlain at Bad Godesberg or Munich), choosing arguments to which they are most susceptible. Alternatively it may be best to work directly on a certain section of public opinion which has some hold over the government or an influential Allied Government or through UNO [the United Nations]. 
21
The recent rediscovery of counterinsurgency (COIN) theory provides other possibilities. COIN theory generally acknowledges the population as the objective-in terms of a theory of victory, it is the population that decides what victory is and who prevails. Winning hearts and minds is how one wins COIN because the people's will counts most. That is not the case in all wars.
The examples imply whose will matters most may be largely an issue of the type of war one is fighting. This goes back to Clausewitz's famous dictum about the first and greatest act of a commander and statesman being to understand the nature of the war in which he is about to engage. 
22
The second issue in reducing the enemy's will is understanding how to break will. There is a classic approach that is highly physical. One physically seizes, perhaps preemptively, what he wants or what is important. That is, he directly imposes his will on the enemy. In its purest form, the idea is that the enemy will concede the political point (i.e., his will breaks) without further contest. This is the most easily understood concept and makes postwar assessment simple-you either have or don't have what you said you wanted. Execution is also theoretically simple. It involves directly taking or doing what you want. If the enemy's will persists, you are still presumably in a better position for the fight that follows than you were before the opening of the gambit. There is nothing wrong with this concept of winning, and it is a very useful approach when the desired end is suitable. It is, of course, both most useful and common when there is a significant disparity between opposing forces, since the enemy will presumably try to counter your move.
In other will-oriented approaches, physical effects are also important and are typically a primary method. Remember that Clausewitz said physical means and will were inseparable. 
23
24
25
The only method currently available to attack will directly is information operations; all the other options attack indirectly through some other aspect presumed to influence will. However, information operations are very blunt instruments whose impact is incredibly difficult to predict or target reliably. Second-and third-order effects are always present and may produce exactly the opposite of the intended result. Conversely, if victory is an assessment, information operations are strategically critical in deciding the winner. Our inability to come to grips intellectually, physically, or psychologically with this aspect of war in an age when control of information is impossible is a huge part of our current perceived inability to achieve positive strategic results.
What role do ethics play in winning? This is not the classic question of whether war is really a no-holds-barred fight to the finish, or whether there are or should be rules/ethical limitations. The ethical component of winning, if one exists, is limited to two aspects. The first, is how much weight, if any, the decider gives to the ethical conduct of the war. If the entity making the victory assessment uses ethics as a standard of measurement, ethics are significant in victory; if the decider ignores ethics in his analysis, ethics will play no role in victory. A second way ethics figure in the victory equation is that ethical (or unethical) conduct may have second-or third-order effects that influence durability. Thus, a war that initially looks like a victory may become something less as evidence of unethical conduct emerges. Like every other aspect of the victory assessment, the ethics standard does not necessarily apply equally to both sides, is a sliding scale rather than a binary ethical/non-ethical assessment, and considers or ignores acts/issues serendipitously. The American people expect ethical conduct of war and might very easily assess a war conducted in an unethical manner as a loss regardless of battlefield outcomes. That appears to be at least a portion of the attitude behind the resistance to the Iraq war, which rages as I write. Ethical considerations in the victory assessment are self-imposed and self-enforced, but they are real.
What is the bottom line? Victory in war is about breaking will. Eliminating means of resistance completely is impossible. Theoretically there will always be one enemy soldier armed with at least a knife who is willing to give his life to continue the fight. Destroying the enemy's means without breaking his will leaves you with a less capable but still hostile foe. Conversely, breaking the will to resist ends the war regardless of the enemy's remaining combat capability. The issue then becomes the much more practical one of how does one break an enemy's will? This is where we loop back on our argument. Will is a difficult concept to define-much less attack directly-so militaries invariable attack the enemy military as a means not to reduce his power of resistance to zero and win, but as a means to destroy his will. Concepts like classic strategic air power theory that attempts to bypass fielded forces to attack enemy will (either government or people) directly or John Warden's strategic rings that add to the classic approach the idea of striking command and control and other vital systems to make resistance ineffective are tempting, because theoretically they should work. They should not be ignored, but if one is looking for promising alternative approaches to victory, the field of information operations is the most fertile available. We just need to get out of the technological emphasis (or perhaps fixation) and approach it from the direction of understanding how one influences opinion, especially political will.
War is about winning. This is not a new concept. The general and theorist Raimondo Montecuccoli wrote in the 17th century: "War is an activity to inflict damage in every way; its aim is victory"-and the concept was already ancient by then. 
26
27
However, the fact that war is about winning does not mean war is about victory. One can win a war, especially a limited war (a war that is consciously limited in either or all of ends, ways, or means), without achieving victory. Military force can legitimately be used to obtain goals short of the total victory where one's forces end up standing over a prostrate enemy with a bayonet at his throat dictating peace terms. It is also legitimate to use military force for immediate political advantage, even understanding that one may not resolve the underlying issues.
This points out that war is also about politics, and consequently in the final analysis, strategic victory must be a political state. It is a perception by the people that matter that one side did better overall in a war than the other. The judgment is based on results, not effort. At the strategic level the scale of assessment is political, although physical or military aspects like casualties influence considerations, and some acts (like the capture or loss of specific territory) may have a decisive impact on the assessment when that issue is the basis of the political dispute. Liddell Hart was correct when he asserted that the object of war is a better peace if only from our point of view. Attaining that object is a primary prerequisite for victory. That may translate in political terms into a fairly innocuous set of less-than-optimal conditions that are more acceptable than the alternative, but the public must assess their attainment as a positive achievement worth the cost. The assessment must be shared by the people that matter. In America that is the general public and the political elites. The enemy must also accept the assessment if we expect the condition to last for any reasonable amount of time.
Winning is different at different levels of war, and winning at some levels can produce unintended results and even losses at other levels. Because winning is an assessment and subject to interpretation, it is sensitive to perspective. Tactical conditions that look like winning may be counterproductive strategically. This is particularly true when the goal is overtly political, like winning the hearts and minds of the people.
War is a contest of wills conducted with physical means. This concept is absolutely critical to understanding the nature of war and the nature of victory. It leads directly to scales for weighing victory. One can assess any and every physical means employed against its probable outcome in terms of enemy and friendly will. If, despite how tactically effective it might be, the strategic result is likely to be minimal or unfavorable, its use must be very carefully considered. A great example is the 500-lb bomb in the counterinsurgency role. Five-hundred-pound bombs, regardless of how accurately targeted, inevitably produce collateral damage. In a COIN situation one might kill the targeted insurgents, perhaps in great numbers, but if the explosion also kills or injures bystanders (regardless of how innocent or complicit they might be) or even property, their use is inadvisable.
It is a characteristic of war that both sides try to dominate the opponent's will while protecting their own. The respective wills of the people, government, and military of both sides are potentially vulnerable. Protecting one's own will is as important as attacking that of the opponent. The military is responsible for its will-politicians are responsible for the wills of both the government and the people. While the will analysis works best for state-on-state contests, it is also applicable to wars with non-state actors. In their case, some of the components may be atrophied or combined in the same person or element, but because Clausewitz's initial concept of the trinity dealt with basic characteristics of war that he then ascribed to the legs of the trinity, each of the trinitarian elements is still represented by some entity, even in a non-state actor, where there may not be an identifiable people, military, or government. Targeting will in an enemy state is difficult enough; the same task against a non-state actor is extremely tough.
Because war is a contest of wills, and victory is an assessment made by peoples or governments, information is critical, and being clumsy or too scrupulous in that arena unnecessarily ties one's hands. Being inept at information operations can be strategically fatal regardless of the power of one's military, the skill of one's diplomats, or the size of the one's GDP.
Because war is about will and winning is an agreed-upon assessment, formal ceremonies to acknowledge victory and defeat are important traditional psychological tools and political/social symbols that should be sought whenever possible. However, sham ceremonies featuring insignificant functionaries do not accomplish the same objective and may in fact be counterproductive.
Have we answered (or even asked) all the relevant questions? Certainly not. There is much work remaining in this arena. I hope, however, that these thoughts can advance the discussion. If not, we may end the 21st century still bemoaning our inability to turn spectacular tactical victories into decisive strategic results.
Frank L. Jones "More, more, more…to destroy whole cities, provinces, an entire country, the whole world, this would be the greatest happiness." 1 These words conclude Polish author Stanislaw Przybyszewski's novel of terrorism, Satan's Kinder (Children of Satan), as the protagonists delight in torching a nameless city. At the time of its publication in Berlin in 1897, this German-language novel was a popular work of fiction. Critics of the time, citing the limited technical means for carrying out such enormous devastation, dismissed the story as a mere fantasy or just another apocalyptic vision of the sort fashionable at the turn of the century. 
2
Nonetheless, despite volumes of books, articles and studies of terrorism, there has been scant investment made in developing a theory of terrorism. Instead, scholars and practitioners devote their efforts to writing about the history of terrorism, examining a variety of terrorist movements, discussing the influence of political ideologies and religious belief on terrorists' motives, dissecting their operational environments, or analyzing the psychological makeup of terrorists. This has resulted in a broken-looking-glass approach to understanding terrorism, whereby each shard casts a portion of the image but not a complete likeness. As Richard Schultz points out, there has been intense study of terrorism, but the literature has been "primarily descriptive, prescriptive and very emotive in form." 
3
This is an unfortunate state of affairs with serious repercussions, perhaps even disastrous results. It leads government officials to fixate on tactics, which, in turn, leads to the belief that there is a political, social, or economic antidote or vaccine-some combinatory "drug cocktail" that, if used, can eliminate terrorism. Tactics, as Carl von Clausewitz observed, are fighting techniques that can be addressed with prescriptive doctrine, that is, at a level where method and routine are useful and even essential. Strategy involves questions of broad purpose in which complexity, contingency and difficulty rule-doctrine is not only useless; it is unattainable.

One of the reasons for a lack of focus on theoretical and conceptual issues, it is argued, stems from the definitional problems associated with the term "terrorism." Some scholars have become so discouraged by the lack of an accepted definition that they have abandoned any attempt to devise it. Walter Laqueur, a noted scholar of terrorism, contends, "A comprehensive definition of terrorism…does not exist nor will it be found in the foreseeable future." 6 However, sociologist Jack Gibbs suggested that it is impossible to pretend to study terrorism without some of form of definition; otherwise, discussion lapses into obscurantism. He also argues that one of the problems is definitional parsimony to the degree that oversimplification occurs: "… it is inconsistent to grant that human behavior is complex and then demand simple definitions of behavioral types."

For the purposes of this paper, strategy is defined as a "synergy and symmetry of objectives, concepts and resources to increase the probability of policy success and the favorable consequences that follow from that success….Strategy accomplishes this by expressing its logic in rational, linear terms-ends, ways and means." 
11
The first premise is that "political purpose dominates all strategy." 12 Political as defined herein is an enunciation of policy, an expression of the preferred end state, whether it is attainable or not. Ideally, this policy is clearly articulated by the terrorist leaders, as it represents guidance for the employment of means, the instruments of coercive or persuasive power, toward the achievement of aims. However, policy can change as the strategic environment or circumstances change-for example, limitations imposed by others on the means available to the terrorists.
A second premise is the primacy of the strategic environment, which has a number of dimensions.

The seventh and final premise is that terrorists understand the importance of strategic risk; recognize the inherent existence of uncertainty, chance, and nonlinearity in the strategic environment; and attempt to produce a favorable balance in the ends-ways-means calculation to overcome or at least ameliorate the impact. Nonetheless, the risk of failure remains. 
25
26
27
Violence is the principal way or strategic concept by which terrorists will achieve their espoused ends. The terrorist uses collective violence-that is, personal injury by a group, albeit a small one-as a form of protest, a quest for justice, and the purposeful expression of concrete and identifiable grievances, which are precipitated by any number of social, economic, [cultural], or political issues. 
28
29
30
Moreover, violence, as Martha Crenshaw notes, is the "primary method of action," and terrorists are individuals who have a bias for action-are "impatient for action." 
31
32
33
34
There appear to be two factors that promote this aim of prompting governmental action. First, there is some evidence that if the terrorist tells the target how to find relief from the stress, there is less chance of inaction. Second, sporadic violence, as opposed to sustained relentless violence, appears to be more psychologically and socially effective by creating fear, anxiety, and a feeling of vulnerability as well as undermining society's networks of trust, solidarity, cooperation, and interdependence. 
35
36
Thus, for the terrorist, the threat of violence must combine with unpredictability in the mind of the potential victims. Violence becomes a form of "costly signaling." Terrorists employ costly signaling to signal their resolute and credible willingness to resort to violence, a costly action. The terrorists cannot afford to bluff or lie, since to do so would only undermine their claims of strength and capability to impose costs on those who oppose them. 
37
38
39
40
The tactics of terrorism are simple. They are the visible and violent acts taken by the means or resources available, which include not only terrorist foot soldiers but also other resources such as finances, weapons, and other materiel. These tactics further the group's ends as well as provide inducements needed to recruit and maintain a membership. These acts consist of assassination, arson, bombings (including suicide bombings), armed robbery, and kidnapping for the purposes of extortion. They are used to destabilize society in three respects: political instability by killing government leaders and undermining the political process; social instability by disrupting various systems of exchange (social, economic) and by propagating such fear that distrust becomes normal and disorder results; and moral instability by provoking authorities to respond to these political and social threats with brutal actions that will delegitimate vital institutions in the society. 
41
The late Philip Windsor argued that terrorists' objectives are rooted in the "conditions of an historical legacy that have created a cause that can no longer be defined in terms of political compromise but instead must be redefined in terms of a moral claim." 42 "The agenda is dominated by long-standing historical legacies that have created a universe of moral problems." Thus, terrorists understand themselves to be "inheritors dispossessed by history." It is this historical grievance of being cheated of their "rightful" inheritance and their "quest for legitimacy in an as-yet only imagined proper order that lends them moral justification." This is an important distinction for the tendency on the part of those who seek to counter terrorism is that only two options are available. The first is that terrorism must be wiped out because it hampers civilized political discourse. The other is the belief that a dialogue with the terrorists is critical to co-opt them into the political process. Both of these avenues may prove sterile. The extermination of terrorists tends to breed more terrorists and thus confirms the moral claims of the terrorists, while co-optation can prove futile because moral claims cannot always be solved by political resolution. 
43
44
46
More dangerously, the vast majority of terrorists cannot articulate the political stages or tasks necessary to achieve their objectives but instead offer only an end state. Further, terrorism may be considered, according to Jeffrey Alexander, "postpolitical," that is, "it reflects the end of political possibility." If that becomes the case, then it is an experience of overwhelming political impotence expressed through "drawing blood." Its tactics "deliver maiming and death; they serve a strategy of inflicting humiliation, chaos, and reciprocal despair." 
47
48
In this respect, terrorism is a deliberate political choice by a political actor to use the power to hurt. 
49
50
51
52
53
54
Ultimately, terrorism is an exceedingly rational strategy, calculated in terms of costs and benefits with the terrorist relying on the accuracy of those calculations. 
55
56
Terrorism operates in two dimensions simultaneously-as a theory of violence and as a strategy of violence perpetrated to achieve a putative end. Tying these two concepts together, which is the thrust of this essay, the strategic theory of terrorism is a theory of action-to paraphrase Bernard Brodie-with violence as the critical and defining element in both of these dimensions. 
57

Gray answers the question by referring to two theorists: Clausewitz and Hedley Bull. Clausewitz defined war as "an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will." 
60
61
62
63
Some thinkers suggest that terrorism is a form of "new war," and that Clausewitz overlooks unconventional and so-called non-Trinitarian war, thereby arguing that Clausewitz and his remarkable trinity is not relevant.

T. S. Eliot concluded his 1925 poem "The Hollow Men" with the words: "This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang, but a whimper." These are words worth remembering. Some scholars point to the apocalyptic cast of contemporary terrorism, particularly its religious variant, suggesting that this form of terrorism is unlike its predecessors in that the actors are irrational, self-destructive, and are marching willingly to martyrdom. Others point to the fact that religious terrorism represents a new "wave," or it is a "cosmic war," significantly different from political terrorism. 
70
71
72
While terrorists' ideology, regardless of its stripe, offers a criticism of the existing political system and a prophecy of a perfectly just and harmonious society that will last the ages, it is imperative as well to understand the strategic challenge that terrorism represents. As Colin Gray reminds us, it would be imprudent to believe that terrorists are isolated from the world of strategy any more than that can be said of other practitioners of small wars and savage violence, even professional soldiers.

Nearly 2-and-a-half millennia have passed since the Greek historian Thucydides composed his famous history of the Peloponnesian War (432-404 B.C.E.).

Policy and strategy, defined as the craft of statesmanship and the use of military force in the pursuit of political aims, are practical undertakings. Many U.S. commanders carried copies of Antoine Jomini's work onto the battlefields of the American Civil War-the Swiss theorist made a conscious attempt to provide maxims that could be applied to tactical and operational problems. Alexander the Great is reported to have slept on campaign with a version of The Iliad prepared by his tutor, Aristotle, at his bedside (as modern commanders might carry a Bible or Koran)-cultural inspiration may also serve as a foundation for waging war. It is difficult to imagine Thucydides in a knapsack on campaign; his insights are too complex to serve as guides on the tactical level, and his conclusions too elusive to provide cultural inspiration. His work has a different kind of merit, however, that is perhaps no less relevant and profound.
What Thucydides provides is strategic insight. He offers invaluable points of orientation for statecraft and supreme command in the domain of national policy, as well as searing judgments about the factors that lead states to victory or defeat in protracted strategic competition. His subject is the institution of war in all its dimensions, and his text illustrates that although we no longer fight with shields and stabbing spears, on the strategic level warfare has remained remarkably constant over time. Those who read Thucydides for the first time are usually struck by his work's astonishing current relevance-not so much as an agenda for action as a guide to understanding. 
15
Much of the current literature concerning the Peloponnesian War is focused on the conflict itself, considered as an event in space and time that can be understood empirically. Victor  David  Hanson's recent study, A War Like No Other, emphasizes the distinctiveness of the struggle, which he portrays as an armed conflict virtually unique in history in its scope and complexity. 
16
There is an ongoing debate about the accuracy of Thucydides's narrative, but it rests on distressingly few supplementary sources (essentially stone tablets containing state records and a very small number of fragmentary primary and secondary accounts). Basically, much of Thucydides's story must either be accepted on faith or rejected as improbable. Thucydides was in an excellent position to assemble an accurate record of events. His appreciation for the importance of the war gave him a strong motive to do so. And he went out of his way to demonstrate his objectivity, a trait for which his work has long been appreciated. David Hume, later echoed by Immanuel Kant, famously remarked that the first page of his text "was the commencement of real history," while even the skeptical George Cawkwell lauds his "monstrous passion for the truth."

What do we know about Thucydides? Three vitae survive from the Byzantine period, but they are contradictory and sometimes clearly erroneous. Most of what we can assert derives from what Thucydides himself tells us in four brief references to his personal circumstances in The Peloponnesian War, and perhaps more importantly from what we can infer about the author from reading his text.

One might surmise that as a young man Thucydides turned away from the oligarchic political preferences that would come naturally to someone of his social standing, and embraced the idealism of Periclean Athens. The tribute to the civic culture of democratic Athens that he transcribes in Pericles's funeral oration in Book Two of The Peloponnesian War, in which the Athenian leader honors the city's fallen soldiers by evoking the cause for which they offered their lives, is obviously sincere. 
28

The war that Thucydides recounts certainly merits his judgment that in scope and importance it was "much greater than the wars which preceded it." 
31
32
The Greek world drew together to repel the Persians in the Persian Wars (490-479)-as recounted in the Histories of Herodotus, culminating with the famous battles of Marathon (490), Salamis (480) and Plataea (479). 
33
34
Thucydides's analysis of the causes of war has a strong cultural dimension. The author repeatedly refers to the differences in style, attitude, and values that divide the major belligerents. Sparta represents a distinctive variant of the oligarchic tyranny, with an agricultural economy based on the labor of a massive population of enslaved helots, and defense provided by professional warriors or Spartiates organized in elite infantry units famed for their courage and discipline. Sparta's force as a land power is justly famed-no other power in the Greek world is presumed to be capable of standing before it. Sparta also heads a loose alliance based on bilateral agreements with like-minded allies known as the Peloponnesian League. As an agrarian based oligarchy committed to traditional values and an unchallengeable land power with a status-quo geopolitical orientation, Sparta may be said to represent a conservative force in Greek life. By way of contrast, Thucydides portrays Athens as dynamic and innovative. Though like all Greek city-states its economy rests on slave labor, Athens is groundbreaking in developing democratic institutions and offers a considerable degree of empowerment to its free citizens. Its international position rests on sea power, commerce, and an empire of subject states (city-states in the Aegean, Thrace, and Asia Minor) that originally ally with Athens to resist the Persians and are organized under Athenian leadership in the Delian League in 478. Athens is culturally innovative, economically dynamic, and strategically expansive. After the construction of the long walls linking Athens to Piraeus in 450, it is also virtually invulnerable. Periclean Athens is bent on extending its power, and brash and assertive in its dealings with others.
When the city-state of Megara withdrew from the Spartan alliance and joined with Athens in 460, a First Peloponnesian War that pitted Athens and Sparta against one another as primary belligerents ensued. The war ended in 446 with a compromise known as the Thirty Years Peace, including a pledge to submit future differences to binding arbitration. Between 433 and 431, however, a series of events on the periphery of the Greek world drove the two antagonists to war once again. Thucydides's Peloponnesian War was waged from 431-404, over a span of 27 years. For purposes of simplification (the distinction is not made by Thucydides) historians generally divide the war into three phases: the Archidamian War from 431-421, named for the Spartan King Archidamus, who ironically opposed a resort to arms and sought to contain hostilities once in progress; the Peace of Nicias from 421-412, named for the Athenian general Nicias who negotiated the truce in 421 and went on to meet a tragic fate as commander of the doomed Athenian expeditionary force on Sicily; and the Ionian War from 412-404, beginning with an Athenian revival but concluding with her final defeat.
The Archidamian War unfolded as a stalemate between Spartan land power and Athenian sea power. Each side was capable of hurting its opponent, but not overthrowing it. A turning point came when Athens established a base on the Peloponnesus at the isolated outpost of Pylos, capturing several hundred elite Spartiate warriors and threatening to inspire a helot revolt. The Peace of Nicias was the result, but it did not strike deep roots. By this point the war had taken on a momentum of its own, with allies and local commanders refusing to respect ceasefires, and a war party on each side committed to pursue the conflict jusqu'au bout. Thucydides goes to some length to argue that the Peace of Nicias, which he calls a "treacherous armistice," does not divide the Peloponnesian War into two distinct parts, but rather represents an integral part of an extended conflict with a consistent strategic logic. 
35
36
Even in brief outline, the Peloponnesian War presents the observer with an extraordinarily wide variety of strategic gambits, military adventures, and political ploys. Thucydides's history includes detailed descriptions of major fleet actions, pitched battles, sieges, unconventional operations, plague, revolution, atrocity and massacre, political confrontations, instances of decisive leadership, and, in fact, virtually every kind of circumstance that shapes the outcome of major wars. The story is engrossing, but as already argued, it is not unique. What is it that makes Thucydides's account the "classical and canonical work of Western culture" that it is universally considered to be? 
37
38
The Origins of War: Identifying the causes and nature of war is a basic challenge that arguably has become more difficult in an era when declarations of war have become things of the past, when the state of war has lost much of its formal legal status, and when the United States finds itself engaged in an open-ended "war on terrorism and radical extremism" that may last for generations. Thucydides's account of the origins of the Peloponnesian War offers an interesting case study for working through these problems.
Thucydides devotes a great amount of attention to discussing the causes of the Peloponnesian War and makes a fundamental distinction, which he is sometimes said to have invented, between the immediate or short-term sources of the conflict and underlying or structural causes.

Thucydides's account does not resolve the issue of the relative importance of structural and immediate causes, nor does it seek to do so. What the text demonstrates is multiple causality.

49
Thucydides's depiction of warfare is nearly unparalleled in its intensity and power. There is no more sophisticated rendering of the complementary roles of land and sea power, the burden of command, the consequences of defeat, the impact of political faction on strategic choice, or the role of chance and circumstance in effecting strategic outcomes. Despite the best efforts of responsible leaders, momentous events continue to turn on the unpredictable and unexpected-an eclipse of the moon and bolt of thunder, cloud cover during a night attack, unidentified terrain features, or the personal foibles of leaders under stress. The Peloponnesian War is one of the greatest books ever written about the theme of war itself. But Thucydides does not just depict the face of battle. He places warfare in a grand strategic context where a multiplicity of factors must be explored to account for the difference between victory and defeat. Thucydides's appreciation for the strategic level of warfare is one of the most important, and neglected, dimensions of his work.
Thucydides depicts grand strategy as comprehensive. In great wars, everything matters and nothing is superfluous. In The Peloponnesian War, this includes such elements as: the domestic political environment (Sparta is chronically concerned with the possibility of a helot revolt, there is a constant struggle between oligarchic and democratic factions within individual city-states with serious strategic implications); economic necessity (control of commercial routes, access to strategic raw materials); pride and reputation (alliance defection becomes unacceptable because the hegemonic power will lose face); military innovation (the enhanced role of light infantry, including archers, slingers, and Thracian peltasts, as the war proceeds, the new Corinthian ramming tactics that wreck havoc with the Athenian fleet in the Great Harbor of Syracuse); geostrategy (control of maritime choke points and lines of communication); alliance stability (much of Spartan strategy consists of attacking the integrity of the Athenian alliance system); and decisive battle (the encounters at Delium, Mantinea, or Syracuse, where strategic outcomes hinge on a single day's fighting). Thucydides makes no attempt to identify a unique hub of power and movement capable of serving as a Clausewitzian Center of Gravity (even if his narrative provides plenty of material for making such an assessment retrospectively). What he depicts is an extraordinarily complex strategic environment in which victory can be a consequence of many things, some of which are virtually impossible to predict.
In addition to being comprehensive, Thucydides's strategic environment is dynamic. At the outset of the Peloponnesian War, the two major belligerents have clearly outlined strategies for waging and winning the war. Sparta's intention is to invade Attica and force the Athenians to confront their army in order to prevent the ravaging of their lands and homes. Presumably the Spartans will defeat the Athenians in a major battle between opposing hoplite armies, leaving Sparta in a position to dictate the terms of peace. Athens, led by Pericles, intends to withdraw its population from exposed rural regions and concentrate it inside the city walls, refuse battle, subsist by importing vital commodities via sea, avoid adventures, and use naval power to raid and harass the Peloponnesus. Eventually, the Athenians presume, Spartan resolve will flag, and Athens will be in a position to impose an advantageous peace. 
50
Athenian resolve is weakened by the great plague that strikes the overcrowded city in the second year of the war-a completely unforeseen event with great strategic consequences. 
51
52
This brief overview calls attention to a great diversity of strategic initiatives. Thucydides's history demonstrates that in protracted conflicts strategy must be flexible and adaptive. Security, of course, is grounded in a capacity for self-defense. The author has composed the history of a war, and his image of strategy is firmly tied to "the part which is played by force, or the threat of force, in the international system." 
53
Thucydides's History is notable for its lack of illusion. War, he remarks, is a "rough master that brings most men's characters to a level with their fortunes."

The real subject of Thucydides's history is the decline and fall of a political civilization under the strains of hegemonic warfare. Thucydides built the narrative on careful observation and detailed accounting, but the story line inexorably directs the reader's attention to the big picture, the grand strategic environment within which the decisions are made that lead to victory and defeat. What are the dynamics that cause great power war? Can they be contained, and if so, how? What kinds of policies are most conducive to the pursuit of victory? How can the various instruments of national power be combined in a coherent grand strategy? How should strategy be sustained or adapted in the course of protracted armed conflicts? What are the attributes of effective strategic leadership? How can power be linked to purpose, and justice to interest, in a balanced national strategy that sustains legitimate authority? These are the kind of questions that emerge from a careful reading of The Peloponnesian War. Thucydides does not reach the end of this history, and his text does not include a formal summary or conclusion, but he clearly intended it as a guide to statecraft and a plea for caution and moderation that is as relevant in our time as on the day it was written.  3. This is a long-standing tradition. See Gilbert Murray, Our Great War and the Great War of the Ancient Greeks, New York: Thomas Seltzer, 1920, for parallels with the First World War, or Carlos Alonso Zaldívar, "Tucídides, en Kosovo," El Pais, May 17, 1999, for applications to the war in Kosovo during 1999.  Western military studies are often dominated by the writings of Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian theorist and author of the epic On War, and Antoine Henri de Jomini, his contemporaneous Swiss counterpart and prolific author of several works on military art, including The Art of War. 
1
Close examination reveals that Clausewitz and Jomini share many assumptions and precepts, as one might expect from two similarly talented analysts who emerged from the Napoleonic campaigns of 1792-1815. They shared a conviction that war is more art than science, and also that the role of the commander is of paramount importance in exercising military art and science to bring order to the otherwise chaotic business of warfare and extended campaigning. Modern Western military doctrine and practice have absorbed these thinkers' insights and concepts; their impact on modern Western military strategy has been monumental, by any measurement.
That acknowledged, non-Western cultures have had their own theorists, and these approaches to military strategy have ardent followings of their own. Significantly, China, India, and Japan each have a robust military tradition that, in part at least, reflects the thinking of a particular military theorist. In fact, the writings of these venerable civilizations predate those of Clausewitz and Jomini by centuries. Given the global nature of modern warfare, 21st-century military commanders would be well advised to familiarize themselves with these writings in this age of coalition warfare, where potential coalition partners and possible adversaries may be grounded in strategic thinking derived from major non-Western military theorists. This is no small undertaking. From Chinese history, Sun Tzu's The Art of War is a collection of aphorisms and maxims, disjointed in presentation and only loosely connected in thematic chapters. The text was allegedly compiled in the 5th century B.C., and it has been edited, amended, and revised by commentators and subsequent theorists-some of whom are identifiable and others unknown.

Accepting that as a premise, these ancient strategists present contemporary strategists and planners a cultural lens through which to view strategic thought and campaign design. When aspects of cultures are applied to strategic issues, the refraction that occurs in that culture is, by nature, an accretion of almost imperceptible and invariably local influences. Cultural mores, norms, and folkways begin with the family and the infancy of any member of a society. It is questionable whether an outsider can ever fully appreciate the full depth and scope of a different culture unless that person has been shaped in that same crucible.

Little is known about Sun Tzu as a historical person. This is not surprising, since he was most likely born in the late Eastern Zhou Dynasty when the Zhou kings had become nominal figureheads, and China fragmented into over a hundred feudal states governed by competing warlords. Records from that period are understandably sparse. He may be entirely mythical. He is variously attributed as a citizen of the states of Wu and of Ch'i. However, enough details exist to ascertain that The Art of War probably was generated during the Warring States period in China (c. 403-221 B.C.), most likely by Sun Tzu or perhaps a knowledgeable general like him.

A Chinese army of the Warring States in battle array was an impressive spectacle as its ranks stood firm and scores of lavishly embroidered flags and banners whipped in the wind. These, decorated with figures of tigers, birds, dragons, snakes, phoenixes, and tortoises, marked the command post of the commanderin-chief behind the center and those of the assistant generals who commanded the wings. Constant maneuvering distracted the enemy and provided opportunity for ch'i [irregular or unorthodox] operations against his deep flanks and rear.

Are Sun Tzu's principles the basis for effective military strategy? Yes and no-the principles are not a sure recipe for success, but may be applied in specific military contexts. Samuel B. Griffith served in China prior to World War II, during Mao Zedong's long, ultimately successful, campaigns against Chiang Kai-shek. Griffith, who translated The Art of War, observed that both Mao and his army commander, Chu Teh, were steeped in Sun Tzu's writings. Griffith surmised that many of Mao's own writings are paraphrases or elaborations of Sun Tzu. Indeed, in several writings, Mao cited Sun Tzu directly:
When Sun Wu Tzu said in discussing military science, 'Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat,' he was referring to the two sides in a battle . . . . But our comrades often look at problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags. 
17
Mao apparently observed that Sun Tzu's precepts are readily adaptable to the conduct of war of either the hot or cold variety, and although it was many years before he had the opportunity to apply them against foreign 'imperialists,' he had not long to wait for a chance to use them with startling effect against Chiang Kai-shek in a hot one.

Chandragupta Maurya was the first leader to unify most of the Indian subcontinent in a single empire. Chandragupta turned back Alexander the Great's successors, defeated the Nanda kings, and established effective imperial rule. Kautilya, or Chanakya as he is sometimes known, was the architect of Chandragupta's rise from obscurity to empire. The Arthashastra (The Science of Politics) is Kautilya's comprehensive record of actions and advice on governing a vast empire, to include military strategy. 
21
In this state of disruption and decay, Kautilya singly envisioned a great, united nation, such as he had seen among the Greeks under Alexander. 
22
The Arthashastra, then, was a compilation of Kautilya's memoirs on how he accomplished this epic feat as well as advice to Chandragupta on how to consolidate and maintain his power. Kautilya accepted as a starting point that insecurity and instability are the dominant characteristics of the Indian environment. 
23
24
25
26
Statecraft was a key factor in the march of conquest. Kautilya framed the vijigishu's problem as a mandala, a finely patterned ring of concentric circles. The vijigishu himself was at the center. Next to him was likely to be an enemy plotting his destruction. Next to that enemy was that enemy's enemy, and the enemy of one's enemy is a friend. Of course, once the extant enemy was disposed of, the problem was reframed because the former ally became a probable enemy. In this everthreatening situation, peace was preferable to war only insofar as it bought time to recover from a weak position. It was a temporary expedient, and conquest should resume as soon as it is practical, whether by open warfare, preemptive surprise strikes, or secret sabotage. 
27
28
Nothing, then, was beneath a potentate's attention. Internal administration of the kingdom was as important as foreign relations, since the resources to conduct conquest must first be controlled and developed. Hence, The Arthashastra covered subjects as diverse as how to manage forests (forests harbor elephants, and elephants are useful for war), how Indian society functioned, income from crown property, types and purposes of marriages, how to plan a campaign, and how to treat a subjugated population. The Arthashastra is one of the earliest and most complete treatments of holistic strategic-level leadership in existence. It is also one of the most single-minded works of its kind. Every resource, every element of national power, every waking moment of a ruler's days, should be spent with one intent: hegemonic conquest.
The question arises: Does The Arthashastra represent current 21st-century thinking of leaders on the Indian subcontinent? Some authors believe Kautilya's counsel resonates even today with Indian national leaders, as it did for Chandragupta. They hold that the common understanding of Indian culture as nonviolent and peace loving is a Western myth. Military historian Robert Leckie reminded us that the form of nonviolent civil disobedience practiced by Mahatma Gandhi against the British and Portuguese in the mid-20th century that became the archetypical image of Indian action is largely misinterpreted.
When Gandhian nonviolence was employed for the 'passive invasion' of Goa, that is, an offensive march by unarmed people, the applauding pacifists did not seem to understand that they were cheering another form of coercion. 'Passive resistance' may be nonviolent, but so are other successful forms of coercion such as excommunication, ostracism or economic boycott.

In contrast to Sun Tzu's aphoristic approach to strategic planning and to Kautilya's broad, whole-of-monarchy nesting of all elements of national power, Miyamoto Musashi's "two swords" approach presented in Go Rin No Sho, or The Book of Five Rings, is directly operational and focused rather pointedly on direct approaches to combat operations. Of the three theorists, he most closely reflects Clausewitz's emphasis on center of gravity.
Musashi was born into a minor samurai family in 1545. This period was one of great change following centuries of civil unrest and warfare. After the death of Emperor Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu established pervasive autocratic rule as shogun of Japan. Musashi participated in the great battle of Sekigahara in 1600 that established Ieyasu as shogun and dwarfed any contemporary military action in Europe. This epic battle involved an estimated 60,000 matchlocks, at a time when only 3,000 such firearms existed in the entire French army. 
34
In 1643, after a legendary life in which he fought over 60 duels without a defeat, Musashi retired to a cave on Kyushu Island. He completed The Book of Five Rings shortly before his death there in 1645. Compared to the writings of Sun Tzu and Kautilya, The Book of Five Rings is far less acces-sible. It was, foremost, not so much a book of strategy as guidance on how to think strategically. Secondly, it took the form of a broadly conceived allegory. Musashi wrote as if he were crafting a fencing manual, but his broad conceptual intent was to create a strategic treatise. Musashi stated this openly, "The principles of strategy are written down here in terms of single combat, but you must think broadly so that you attain an understanding for ten-thousand-a-side battles." 
35
36
The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike, or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking, or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him. More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him. You must thoroughly research this.

It is perhaps too easy to equate familiarity with these ancient writers with discipleship and authority. It is a quick-thought exercise to link Chandragupta's rise with Kautilya's advice, but it is a far longer stretch to tie Napoleon's operational art to Sun Tzu's maxims, and Curtis LeMay undoubtedly never read The Book of Five Rings. The terse, bulletized methodology of the non-Western writings makes them too prone to reinterpretation and misapplication by modern strategists and planners, who often advocate their own convictions by reference (often somewhat forced) to these military philosophers. 
49
These three Eastern military philosophers represent variant forms of thought, bounded by culture and appearing in differing historical contexts. In contrast to Clausewitz and Jomini, whose strategic thinking came into being in a single period in a specific theater (and was even dominated by a single commander in the person of Napoleon), conceptualizations of military art from ancient China and India and shogun-era Japan present both distinct contrasts as well as interesting convergences. However, the disparity in their writings makes them hard to link together in a coherent way.
Of course, one could claim the same about Clausewitz and Jomini. However, at least these two theorists are acknowledged as authorities with a tradition of inclusion in Western military thought. In practice, one suspects that while Sun Tzu, Kautilya, and Musashi may appear on many recommended reading lists, American strategists seldom actually read them and, even more rarely, seriously study them. Perhaps unfortunately, it is mainly among practitioners from their own cultures that these writers are likely to develop a following. Cultural patterns make Western military educations predisposed to follow the precepts of Clausewitz and Jomini, as those theorists align best with our history. It is a good bet, however, that professional military education in other cultures will rely on local traditions and history. An Indian general may have studied Kautilya to a greater degree than he has Jomini, and a Japanese officer may be more steeped in Sun Tzu and Musashi than his Western counterpart.
As a global power, the United States has its own military traditions and arguably a uniquely American way of war, and those approaches may be more useful in the 21st century than attempting to implement the doctrines of foreign strategists who have been dead for over a millennium. However, the global interconnectivity of the 21st century makes it certain that Americans will interact with other cultures, whether as allies, adversaries, or perhaps over time, both. Each culture will have developed along far different historical paths, and close study of the foundation documents of these other cultures can prove useful, if not vital, to U.S. warfighting efforts. Aside from a few familiar quotations from Sun Tzu, these Eastern military philosophers are largely unheralded outside of their own cultures. They are not incorporated into U.S. professional military education or ongoing adaptive strategic planning, whether for deliberate contingency planning or emergent crisis response.
This unfamiliarity is unfortunately shortsighted, and quite possibly strategically dangerous. Cross-cultural understanding is always difficult to reach and often takes both time and serious effort to gain. Indeed, one may never progress beyond a modicum of cross-cultural awareness and never progress to comprehension with any degree of real depth. Given that difficulty, decades may be necessary to inculcate an understanding of Eastern thinking into future American strategic decisionmakers. In developing future strategies and plans, the current state of world affairs need not remain constant. Quite possibly, given the globalized nature of human endeavor in the 21st century, it cannot remain constant. Prudent preparedness suggests that more attention to non-Western cultural traditions in military strategy is a way of mitigating the risks of such uncertainty.
Warfare remains a function largely of the human mind and heart. Students of military art would do well to consider the import of these three ancient theorists when framing their own operational problems-and designing approaches to solve them-within a cultural context that may be alien to them. That perspective is one that all three of these strategic thinkers-along with Clausewitz and Jomini, no doubt-would espouse.
Power is an essential concept in international theory, but also an essentially contested and chronically ambiguous one. 
1
The scope of what is considered legitimate behavior is thereby reduced-what does not happen is as important as what does. In this framework, power implies securing compliance by leveraging influence and authority.

On the international level, different priorities prevail. The classic realist vision of international order rests on the assertion that the modern state system (the so-called Westphalian state system) is defined first of all by the absence of any effective supranational authority. It is an anarchic, selfhelp system in which sovereign states must act without recourse to institutions of world governance to confront "the conflicts of interests that inevitably arise among similar units in a condition of anarchy."

Power is the measure of a relationship. It has no objective stature in and of itself and can be manifested in many ways. It is not a fungible commodity. The combination of power resources required to accomplish Task A, can be completely different from the combination required to address Task B. Physical strength, for example, will be a useful facilitator for positive outcomes in some contingencies (a wrestling match) but altogether irrelevant in others (a chess contest). Morgenthau defines power as "man's control over the minds and actions of other men" and "a psychological relation between those who exercise it and those over whom it is exercised," 
12
Modern policy analysis has been predisposed to emphasize the primacy of national security as a motive for state behavior and the essential role of military power as the guarantor of national survival and state interests. There is no doubt that in the modern centuries military power has been the most important arbiter in relations between states. But superior military capacity has never been a sufficient condition for achieving successful outcomes in international competition. Military strength is only one dimension of what are sometimes referred to as hard power assets: the capacity to coerce, including both the threat of and resort to armed force; economic pressure including fiscal and commercial sanctions; subversive techniques; and, various other forms of intimidation. Moreover, the capacity of states to develop and sustain military capacity rests on a more complex combination of power attributes, including economic, organizational and motivational assets.
Military power has always been employed as one of several tools of statecraft. Edward Gullick notes that in the age of the classic European balance of power, the calculus of power rested on the diverse mechanisms of alliance, coalition, and compensation, with resort to arms or warfare as a popular but also last resort.

Beginning with the publication of Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye's Power and Interdependence in 1977, there has been an ongoing effort by international relations scholars to develop a more nuanced view of the concept of power in international relations that breaks with some of the core assumptions of the realist paradigm. In the interdependent world of the late-20th century, Keohane and Nye argued, the relative importance of military power as an instrument of statecraft is in decline. Survival remains the primordial national goal, and force is still the ultimate guarantor of security. But in a more interdependent world, relationships of mutual dependence bind countries more closely together, and "in most of them force is irrelevant or unimportant as an instrument of policy."

National power is constituted on a number of distinct levels: (1) physical resources and attributes (latent power); (2) the effectiveness of national institutions in mobilizing, sustaining, and applying the instruments of power (applied power); and (3) the structural context (facilitators or constraints on the application of power derived from the international environment). The ultimate measure of effective national power should be outcomes or performance. Measuring outcomes, however, depends on the strategic setting-the ends toward which national power is being directed, or "power over whom, and with respect to what?" 25
The physical attributes of national power include human resources (population), agricultural potential and the endowment of strategic resources, productive capacity, and geostrategic characteristics.
From the military revolution of the early-modern centuries to the present, powerful states have required a population base sufficient to raise and sustain strategically competitive mass armies. Large populations also contribute to greater productive power and a larger gross domestic product (GDP), a basic measure of economic strength. Indeed, it is virtually impossible to imagine a state rising into the ranks of the great world powers without a significant population base. The United States' ability to attract and assimilate large immigrant populations, and to sustain demographic growth, has been a meaningful source of national power. Demographic decline in the European Union (EU) and Russian Federation threaten their capacity to function as great powers in the long term. But large impoverished populations can also place constraints on development and the mobilization of strategic power. Contemporary China presents the example of a rising power that is committed to what some consider a draconian policy of limiting population growth. Size matters, but there is no direct correlation between the size of a country's population and its underlying national strength.
Agricultural potential and the endowment of strategic raw materials can also be critical facilitators of national power. All things being equal, nations with the capacity to feed themselves have a strategic advantage over competitors who are dependent on imports. Historically, its great agricultural potential has been a significant source of U.S. strength. Strategic raw materials can also provide a foundation for economic and military power. Oil-rich states such as Saudi Arabia carry weight beyond their inherent capacity specifically because of the degree to which they control access to a vital strategic resource. The dramatic revival of the Russian Federation over the past decade, driven by a tenfold increase in the price of oil and natural gas on world markets between 1998 and 2008, is a clear example of how a raw material endowment can be translated into strategic power. Conversely, dependence on foreign sources of supply for vital resources can place states at a competitive disadvantage unless compensated for by special diplomatic or commercial arrangements. Like other potential pillars of national power, however, control of vital raw materials does not translate directly into strategic leverage. A raw material endowment can also be squandered due to lack of technological expertise, corruption and disreputable political direction, or insufficient social discipline-the modern world offers many examples. The nature of strategic resources also changes over time in tandem with technological development. Salt and ship timbers were once considered to be strategic raw materials on a par with hydrocarbon reserves today. In the near future environmental pressures may make access to fresh water resources a vital national interest as well-with considerable implications for the global balance of power.
Industrial capacity was once considered to be the bedrock of national power. It was the foundation of Britain's preeminence as a European great power and global empire all through the 19th century. The stage was set for the First World War by the power transition implicit in the relative decline of France as an industrial power and the rise of Germany as the continent's leading center of industrial production. The United States assumed the mantle of leadership in the productive sector at the same time that it was supplanting the United Kingdom as the leading world power, and its stature as the "arsenal of democracy" was a key to victory in the 20th century's most destructive industrial war. 
26
27
Resources are the raw material of national power. They must be translated into applied power to be relevant to the pursuit of national goals. The degree of efficiency that states bring to the task of converting latent power into applied power is determined by political, social, and organizational interactions. The stability and effectiveness of governing institutions, economic performance, aptitude for innovation, educational standards, social structure, organizational proficiency, and reputation are more difficult to quantify than the resource endowment, but arguably no less important as foundations for national policy.
Military strength is the classic foundation of national power. It can be quantified rather handily using national defense budgets and militarily related expenditures as a comparative measure. Currently the U.S. defense budget represents 46 percent of global military spending-larger than the next 168 countries combined and approximately ten times greater than the nearest competitors (China, Japan, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, each with between 4 and 5 percent of the global total). 
28
29
Globalization, understood as a process of enhanced international interdependence and space/ time compression driven by technological change, has changed the nature of economic power. GDP and GDP per capita remain valid measures of overall economic strength. The World Bank's categorization of low-, middle-, and high-income countries (representing 60 percent, 25 percent, and 15 percent of the world population, respectively) provides a fair global index of relative economic power. 
30
31
32
33
The strength of governing institutions and effectiveness of the policy process can also enhance or inhibit the application of national power. Different kinds of governments can accomplish these tasks in various ways. Authoritarian regimes usually lack popular legitimacy, but can be adept at imposing coherent national strategies and pursuing them consistently over time. But authoritarian leaders can also become isolated by in-groups of sycophantic courtiers and denied the kind of realistic appraisals that are required for intelligent strategic choices-as seems to have been the case, for example, with Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Democratic polities must construct policy by consensus building and persuasion, and vet it through a complex decisionmaking process, with a certain degree of incoherence an almost inevitable result. It is usually more difficult for democratic states to build and sustain a national consensus on strategic options and to shift course rapidly in the face of changed international circumstances. Nonetheless, a state with respected and legitimate institutions grounded in popular consensus, and capable of mobilizing its population to accept sacrifices in the face of real threats to national well being, will be inherently stronger, often in subtle ways, than an authoritarian polity imposed and sustained by force.
The policy process itself can become an independent variable. Improved strategic education and professional development for civil servants working in the national security sector, better coordination between government agencies, and more adept management can arguably lead toward more effective strategic choices. Coordinating the varied instruments of national power, including diplomatic, intelligence, informational, and legal tools, demands professional insight and an efficient decisionmaking environment within which ideas can be exchanged freely and alternative courses of action considered on their merits.
The ability to apply power effectively also depends on social cohesion and the degree to which a country is regarded as an honorable and trustworthy member of the community of nations. National values, political stability, an active and engaged citizenry and dynamic civil society, and international reputation can all be meaningful sources of national power. If states are convinced that the ideals and priorities of a potential rival are sincere and worthy of respect, they are more likely to opt for policies of accommodation that acknowledge mutual interests. This is the case along a continuum stretching from bilateral relations to systemic competition. Hegemonic powers cannot sustain their position on the basis of coercive strategies alone-they must construct a framework of authority and system of values to which subordinate states accord voluntary acquiescence-the "power over" accorded by non-material sources of national power. Dysfunctional or rogue states that fail to cultivate this kind of cohesion or flout the normative context within which interstate relations are conducted will inevitably pay a price.
In the classic statement of the philosophy that might makes right, Thucydides's Athenians tell their Melian interlocutors that "right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must." 
34
35
36
National power is contextual and relational in the sense that it can only be measured in the context of a particular pattern of interstate relations and against the capacities of other national and non-state actors. The constantly evolving nature of threats to national well-being must also be taken into account. These are dynamic variables-the power equation in international relations is never stable, and the substance of national power is constantly changing. What are the most salient characteristics of the current international system, and the most significant trends working to transform it? How is systemic transformation affecting the structure of threats against which states are required to maneuver? These kinds of dynamic factors, embedded in the mechanisms of international society, will affect the ways in which national power is configured, conceptualized, and realized.
Globalization pushes toward the diminution of de facto state sovereignty. The diffusion of technology has made the effort to maintain an effective non-proliferation regime appear increasingly quixotic. As access to weapons of mass destruction becomes more widespread, including potentially to terrorist and extremist organizations, even the most comprehensively armed states will find themselves increasingly exposed. The phenomenon of global migration has strained the ability of states to maintain physical control over their borders, once considered the most basic attribute of sovereignty. The revolution in information technology has shattered the state's monopoly over certain kinds of information, and created new and powerful channels of communication across borders. It has also enabled the global market, which can now react to economic stimuli with a speed and flexibility that states cannot rival or control. A variety of non-state actors (multinational corporations; non-governmental organizations [NGO], such as Amnesty International or Oxfam International; multilateral forums, such as the International Monetary Fund [IMF], the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [NATO], or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization [SCO]; regional economic associations, such as the EU or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]) now rival states in an effort to "set the agenda" and impose priorities in world politics. Some argue that the most critical challenges confronting the international community-the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and effects; environmental disintegration; impoverishment and economic marginalization; the threat of pandemic disease; trans-boundary crime, including drug and human trafficking; terrorism; low intensity conflict, sometimes extending to the level of genocidal violence produced by dysfunctional regional orders and failing states; traditional mass casualty events; and, cyberterrorism-can no longer be confronted by nation-states acting in isolation. Global threats that transcend the capacity of individual states, no matter how powerful, have become more important. 
37
38
How does globalization impact on the configuration of national power? On the international level, power has become more diffused, and states are no longer its unique proprietor. The leverage available to various kinds of non-state actors and their ability to shape and affect the power of states has become more significant. In discrete areas such as human rights and international humanitarian law, environmental policy, and humanitarian assistance, NGOs have been successful in imposing frameworks for international action that on some level states are obliged to respect. The Ottawa Treaty and Kyoto Protocol are only two examples. The diffusion of information through the worldwide net and a proliferation of "virtual networks" tying people together across borders in what some have called a nascent "international civil society" have eroded states' capacity to dominate the dissemination of ideas and sustain control through compliance.
The nature of national security, the fundamental challenge of traditional statecraft, is also changing. The physical attributes of national power, including territory, population, and resources, remain salient. But in an age of increased international interconnectedness and interdependence the Westphalian premise of territoriality has lost some of its force-control over terrain is no longer the kind of driver in international political competition that it once was. Even the largest and inherently most powerful states confront new and unfamiliar kinds of vulnerabilities for which the traditional instruments of national security policy are not always well suited.
Conventional military power has lost at least some of its centrality. Traditional conceptions of the role of military power emphasize the forceful defense of borders and the containment of threats to national integrity posed by "Napoleonic neighbors" and armed adversaries. But traditional military priorities are less well adapted to confront the new threat structure emerging in an age of "sacred terror" and new kinds of existential concerns. The security problem has become more complex and multidimensional. In his seminal People, States and War, first published in 1983, Barry  Buzan spoke of military, political, economic, societal, and ecological security as diverse facets of a broader security equation. 
39
40
41
It is still possible to draw up an approximate index of national power using quantitative measures such as population, territory, resource base, GDP, defense spending, average educational attainment, per capita expenditure on research and development, and the like. A recent study sponsored by the National Security Research Division of the RAND Corporation uses a basket of such metrics to calculate that the U.S. holds about 20 percent of total global power, compared with 14 percent each for the EU and China, and 9 percent for India. 
42
It is generally accepted in the U.S. Government today that information is an element of national power along with diplomatic, military, and economic power, and that information is woven through the other elements, since their activities will have an informational impact.

Before addressing strategic communication as a U.S. Government process, it is important to consider the complex environment in which that process occurs. Consequently, the information environment is initially covered in some detail, including a description of "new media" capabilities and their impact. Information as power is both colored and informed in the psyche of Americans through the historical lens of "propaganda," and so it is also addressed in this section. With this foundational knowledge established, strategic communication is then considered from historical and current perspectives. Finally, recognizing both challenges and opportunities, a way-ahead is offered for future U.S. Government efforts to wield information effectively as power.
The current information environment has leveled the playing field for not only nation-states but non-state actors, multinational corporations, and even individuals to affect strategic outcomes with minimal information infrastructure and little capital expenditure. Anyone with a camera cell phone and personal digital device with Internet capability understands this. On the other hand, the U.S. military has increasingly leveraged advances in information infrastructure and technology to gain advantages on the modern battlefield. One example from Operation IRAQI FREEDOM is the significant increase in situational awareness from network-centric operations that enabled coalition forces to swiftly defeat Iraqi forces in major combat operations. 
4
Even a cursory look at advances in technology confirms what most people recognize as a result of their daily routine. The ability to access, collect, and transmit information is clearly decentralized to the lowest level (the individual). The technology is increasingly smaller, faster, and cheaper. Consequently, the ability to control and verify information is much more limited than in the recent past-nor will it get any easier:
In 1965, the physical chemist Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated chip would double every 18 months. Moore predicted that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. Moore and most other experts expect Moore's Law to remain valid for at least another 2 decades. 
5
The Internet.
The Internet is the obvious start point for any discussion of the impact of today's new media. It is important to note that the World Wide Web is essentially ungoverned, providing obvious freedoms and cautions. The Web gives the individual a voice, often an anonymous voice, and a potentially vast audience. Websites are easily established, dismantled, and reestablished, making them valuable to extremist movements. Terrorists routinely use the Internet for propaganda, recruiting, training, cybercrime, and fund raising.

The Internet clearly is part of the new media phenomenon, but the Internet has not penetrated large areas of the world, especially in the poorest areas of underdeveloped countries. The cell phone, however, as a means of mobile technology, is increasingly available worldwide and deserves discussion as a potentially powerful capability to affect national security and military issues-arguably even more so than the internet.
There are numerous examples of cell phone Short Message Service (SMS text) messaging shaping political campaigns by mobilizing and revolutionizing politics. As previously discussed, it also is used both to call people to popular protests as well as by governments to provide information or misinformation in order to quell such protests. Combine this with the viral nature of social networking sites, and the impact can be significant. Text messaging is the medium of choice in overseas countries. It bypasses mass media and mobilizes an already persuaded populace as a means of lightweight engagement. Cell phones contain the technology to text, provide news, video, sound, voice, radio, and Internet. The number of mobile subscriptions worldwide was scheduled to pass 5 billion in 2010. Recognizing the power of mobile technology, the Obama administration released the President's Cairo speech to the Muslim world in 13 languages over text message. 
16

Mainstream media certainly takes advantage of technological advances in order to remain competitive. Marvin Kalb in the Harvard Report on the Israeli-Hezbollah War of 2006 (the "Second Lebanon War") notes that:
To do their jobs, journalists employed both the camera and the computer and with the help of portable satellite dishes and video phones 'streamed' or broadcast their reports . . ., as they covered the movement of troops and the rocketing of villages-often, (unintentionally, one assumes) revealing sensitive information to the enemy. Once upon a time, such information was the stuff of military intelligence acquired with considerable effort and risk; now it has become the stuff of everyday journalism. The camera and the computer have become weapons of war. 
19
20
21
22
Of course, in an environment where the speed of breaking news means viewership and thus advertising dollars, accuracy is sometimes sacrificed as well. In a strange twist, mainstream media now turns increasingly to bloggers for their stories, and the most respected bloggers require multiple sources to verify accuracy.

Until recently, propaganda was described by the U.S. Government as "any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly."

The executive branch of the U.S. Government has the responsibility to develop and sustain an information strategy that ensures that strategic communication occurs consistent with and in support of policy development and implementation. This strategy should guide and direct information activities across the geostrategic environment. Effective strategic communication supports the national security strategy by identifying and responding to strategic threats and opportunities with information-related activities. It is focused U.S. Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of U.S. Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power,

Public Affairs within the DoD is defined as "those public information, command information, and community relations activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department. . . ."

Strategists use a model of "ends, ways, and means" to describe all aspects of a national or military strategy. Strategy is about how (the way) leaders will use the capabilities (means) available to achieve objectives (ends).

Messages are certainly sent by verbal and visual communications means, but they are also sent by actions. (Note that the definition specifically includes "actions.") In fact, senior officials point out that strategic communication is "80% actions and 20% words."

While "strategic communication" is a fairly new term in the U.S. Government lexicon, the concept, theory, and practice behind it is not. Winfield Scott recognized the importance of strategic communication at the theater level at Veracruz, Mexico, in 1847. Realizing the influence of the Catholic Church on Mexican society, Scott attended Mass with his staff at the Veracruz Cathedral to display the respect of U.S. forces. He further ordered U.S. Soldiers to salute Mexican priests in the streets. Each of these measures was "part of a calculated campaign to win the friendship of the Mexicans."

The CPI's domestic efforts during the war met with high success: Draft registration-the first since the tumultuous call-up of the Civil War-occurred peacefully, bond drives were oversubscribed, and the American population was generally behind the war effort. CPI operations in foreign capitals enabled Wilson to relate his war ideals and aims to the world audience. Indeed, Wilson was taken aback by this effective dissemination of his peace aims and the world's reaction to it. He remarked to George Creel in December 1918, "I am wondering whether you have not unconsciously spun a net for me from which there is no escape."

43
There were several significant differences between the the OWI and its CPI predecessor of 23 years earlier. Some of these were by design, but others reflected the style of the President. Franklin Roosevelt was highly adept at communicating to the public, doing so directly over radio via his addresses and "Fireside Chats." In 1941, 60 million radio receivers reached 90 percent of the U.S. population in their homes. 
44
Operating in the absence of such policy guidance the OWI staff, particularly in the Foreign Branch, sometimes got out ahead of stated government pronouncements, or it responded with what its members thought American policy should be. Some OWI techniques came under very pointed criticism. The use of pseudonyms by some OWI authors in their articles was denounced by prominent newspapermen, such as Arthur Krock of The New York Times. The New York World Telegram said the practice "smells of dishonesty." 
45
The Smith-Mundt Act (1948) (formally, "The U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act" [Public Law 402; 80th Congress]), established a statutory information agency for the first time during a period of peace, with a mission to "promote a better understanding of the United States in other countries and to increase mutual understanding" between Americans and foreigners. The act also forbade the Voice of America to transmit to an American audience (based on the experiences of the World Wars). It is worth noting that Smith-Mundt is often cited today as the basis to limit the use of government information activities, since they may result in propagandizing the American public. This, of course, is complicated by the inevitable "blowback" or "bleedover" of foreign influence activities based on the global information environment, as previously described. 
46
A 1998 State Department reorganization occurred in response to calls by some to reduce the size of the U.S. foreign affairs establishment. (This is considered the State Department's " peace dividend" following the Cold War.) The act folded the USIA into the DoS. It pulled the Broadcasting Board of Governors out of the USIA and made it a separate organization. The USIA slots were distributed throughout the State Department, and its mission was given to the Bureau of International Information Programs.
The demise of the USIA is often regarded (in retrospect) as diluting the ability of the United States to effectively promulgate a national communication strategy, coordinate and integrate strategic themes and messages, and support public diplomacy efforts worldwide.

The Obama administration's efforts to advance strategic communication appear to be reaching a steady state as of this writing. While the national strategy developed under the previous administration is no longer an active document, President Obama has issued a "National Framework for Strategic Communication" in response to a congressional requirement. While not a strategy per se, this document provides the first U.S. Government definition of strategic communication and outlines the organizations and processes to implement it at the national level. A Global Engagement and Strategic Communication Interagency Policy Committee was initially active but has recently become dormant-with a shift of focus on very specific and localized grass-roots efforts to combat violent extremism overseas. In light of this shift, a Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communication (CSCC) was formally codified by Presidential Executive Order to: coordinate, orient, and inform Government-wide public communications activities directed at audiences abroad and targeted against violent extremists and terrorist organizations, especially al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents, with the goal of using communication tools to reduce radicalization by terrorists and extremist violence and terrorism that threaten the interests and national security of the United States.

The current information environment, the American attitude toward propaganda, bureaucratic processes that are-by their very nature-cumbersome and slow, all combine to make effective strategic communication difficult indeed, but not impossible. Along with the challenges are opportunities. Overcoming the challenges while exploiting the opportunities, however, requires procedural and cultural change and the leadership necessary to force that change.
Procedurally, the United States must approach strategic communication as an integral part of policy development. To do otherwise will doom the United States to always remain on the defensive in an effort to gain trust and credibility-and that certainly has not worked well to date. Incorporation of such a plan in the policy development process allows for both cautions to policy developers regarding potentially negative foreign reactions and the proactive ability to explain the policy with messages to all audiences. On the other hand, understand that poor policy will not be salvaged by any messages or themes that attempt to explain it. ("You can put a lot of lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig." 
53 )
Winning hearts, minds, trust, and credibility, in the end, requires a local approach. Consider a major U.S. metropolitan area. Neighborhoods take on their own personalities driven by socioeconomic factors and ethnic and racial identity, among other considerations. Value sets are different among the diversity of communities that make up the melting pot that is a large U.S. city. It should not be difficult, then, to understand how it is nearly impossible to influence perceptions among audiences in a foreign nation with a "one size fits all" set of messages and actions. Long-term U.S. presence and engagement on the ground in foreign nations allows for a deep understanding of cultural differences within communities. These cultural underpinnings, combined with the hard work of relationship building, allow for effective tailoring of messages and successful identification of key influencers. Engagement is the key, whether it is by U.S. soldiers in their area of operations, 
54
The National Framework for Strategic Communication notes that "every action that the United States Government takes sends a message." The U.S. hospital ship Mercy completed a 5-month humanitarian mission to South and Southeast Asia, resulting in improved public opinion of the United States in those predominately Muslim nations where the missions took place. Similar increases in favorability ratings occurred following the U.S. response to the Indonesian tsunami and Pakistani earthquake. 
55
Countering the inherent national aversion to the inflammatory term "propaganda" again lies in both process and culture driven by leadership. A U.S. Government organization paying to have articles printed (under Iraqi pseudonyms) in Iraqi newspapers, regardless of whether it is ultimately found to be legal, is simply asking for trouble in today's information environment. Supporting the government of Iraq to tell its own story is a better way to go. Leading from the rear in the information environment still gets the message told while avoiding direct confrontations with democratic ideals. On the other hand, an "Office of Strategic Influence" had the potential to provide focus, resources, and potentially significant results; but a few misguided articles in the mainstream press were all it took to bring about its quick demise. So, ultimately countering American angst over perceptions of propaganda requires strong national leadership. National leaders must admit that the United States actually does want to (truthfully) influence foreign audiences. To do anything less abrogates the information environment to our adversaries. Attempts to influence foreign audi-ences, however, will almost certainly produce some bleed over to American audiences. That must be accepted and, with knowledge of forethought, preparations must be made to both educate the media proactively regarding information efforts and to respond to any potential media backlash. The recent initiatives to incorporate strategic communication into the policy development process as previously described are encouraging in this regard.
The National Framework for Strategic Communication appears to be a step in the right direction to allow the United States to compete in the information environment and proactively tell its story. Defeating an enemy whose center of gravity is extremist ideology requires nothing less than an all-out effort in this regard. But changing perceptions, attitudes, and ultimately behavior is a generational endeavor. It remains to be seen whether processes can be adopted that endure beyond political cycles, and whether national leadership can step forward to lead a charge to change the current culture of reticence to apply information as power while competing in an increasingly challenging information environment. Only then can the information battlefield be leveled and the battle of ideas won.
A diplomat is an honest man sent abroad to lie for his country.
The patriotic art of lying for one's country.
Ambrose Bierce

Ordinary Americans have often been uncomfortable about the art and practice of diplomacy. Frequently, they associate diplomacy and American diplomats either with elitist, pseudo-aristocratic bowing and scraping before supercilious foreigners whose aim is to impinge on our sovereignty and partake of our largesse; or as naïve country bumpkins whose gullibility allows them to forsake key American goals and objectives; or as ruthless, cynical practitioners of Bismarckian realpolitiek whose aims and practices fall far short of our Founders' noble aspirations; or as liberal, one-worldists whose collective ideology is far from the American mainstream and who seek to undermine the political aims of elected administrations. These stereotypes go back to our country's origins and have been reinforced by such traumatic events as Wilson's perceived failure at Versailles, the Yalta Conference near the end of World War II, Henry Kissinger's role as architect of the opening to China, and the failure to obtain a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the use of force in Iraq.
Is any of this true? True or not, does it matter? What is diplomacy supposed to do? Does the U.S. wield diplomacy effectively? Can democracy and diplomacy function harmoniously? How does diplomacy fit in with the protection and furtherance of national security?
First, diplomacy is one instrument among many that a government utilizes in its pursuit of the national interest. Among others are: military power, actual or potential; economic power; intelligence-gathering and operations; cultural and information or "soft power"; relative degrees of national unity; and probably others. Diplomacy never functions in isolation from the other instruments of power but may at times be emphasized as the situation warrants. In its simplest, most original form, diplomacy is the official means by which one state formally relates to other states. Although ambassadors have existed since antiquity representing one sovereign to another, the earliest diplomats often functioned more as de facto hostages to ensure peace or compliance with some agreement than in the modern understanding of an ambassador's role. Since nation-states were more or less legitimized by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, a whole series of codes and protocols have been established to create a framework for the practice of diplomacy. These include such seeming anomalies (and irritants to common citizens) as diplomatic immunity; creation of embassies; establishing and breaking diplomatic relations; sending and receiving diplomatic notes, demarches, non-papers and other forms of communication; holding international conferences; and many other means of inter-state communication and relations.
Diplomats are agents of the State. In theory, they act on instruction. Until the advent of modern communications, their instructions necessarily had to be general; they required a nearly innate understanding of the national interest of the country they represented. Both because of the non-democratic nature of nearly all States before the American and French Revolutions, and the need for confidentiality to protect state secrets and national security, diplomatic exchanges and even treaties or agreements were often undertaken in secret or with quiet discretion. When Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points called for "open covenants openly arrived at" (a reference to Allied agreements for post-World War I division of spoils from the Central Powers that appeared to make a mockery of claims the War was meant to make the "world safe for democracy"), he was publicly challenging the entire edifice of traditional diplomacy that had, however, begun to be modified with the rise of the mass media and popular participation in the 19th century. Increasingly, mounting scrutiny from democratic media and academics and ever-increasing intrusive clandestine intelligence-gathering make formal secret agreements less and less palatable.
One prism through which to view diplomacy is to think of it as an element on the spectrum of national security devices. In the "normal" course of events, most nations most of the time while competing for influence, markets, relative perceived power, and other markers of strength, relate to one another the way competitors do in seeking market-share-not as gangs fighting over turf. In other words, the assumption is that peaceful approaches, use of agreements and treaties, and normal intercourse will prevail. In this scenario, diplomacy provides the lubricant for acceptable relations, seeks to remove irritants, and strives for mutual understanding. However, even in the relations between traditionally peaceful entities-in the semi-Hobbesian universe of contemporary international relations-diplomacy holds in its quiver, the potential threat of force. In the cases where rivalry becomes equated with threats to vital national interests (a determination that is difficult to define objectively, but that governments make drawing on their specific cultural, historical, and political traditions and bringing to bear whatever institutions or individuals wield predominant influence on this subject), diplomacy becomes an adjunct to overt or masked displays or use of armed force. In this situation, diplomacy becomes the main instrument to build coalitions, influence publics and elites in other countries of the justice of the cause, and works closely with the military establishment to make available critical spaces in non-national territory for the possible deployment of armed force (i.e. aircraft overflight rights, port visits, shipment of men and materiel). Finally, if armed conflict does erupt, diplomacy continues during that period (albeit with a lower emphasis) focusing on post-war planning, cost and burden-sharing, and international organization endorsement (or at least non-condemnation) of the military actions.
Diplomacy fundamentally consists of a constant assessment of other countries' power potential, perceived vital interests, and relationships with other states, in an attempt to maximize one's own country's freedom of action with the ultimate purpose of ensuring the achievement of the nation's vital interests-the core of which is survival. Diplomacy traditionally and currently utilizes a variety of practices or maneuvers to obtain the protection or furtherance of national goals or interests. Essentially all these practices are elements of diplomatic strategy that seek advantage for the state short of war (although war always remains the ultimate recourse). From the realist perspective, all strategies, while perhaps amoral in themselves, have as the ultimate goal the moral aim of the survival of the state and its core values. Thus, leaders must take account of the particular circumstance of the place of their state in the international order to determine what would be an effective strategy and tactics or maneuvers to enable its success. Thus, from the British and French perspective in 1938, the decision to appease Germany over the Sudetenland may have been a mispercep-tion of the relative power of each state but was not, a priori, an invalid tactic. The constant politically charged accusation of "Munich" or "Yalta" in quite different circumstances is meaningless. Sometimes appeasement is good or unavoidable. In the case of Nazi Germany, in hindsight, it was a bad tactic, because Hitler could not be appeased, and the Allies simply postponed the inevitable clash to a moment when they yielded military advantage to Hitler. Détente (especially the series of arms control and human rights agreements) as practiced by Nixon and Kissinger was an effort to reach accommodation with the Soviet Union at a time when it appeared a balance of power in nuclear weapons had been struck and neither side could expect to gain a decisive advantage. The effort by President George H.W. Bush to create a coalition in the First Gulf War was not so much to increase U.S. military advantage over Iraq as it was to demonstrate-especially in the Arab and Islamic worlds-the broad support to repel Iraqi aggression in Kuwait. In the recent Gulf War, the relative absence of a significant coalition was largely a function of the Administration's desire to not be constrained in tactics, operations (targeting), and strategy in the way it believed NATO operations in Kosovo had been hampered.
The main instrument of diplomacy is negotiation, whether in a formal or informal setting. In a sense all diplomacy is a constant adjustment of relations among states pursued simultaneously through multiple, overlapping dialogues: bilateral, multilateral (e.g., United Nations); special conferences; and other venues. The goal is usually, but not always, to reach an agreement that could range from those containing significant enforcement mechanisms for implementation (e.g., the Non-Proliferation Treaty) to hortatory proclamations such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which purported to outlaw war. One of the special advantages diplomats as a profession may have is that they should possess significant knowledge of the personalities and national cultural styles of their interlocutors. Since much diplomatic maneuvering by states consists of bluffs and feints as well as subtle signals either of accommodation or willingness to risk war, a capable diplomat can discern and characterize the meaning of a given action. Misinterpretation, ignorance, lack of knowledge, or arrogance can lead to unforeseeable consequences (e.g., ignoring India's warning during the Korean War that China would intervene if U.S. forces approached the Yalu River).
Diplomatic relations among countries have long followed a common set of practices. The necessity to maintain contact as a means to facilitate dialogue between states leads to diplomatic recognition that can be of the state but not the government (e.g., North Korea by the United States) or of the government as well. Normally, such recognition is not a moral stamp of approval but a reflection that a regime controls the preponderance of national territory, and that it is in the interest of the other country to have formal channels of communication. Breaking relations can be a prelude to war; more often it is a mark of extreme disapproval. But if the regime survives, nonrecognition can be a cause of great inconvenience, since maintaining a dialogue usually involves talking either through third parties or in multilateral institutions. There are also anomalous situations, such as is currently the case with Cuba, where the United States maintains a large Interests Section under the technical protection of the Swiss embassy in order to pursue business with the Castro regime without compromising its disapproval. Sometimes a decision is made to withdraw the ambassador, temporarily or for longer periods, to deliver a significant rebuke for some policy or action of the host government. The downside to such an action is that dialogue between the states may become more rigid and is certainly conducted at a lower level of authority. In normal practice, the ambassador heads an embassy that is usually divided into numerous sections, each specializing in a particular subject area. The number of persons granted diplomatic status, which, under the Vienna Convention imparts immunity to certain host government laws, is negotiated between the two states.
An American embassy is normally organized in the following manner: at the apex is the Ambassador, appointed by the President as his personal representative and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Ambassador may be a career Foreign Service Officer from the Department of State or may be chosen form other agencies or the private sector. The Ambassador's alter ego is the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), who serves under the Ambassador to ensure the timely, efficient, and correct carrying-out of instructions and to ensure good management practices in the Embassy (i.e., avoidance of waste, fraud and mismanagement). There are usually several functional State Department Sections (i.e. Political, Economic, Consular, and Administrative) that handle the reporting, management and protection of U.S. citizens and issuance of visas to foreign nationals. Many Embassies also maintain a Defense Attaché Office with representatives from one or more of the armed services; a Defense Cooperation Office that manages foreign military sales and transfers; a Foreign Commercial Service that promotes U.S. exports; a Foreign Agricultural Service that does the same for agricultural commodities; a Legal Attaché (normally FBI) that liaises with hostcountry police authorities; Drug Enforcement Agency that does the same on narcotics issues; and a representative from Customs, possibly the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Depending on the country, many other Federal agencies may be represented. Similarly, the receiving country may have similar sections in its Embassy in Washington.
How, in the real, contemporary world, does modern American diplomacy work? With or without the publication of the National Security Strategy, which is an explicit annual overview of an Administration's top priorities often together with a general roadmap on how to achieve the objectives, the Department of State-usually in conjunction and coordination with the other foreign affairs agencies under the auspices of the National Security Council-will send telegraphic (or sometimes e-mail or telephone) instructions to an Embassy in a given country or international organization. It might be a request for information on a matter that has risen to the attention of at least the Country Director in a regional or functional bureau of the Department of State (perhaps due to media attention, pressure from a lobbyist, or a request from a member of Congress). Or the department could instruct the Ambassador to raise with the host country a matter of concern such as the arrest of an American citizen, a report of human rights abuse by a military unit, allegations of unfair commercial practices harmful to an American firm, sale of military weapons, a request for port visit of a U.S. warship, surveillance of a suspected terrorist, or many other possible items. In what becomes a continuous conversation, the appropriate section in the embassy (Political, Economic, Consular, Defense Attaché, Commercial Service, or others) would be tasked to take the necessary action. Sometimes the Embassy itself reports on a matter and offers a recommendation. In rare cases where immediate action is vital, the Embassy might report what it did and implicitly request endorsement of the action. Often, in parallel fashion, especially on important issues, the Department would convoke the Ambassador or an appropriate official from the relevant Embassy in Washington or its Mission to the United Nations to make similar points. Because embassies and foreign ministries are organized on highly hierarchical principles, it is often possible to adjust the tone and content of the message to a particular rank, thus making clear the relative importance of the message. Depending on response, the message's content, deliverer and recipient can be ratcheted up or down accordingly.
What are the principal roles of a diplomat? First, he is an agent of his government ordered to carry out instructions from authorized superiors. In the American case, there is often a vigorous internal debate throughout the foreign affairs agencies of the government on a given policy, as well as on the tactics of its proposed execution, a dialogue in which both Department of State and embassies continuously engage. However, once a decision is made, the action is carried out.
Whatever an individual diplomat's private feelings on a given issue may be, he is duty-bound to carry out the instructions. If the diplomat's conscience does not so allow, he may request a transfer to another assignment or region or offer to resign. In effect, the diplomat in this role functions as a lawyer, with the U.S. Government as his client. Just as a lawyer's ethical responsibility is to make the most vigorous possible advocacy for the client regardless of the lawyer's personal opinions of the client's innocence, so is a diplomat in public or in conversation with foreign interlocutors expected to make the best possible presentation on behalf of his government.
The diplomat is also an information-gatherer and analyst. Although not expected to compete in real-time with the media organizations such as CNN or The New York Times on basic facts, due to his presumed experience and familiarity with a country, its culture, institutions, and key personalities, the diplomat should be able to bring added value by analyzing and putting in context what to harried Washington senior leaders can seem like isolated, meaningless events. So, for the diplomat to be well-informed, he ideally should speak, read and understand the local language, extract from the mass media key nuggets of important information, develop a string of well-informed contacts covering a wide spectrum, and attend major events such as political party congresses. As a message-drafter, the diplomatic drafter needs to be succinct, clear, and pungent enough to both hold busy readers' attention and to answer the "so-what" question. The analysis needs to be substantiated by fact and interpretation, each clearly labeled as such. While never writing with the intent to provoke, when necessary, the drafter may have to call attention respectfully but clearly to actual or potential situations that may be unpleasant or resented by policymakers. At the same time, national leaders must be careful not to shoot the messenger even if they disagree with the analysis or recommendations. Sometimes, this requires courage from the drafter and restraint from the recipient. It is always the policymakers' prerogative to choose other courses. But retaliation against unwanted advice or analysis can lead to self-censorship and ultimate harm to the national interest through failure to assess events realistically.
In Washington, the middle-level diplomat is not as concerned with interpreting events in a foreign country as with assisting in defining his agency's position on a given issue (usually a whole host of them), while interacting with other elements of the foreign affairs agencies in order to glean their positions to support their own agency's position better.
A diplomat is also a negotiator. Depending on the issue, a diplomat may have more or less freedom to adjust from basic instructions, tactics and goals. In order for a negotiation to succeed, which may not always be desirable or the preferred outcome, the astute diplomat will have a good general understanding of his counterpart's baseline requirement, some sense of the national cultural manner of negotiating, and a willingness to bargain-but not to bargain away essential or vital objectives. This propensity for negotiation, also an inherent part of a lawyer's toolkit, is what sometimes infuriates ideological or idealistic individuals, since they believe it immoral to negotiate with either blatantly evil states or leaders or they believe it puts the U.S. in a position of appearing to make compromises on what can be construed as vital interests. Unless there is no longer a need to negotiate at all because of acknowledged overwhelming power of one country, or because diplomacy has yielded to open war, such compromises are an inherent property of having to deal with a Hobbesian world of sovereign states. Even criminal prosecutors make plea-bargains with criminals to achieve a balance of justice, resource use, and the likelihood of conviction on the most serious charges.
In a slightly different key, a diplomat facilitates and maintains dialogue with his counterparts, hopefully with a view to arriving at complementary assessments of threats, benefits, and actions to take to maximize their respective national interests. If the dialogue goes far enough, it can lead to commitments usually expressed in the form of treaties or agreements. They can range from reciprocal reduction of tariffs to willingness to go to war on behalf of another country.
Diplomats also act as spokespersons and sounding boards for the country. A good diplomat will be effective in public and private gatherings at furthering his country's interests and refuting criticism of it by couching his advocacy in a manner best suited to the culture where he is stationed. Because of the ubiquity of media outlets, a good diplomat learns how to access the host country media, key decisionmakers, and most relevant institutions (parliament, military, chambers of commerce, labor union federations etc.), and gets his point across over the blare of "white noise" emanating in the modern media.
At the more senior level, diplomats serve as counselors to national leaders, few of whom are regional or global experts. While diplomats rarely have the final say in the most solemn decision a nation can make-the decision to go to war-they can serve to make clear the potential costs as well as benefits of such acts and the likely prospects of coalitions in favor of (or opposed to) their country. While certainly not pacifists, diplomats are temperamentally and professionally inclined to seek non-violent solutions partly because that is what they do, and partly because they frequently can foresee second-and third-order consequences that can lead to a worse situation than the status quo ante bellum. It is at this juncture that politicians and the media sometimes confuse reporting and analysis that may be at odds with national leadership goals with disloyalty. It is not a desire for the status quo, let alone a preference for dealing with dictators, that may drive diplomats as some have charged. Rather it is a realization that in the absence of comprehensive universally acknowledged supremacy, negotiation with other regimes, no matter how unpalatable, may be necessary. The obvious classic quote is that of Winston Churchill, who, despite being before and after World War II an adamant anti-Communist, said upon Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, "If Hitler invaded hell, I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons." 3
To sum up, diplomacy is a mechanism-one among many-used in furtherance of the national interest and in protection of the national security. While styles of diplomacy may differ by national cultures, personal idiosyncrasies, and historical memories, they all have a common purpose. As long as there are states, and they hold differing assessments of their national interests, there will be diplomacy. While technology is making certain traditional means of conducting diplomacy obsolete, the core functions of diplomacy will remain. In the past, airplanes and telegraphs made clipper ships and quill pen instructions obsolete. New information technology is already making reporting far more focused on analysis than on simple news-gathering, which is done better by CNN, and e-mail and cell phones are replacing cabled instructions. Such advances occasionally produce serious suggestions to eliminate some or many embassies, but only because of a perceived more efficient manner of performing their functions. Diplomacy is still a vital element of national power.  Diplomacy, broadly defined as the peaceful dialogue and interaction between political units, is as old as civilization itself. The first known peace treaty was signed about 2300 BC between a king of Ebla, in what is today Syria, and the king of Assyria. The Amarna tablets record the diplomatic correspondence between Egypt and Syrian rulers more than 1,400 years ago, while Genesis 14 talks of Abram's "treaty of alliance" with Amorite kings. From the 8th to the 3rd century BC, China was divided among several "warring states" that conducted diplomacy as well as made war on each other in order to survive and succeed, as Sun Tzu's writings indicate. Other early civilizations offer similar examples of diplomatic activity.
This chapter, concerning the development of modern diplomacy from its origins in 15th-century Europe until the 20th century, seeks to accomplish five things. First, the chapter describes the origins of the modern state in Renaissance Italy and shows how that new type of political organization developed a new kind of diplomacy that met its needs. Second, it examines the role of Florentine political thinker Niccolò Machiavelli in providing a theoretical basis for the new state and for the new diplomacy used to accomplish its goals. The chapter stresses that Machiavelli gave directions to rulers of the new states-whether monarchies, principalities, or republics-on how to be successful in an international system characterized by constant interaction among geographically sovereign units for power, influence, and security. Third, the chapter describes the parallel development of the modern sovereign, or Westphalian, state and the modern diplomacy that serves it. Fourth, it looks at the application of modern diplomacy to the classic European age of grand strategy and the balance of power from 1648 to the First World War. Finally, the chapter provides additional background and supporting information for the other essays in this volume that deal with the characteristics of the state, the nature of the international system, and the role of diplomacy as an element of national power in the contemporary world.
Europe created modern diplomacy because Europe created the modern, geographically sovereign state-the so-called Westphalian state-after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The new form of international actor that has characterized the modern international system required a new kind of diplomacy, matched to its needs and consonant with its nature.
The modern, geographically sovereign state (or, nation-state) began to emerge in Europe during the 16th century as the old structures of European international order began to break down. The international order that Europe had inherited from the Middle Ages was composed of structures of power that were different from the nation-states that compose our contemporary international system. There were structures that existed above and beyond today's nation-state, structures that we can call supra-statal and structures existing below and within today's nation-state that we can call infra-statal.
The chief supra-statal institutions were the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, both rooted in the spiritual domain and both reflecting the glory of the ancient Roman Empire. Both Popes and Emperors claimed to be the heirs of Rome. Popes and Emperors claimed wide and broad powers over other rulers and over the subjects of other rulers, which gave them legal, religious, financial, and other authorities. The primary infra-statal institutions were a bewildering (to us, not to contemporaries) assortment of thousands of autonomous jurisdictions, starting from "national" kingdoms like England, France, and Aragon, and continuing down a long hierarchical chain of political organizations through principalities, duchies, free counties, bishoprics, free cities, commercial alliances (like the Hanseatic League), baronies, petty lordships of all types and sizes, to corporate bodies like guilds, military orders, and religious orders. All of them exercised what we would call political power in various ways. The jurisdictions, rights, powers, and responsibilities of both the supra-statal and the infra-statal institutions often conflicted and overlapped.
Together these supra-national and infra-national institutions made up what contemporaries called Christendom. Christendom's institutions drew their strength and legitimacy from feudal traditional practices that mixed public office and public functions with private property and hereditary rights; from religious and spiritual sanctions; and from social and cultural habits a thousand years in the making. Political order in Christendom was characterized by interlocking networks of rights and responsibilities fragmented into many small, autonomous parts. The focus of political authority was personal, feudal, and local. The idea that political rule was strictly linked to control of territory rather than to other sources of authority was largely absent, so that rulers were not geographically sovereign in the sense of exerting supreme and monopolistic authority over and within a given territory and population. Christendom as a political system appears to us to have been ambiguous, complicated, messy, and illogical, but it worked as long as people believed in it.
The medieval order of Christendom started to break down under pressure from rising political units that drew their strength and legitimacy from new territorial and demographic realities; that were sanctioned more by the possession and use of practical power than by religion and tradition; and that were evolving behind borders that were more definite and more restrictive than the old porous, overlapping medieval political units. The growth of vernacular languages and the concomitant beginnings of national consciousness aided the process of the development of the new political units, which would eventually become the legally equal, sovereign states. This would intensify into the process of state formation at the expense of both the old supra-national institutions and the old infra-national institutions.
Italy was the birthplace of the Renaissance and also of the first prototypes of the modern, geographically sovereign state. The reason for this was Renaissance Italy's vanguard status in most areas of European endeavor-art, literature, science, jurisprudence, philosophy, economics, and finance-but also in political development. Jacob Burckhardt's classic 1860 interpretive essay, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, had as its central theme the problem of politics and of political anthropology. Burckhardt believed that it was the unique political environment of Renaissance Italy that led to the development of the Renaissance mind with its more liberated ideas, ideals, morals and attitudes. The two overarching organizing institutions of the pre-Renaissance West, of what people thought of, not as Europe, but as Christendom-the universal Papacy and the universalistic Holy Roman Empire-had been effectively absent from Italy and had therefore exerted little or no influence in Italian political life for over a century and a half. That absence, Burckhardt wrote, "left Italy in a political condition which differed essentially from that of other countries of the West" and explained why "in them we detect for the first time the modern political spirit of Europe."

Because the foundations of the medieval international order crumbled in Italy around 1300, the Italians began to create a new political institution to fill the void left by that collapse. This new institution was called in Italian the stato, transforming a word that until then had been used to describe the legal classes into which people fell within a political unit. Now stato-and all its cognates, such as state in English, état in French, estado in Spanish, Staat in German, and so on-would become the term used to describe the basic political unit of the new international order. The Italian microcosm was an anarchic political space. The new states that the Italians evolved to fill that space were the prototypes of the future Westphalian state. They were, in contemporary eyes, illegitimate, existing outside the medieval and feudal hierarchies of political authority. They had to create their own legitimacy by defending their existence. They were, therefore, warlike and aggressive. They were geographically discrete-separate and distinct from other states or any other authorities and were nearly "sovereign" in the modern sense of the term, jealously guarding a monopoly of political authority within their borders and recognizing no other authority higher than themselves.
The power vacuum created by the absence of higher authority in Renaissance Italy resulted in the growth of several Italian city-states into territorial states that absorbed smaller and weaker neighbors. This Darwinian process of political consolidation by conquest resulted eventually in the creation of a miniature state system in Italy, an enclosed political space with five "great" powers contending among themselves for hegemony and influence over smaller, weaker city-states. By 1450, the five principal territorial states of Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples, and the Papal State (based on Rome) dominated the Italian peninsula. As they maneuvered against one another for power and advantage, making and breaking alliances among themselves, the Italian peninsula came to constitute an enclosed system of interacting states-a state system-that was a microcosm of the European state system to follow. In 1454, a series of wars to resist Milanese hegemonic aggression resulted in the general Peace of Lodi. In 1455, most of the five powers and other smaller ones signed a mutual security agreement, the Italic League, which guaranteed the existence of signatory states and called for common action against outsiders. These arrangements led to nearly fifty years of peace on the peninsula. Managing the peace was largely the work of Lorenzo "the Magnificent," the Medici ruler of Florence who believed that maintaining a balance among the five powers was better policy than trying to eliminate enemies. This was the first conscious balance of power policy in a post-medieval state system.
The 15th-century Italian states were prototypes of the modern state in the sense that they interacted as equals with the other states of their microcosmic systems and in the way they interacted with the other powers and lesser political units of Italy. The new territorial states existed because of the absence in Italy of the great, overarching, hierarchy-anchoring, legitimacy-conferring institutions of Papacy and Empire. As such, the new, legitimacy-challenged Italian states had to struggle to survive, and they knew it. The Italian state was "a new fact appearing in history-the state as the outcome of reflection and calculation, the state as a work of art," according to Burckardt.

As the Italian states became more self-conscious of their circumstances, they began to recognize that the medieval way of diplomacy was no longer adequate to their needs. Medieval diplomacy was based on the occasional dispatch and receipt of very prestigious but often untrained individuals as envoys on specific, short-term missions. Occasionally, diplomats were as much hostages as negotiators. The diplomat usually viewed himself as serving as an emissary for the higher needs of Christendom, not the political ruler who sent or received him. But the new Italian territorial states needed diplomatic institutions and mechanisms more effective, more durable, and more permanent than the old medieval ones. They needed both continuous dialogue with their neighbors and continuous intelligence regarding their neighbors' designs. The Renaissance ruler needed a mechanism to gather and report intelligence and to sustain diplomatic dialogue. They invented therefore the key institution of modern diplomacy-the resident ambassador endowed with diplomatic immunity-to conduct the relations between the five states of the system continuously and seamlessly. During the second half of the 15th century, all five of the major Italian states and many smaller ones established permanent accredited diplomatic missions headed by ambassadors in each of the five major capitals. 
3
At the end of the 15th century, the days of the Italian microcosm of an enclosed and protected peninsular state system were numbered. The world beyond the Alps, with political units much more militarily powerful than the Italian states, began to influence Italian affairs. In 1494, the French invaded successfully, drawing other non-Italian powers, especially Spain and the revived Holy Roman Empire, into a struggle for control of the peninsula that made Italy a battle field for sixty years. The Italian microcosm was destroyed, but not before its transalpine destroyers adopted the diplomatic methods and diplomatic institutions that the Italian states had developed and deployed to meet the needs of their prototypical modern state system. The Italian Renaissance way of diplomacy became the basis of the European way of diplomacy for the future.

Concepts like the amorality of politics, the ends justify the means, and raison d'état are usually labeled "Machiavellian," referring to the ideas of the Florentine statesman, diplomat, and political thinker Niccolò Machiavelli (1465-1527). His works have come to epitomize the difference between the pre-modern, medieval international system, and the modern, geographically sovereign one that first appeared in the Italian state system of the 15th century.
Machiavelli received a typical Italian Renaissance education based on the ancient Greek and Roman classics. That was the essence of the Renaissance, which means rebirth-the Italians and others believed that they were presiding over a rebirth of learning, art, and philosophy based on the recovery of ancient examples of those pursuits. The Renaissance was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman culture, as the Reformation would latter be obsessed with ancient Jewish and Christian culture. Renaissance humanism was a preference for those areas of ancient Greek and Roman culture that were oriented toward empowering human beings in this world rather than preparing them for another, better world. The Renaissance humanist curriculum stressed rhetoric, history, and ethics, because these were tools men could use to pursue secular, and especially political, economic, and social objectives.
Machiavelli put those tools to work as a bureaucrat in the government of the Florentine Republic. From 1498 to 1512, he worked in the equivalents of its war and foreign ministries and went on many diplomatic missions to the other courts of Italy and those of France and the Empire. He was a participant in the political and diplomatic life of Italy in the last years of the existence of the Italian microcosm as well as the first years of the spread of the new state structure and the new diplomacy to the rest of Europe. In 1512, the republic he served underwent a revolution and the autocratic Medici family returned to power. Machiavelli was forced into exile in a hamlet near Florence. There he wrote his principal works, especially The Prince, The Discourses, and The Art of War, all classics of political realism. The Prince gives advice to monarchical regimes, especially to princes newly raised to power, on how to retain and extend their power and influence. The Discourses does much the same thing for republican regimes. The Art of War analyzes the military element of national power in terms of its relationship to the political and social bases of the state.
Machiavelli's contribution to political thought was instantly, inevitably, and lastingly controversial. Most of his readership was confined to The Prince, a short, enigmatic, epigrammatic, and elusive work that lent itself to misinterpretation. (Machiavelli's other more straightforward works, including The Art of War and The Discourses, were less often read.) In The Prince, Machiavelli gave practical advice to an Italian prince trying to create a new state. His advice was blunt: In order to be successful the new prince had to use every tool available to him, including violence, deceit, treachery, and dissimulation. The desired end was to increase his own and his state's power. The means were politically expedient actions, without reference to justice or traditional morality. The standard of a ruler's conduct was raison d'état, not Christian ethics.
Contemporaries and later writers interpreted The Prince as the bible of the doctrine of political expediency that justified immoral conduct if it produced the desired result; elevated power over principle; and that denied that Christian morality applied to politics. He was accused of justifying any means to accomplish political goals, especially the retention of and extension of state power. He was denounced for advising rulers to use cunning, duplicity, and bad faith to enhance their own power and undermine their enemies. Criticism of Machiavelli's ideas developed into a genre of writing on political theory, as thinker after thinker wrote an "anti-Machiavelli" attack on his doctrines. Shakespeare called him "the murderous Machiavel." The Catholic Church condemned all Machiavelli's writings and placed them on its Index of Prohibited Books. Later, Machiavelli was praised for the very same doctrines, now seen as Realpolitik-the "politics of reality" or "power politics"-based on practical and material factors rather than theoretical or ethical objectives. Proponents hailed The Prince as an attempt to "liberate" politics from morality and ethical concerns and to see politics "as it really is." Louis XIV called The Prince his "favorite nightcap;" Napoleon annotated his copy of the book heavily; Benito Mussolini extolled it as a "handbook for statesmen;" and Adolf Hitler said he kept a copy of it by his bedside.

Machiavelli's ideas went much further and deeper than such readers of The Prince realized. In fact, when one takes into account his ideas as expressed in his more substantial political works, Machiavelli emerges as the first and still the preeminent theorist of the new geographically sovereign state. He was also the first theorist of the new diplomacy that the new states required in order to survive and prosper. Machiavelli's political theory is a reflection of the rise of the state system in Italy and the new diplomacy that kept them running. As such, his ideas both descriptive and prescriptive. Machiavelli's political theory constitutes the "user's manual" for rulers and servants of the new state-statesmen, diplomats, and military leaders alike-in the new international environment. Machiavelli's political theories instruct those who ruled the new state and directed its engagement with the world how to succeed at statecraft under the new conditions.
Machiavelli's world view is a primer for the realist theory of international affairs. In all his major works, Machiavelli assumed a Westphalian international order long before the Peace of Westphalia gave its name to such an order-one composed of geographically sovereign states with durable boundaries, equal in legal standing and legitimacy, in which the ruler monopolized the lawful use of force. Machiavelli assumed an anarchic international order, with no higher court of justice or authority than the state itself in defending and advancing its interests. He assumed that recourse to war will be frequent and that the new state must be organized for war to be successful. And he assumed that the state's engagement with the world would be constant; the state must also be organized for continuous, professional diplomacy, in order to be successful. If we read Machiavelli broadly-not just The Prince, but The Discourses and The Art of War as well-with these assumptions in mind, we take away a coherent theoretical structure that reflects the Italian microcosm's political realities that were already on their way to becoming the future international political realities of Europe as a whole.
Machiavelli's lessons for statecraft, war, and diplomacy were generally valid for monarchies and republics. Rulers were responsible for the good of their state, for its survival and stability-in a word, for its security. Rulers were judged by their success in defending and advancing the interests of the state, not by any other standards, moral or political. The more legitimate the government, that is, the more recognized its use of state power by constitutions, laws, tradition, custom, and religious sanction, the stronger it would be, and the less the ruler would need recourse to extreme measures. The less legitimate the government, the more likely its ruler would need to use extreme measures to enforce the government's rule. Republics and monarchies could possess strong legitimacy. But republics were by virtue of their representative nature stronger and more stable than monarchies. Republics owed their strength and stability to their ability to mobilize the loyalty and power of the people better than monarchies, because the will of the people lent powerful reinforcement and legitimacy to any state that represented their interests rather than those of the monarch. Well-constituted republics were internally stable and externally strong because they were better able to promote and exploit the economic prosperity, military potential, and patriotism of their people. But the rulers of a republic had the same responsibility for the security of the state as monarchs, and they were judged by the same standard-reason of state. Machiavelli advocated a return to ancient Roman republican values, especially the replacement of decadent Christian religious values with a Roman-style "civic religion" that worshiped service to the state as the highest value, in order to reform the Italian states of his day and prepare them for success in the anarchic international order in which he lived.
One of Machiavelli's key legacies was the concept that the state's primary role was external, to deal with other states through diplomacy and war-the primacy of external policy. Another was that all states, including republics, needed a strong executive power in their constitutions to facilitate action against external threats. The state that Machiavelli designed in his major works would be able to fulfill its mission of active and successful participation in an anarchic international system. That state could contend with other sovereign states for power, influence, and security and would justify its actions by their success according to the measure of reason of state. 6
The French King Louis XI led his army into Italy, took and occupied cities from the border to Naples, and then successfully retreated despite suffering tactical defeat by Italian forces. This revealed the stark power differential between the small Italian states and their European counterparts, especially the strong monarchies of France and Spain. Italy became a battleground for foreign powers for the next sixty years. The invasions of Italy helped spread the Renaissance to all of Europe, including the new Italian political institutions. The idea of the new state with its exclusive territorial basis and its concentration of power in the ruler's hands was attractive to Western European rulers. And the European rulers had one thing that the Italian Renaissance new states lacked-legitimacy. Their rule, whether over kingdoms, principalities, duchies or other jurisdictions, was sanctioned and supported by the soft power of legitimacy based on religion, tradition, or custom. When these rulers adopted the ways of the Italians in concentrating power within defined territorial limits, they became more and more powerful at the expense of the old medieval system. Diffused authority and fragmented rights and responsibilities among nobility and church, cities and social orders, and all the other atomized institutions that claimed a share of political power on traditional and feudal grounds could not withstand the new state system.
The northern rulers also adopted the diplomacy that the Italians had developed to serve their new states. More and more, diplomacy was restricted to political units that had pretensions to sovereignty-a monopoly of legitimate force within the borders of the territory they controlled. The Italian system of permanent, resident ambassadors, duly accredited and endowed with diplomatic immunity, rapidly became the standard for Europe. The resident ambassadorial system gave rulers ways to influence other states by representing policies and views to other rulers, by providing timely and accurate political intelligence back to the capital, and by concerting actions with allied and friendly governments; the system soon became the norm throughout Europe.
The invasions of Italy and the spread of the Renaissance Italian state system to the rest of Europe in the early-16th century coincided with the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation had great influence on the development of the modern state system and modern diplomacy because it discredited the two great supra-statal political institutions of Christendom, the Papacy and the Empire. The Reformation radically reduced those institutions' ability to influence the international system, and at the same time greatly strengthened the power of the rulers of the new states. The Reformation strengthened the hand of Protestant rulers by transferring to them the effective leadership of the reformed churches. The Reformation therefore intersected with the rise of territorial states in ways that powerfully accelerated the process of state formation that the Renaissance had begun. The Reformation harnessed the immense power of religion to the raison d'être of the state and added religious differences to the already long menu of reasons for states to conflict with other states. In the short run, the expansion and development of diplomacy suffered as states of different religions downgraded or interrupted normal diplomatic relations for a time. In the long run, however, the development of diplomacy resumed its previous trajectory, keeping pace with the development of state power and self-awareness, as well as with the extension of a state system that required continuous and consequential diplomatic activity in order to function effectively.
The Reformation led to a long series of religious struggles, first in Germany and Central Europe, and later in France, the Low Countries, and elsewhere. It led, too, to the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which reorganized the Church in Catholic lands as the Reformation reorganized the churches in Protestant lands. In both Catholic and Protestant Europe, however, the religious breakdown of the unity of Christendom resulted in a tremendous source of political influence for the new states-religious uniformity under the control of the state and its ruler became the norm. Everywhere, the sanction of guardian of the faith was added to the secular ruler's author-ity, vastly increasing the concentration of his power. This fact was recognized in international law and practice by the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 between the Catholic Emperor Charles V and the rebellious Protestant states of his Empire. The question of which religion people would be allowed to practice-in this case, either Catholicism or Lutheranism-was to be decided by the local ruler. This arrangement was expressed as the principle of cujus regio, ejus religio-the ruler's religion is the religion of the ruler's people. At the state level, no toleration of religious minorities was foreseen. At the macro level, the result was greater toleration for religious diversity in the international system of sovereign states.
As the modern state system developed, its characteristic dynamics developed as well. In an anarchic system, hegemonic threats appeared as one state grew stronger than others. The system began to respond to hegemonic threats through the mechanism of the balance of power, in which coalitions developed to resist, restrain, and reduce the would-be hegemon's power and influence to manageable proportions. This happened even during the wars of religion. The attempts of Habsburg Emperor (and King of Spain) Charles V to restore and extend the power of the Holy Roman Empire from the 1530s until his abdication in 1556 led to the formation of coalitions against him on both religious and purely political grounds (although the distinction was losing its edge). This was the last serious attempt by a Holy Roman Emperor to achieve European hegemony and Christian unity, another indication that the modern state was succeeding in crowding out premodern political forms. The development of the major European states into absolute monarchies was another. The balance of power mechanism was extended beyond Europe, when France signed a treaty with the Turkish Sultan in 1536 to bring the Ottoman Empire into play diplomatically in its resistance to Charles's hegemonic effort.
Habsburg dynasts made two more attempts to assert hegemony over Europe using religion as a justification. Charles V's son, King Philip II (1556-1598) of Spain, tried to leverage the power of his realm and its wealthy overseas empire to achieve European hegemony, but met the opposition of coalitions that linked his Dutch and Belgian Protestant subjects with England and France. Between 1618 and 1648, the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Empire again grasped for hegemony, trying to exploit the Counter-Reformation's partial successes to impose a Habsburg-controlled order on Europe once again. The Thirty Years War that prevented that from happening was the result of the resistance of a wide coalition of German Protestant states backed by Catholic France and Lutheran Sweden. The leading anti-hegemonic statesman of the first half of the 17th century was France's Cardinal Richelieu, who knitted together the anti-Habsburg coalition that won the Thirty Years War by blocking the Spanish and Austrian branches of that family's bid for mastery of the continent.
The Westphalia settlement of 1648 ended the period of religious wars and ushered in one in which the Great Powers engaged in episodic struggles to extend their power and influence in order to achieve hegemony for themselves, or to prevent the achievement of hegemony by others. The settlement itself is generally considered to have established definitively the sovereign state as the basic international actor and to have christened the European state system as one composed of distinct and juridically equal, sovereign states. These Westphalian sovereign states monopolized the legitimate use of force within well-defined borders and struggled for power in an anarchical international environment. The reality was not quite so advanced, but the idea of the modern Westphalian state would gradually become accepted as the norm. A constant search for equilibrium governed the system through diplomacy that sought to restore the balance of power among competing states. The universalist idea was no longer seriously considered outside the Papal Apartments in the Vatican.
Adam Watson describes how the period from Westphalia to Vienna contributed to the development of modern diplomacy. First, there was the propagation of the concept of the professional career diplomat, who cultivated specific skills that ensured effective performance of his duties. Second, there arose the idea that these professional diplomats belonged to informal but useful groups of accredited diplomats at various courts of Europe who shared a common outlook and common goals. These groups included a common need to protect their status and privileges; mutual advantage in exchanging information and evaluations, especially among representatives of allied and friendly states; and reciprocal advantage in maintaining good working relations, even as their governments quarreled. The diplomatic corps had taken shape and would become permanent, although its members came and went. Third, diplomatic congresses began to play an increasingly important role in ending and regulating conflict, and began to be seen not as isolated events, but as "climaxes in dialogue."

Through the rest of the 18th century, French attempts to reassert itself and English efforts to prevent France from dominating Europe while extending its own colonial and commercial empire were played out in a series of wars based on shifting alliances-the War of the Polish Succession (1733-1738); the War of the Austrian Succession, or King George's War in America (1740-1748); the Seven Years War (1756-1763), called the French and Indian War in America (1754-1763); and the War of the American Revolution (1775-1783). The war in America became a Great Power struggle, as skillful diplomacy and astute use of intelligence by the colonists intersected with the French desire for revenge on Britain. That produced an American-Franco-Spanish alliance that fought the British militarily, and a pro-American, Russian-led League of Armed Neutrality served to isolate Britain diplomatically and economically.
The French Revolution and the Napoleonic period brought a renewed French drive for continental hegemony as well as British resolve to prevent it, involving coalitions on both sides. Napoleon, in fact, realized albeit briefly (1807-1811) the general European hegemony about which Charles V and Louis XIV had dreamed. In Europe in 1811, only Britain was outside the French orbit. The French Empire was surrounded by satellite states and allies of dubious loyalty but unwilling to oppose Napoleon's dictates openly. Napoleon's political overreach in Spain and military defeat in Russia in 1812 revived British efforts to create an anti-French coalition. British diplomacy was ultimately successful in exploiting the state system's inherent unwillingness to tolerate an aggressive hegemon by constructing and maintaining a Grand Coalition of all the other Great Powers to defeat Napoleon and finally to impose regime change on the French.
The post-Napoleonic settlement began an unprecedented period of comity in the European state system. After the Congress of Vienna that codified the post-Napoleonic settlement, no general wars lasting more than a few months or involving all of the Great Powers were fought for nearly a century. The statesmen and diplomats gathered at Vienna were intent on restoring the 18th-century balance of power in the European state system as the best way of ensuring peace. The territorial changes they made and the institutional initiatives they took were successful in providing the basis for a durable peace among the Great Powers for nearly a hundred years. No shock to the international system as great as that produced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Hegemony has yet been followed by such a sustained period of peace.
Sir Harold Nicolson described the chief characteristics of the diplomacy of the period from Vienna to the First World War, when grand strategy was implemented on the basis of the balance of power, first in Europe and then in the rest of the world, as the European powers spread their influence internationally. First, diplomacy was Eurocentric. Europe was regarded as the most important area of the world and the other continents of secondary importance. Second, diplomacy was Great-Power-centric. The smaller and weaker powers were drawn into the orbits of one of the Great Powers in order to play their supporting roles in the unending maneuver to maintain, restore, or overthrow the existing balance of power. Third, the Great Powers possessed a "common responsibility for the conduct of the Small Powers and the preservation of peace between them." This implied a right of intervention by the Great Powers in crises and conflicts involving the smaller and weaker powers. Fourth, there was the establishment in every European country of a "professional diplomatic service on a more or less identical model." These professional diplomats developed a kind of corporate identity based on a common belief, notwithstanding the policies of their various governments, "that the purpose of diplomacy was the preservation of peace." Finally, diplomacy was conducted on "the rule that sound negotiation must be continuous and confidential."

During the period 1848-1871, the wave of nationalistic political and social revolutions that swept over Europe in 1848-1849 strongly challenged the system, and the gradual breakup of the Ottoman Empire in Europe, which led to the Crimean War of 1856, further taxed it. The processes of Italian and then German national unification were severe tests for the state system and deeply affected the balance of power, but even these events involved short, limited wars that were not allowed to become general European conflicts. The forces of nationalism were managed without recourse to general war. Italy was united under the Kingdom of Piedmont-Savoy through the diplomatic virtuosity of Prime Minister Camillo di Cavour, who joined the Franco-British alliance against Russia in the Crimean War (1854-56). This gained him the British diplomatic support and French military assistance he needed to defeat the Austrians (1859) who ruled northern Italy and to begin the unification process completed by his successors in 1870. Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck united Germany by isolating France diplomatically, while constructing an anti-French coalition among the smaller German states to defeat France in 1870 and proclaim the creation of the German Empire in 1871 with the Prussian king as Kaiser. Lord Palmerston put British naval and financial might to work to influence the balance of power on the continent to London's advantage. The American Civil War did not tempt the European powers, especially Britain and France, to serious intervention, either militarily or diplomatically. U.S. diplomacy, aimed at keeping the Europeans out of the issue, bested Confederate diplomacy-which sought European intervention and eventual recognition of the Confederacy as a legitimate, sovereign state. Even under the difficult conditions created by a rising tide of nationalism and political and social revolutionary sentiments, the European powers managed to regulate their state system without recourse to general war or war between certain powers for more than a few months.
During the years 1871-1914, European diplomacy was concentrated on the peaceful management of two intense contests among the European powers, the competition for the remnants of the dissolving Ottoman Empire, especially in Europe, and the competition for colonial expansion in Africa and Asia. Bismarck's political foresight and diplomatic skill were demonstrated in both spheres; the first was when he assembled the Powers in Berlin in 1878 to craft a general settlement to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 that involved multiple changes of boundaries and prevented war from spreading. Bismarck called them together again in 1885 to submit a number of African colonial disputes to general arbitration and international decision. The United States under Theodore Roosevelt played a leading diplomatic role in ending the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 through mediation at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
The 19th century produced advances in diplomatic institutions in response to developments in military affairs, economic expansion, nationalist ambitions, and the rise of public opinion. From the 1830s, military attachés were added to embassy staffs, reflecting the growing complexity of the military element of national power. Soon after, commercial attachés made a similar appearance in the diplomatic world, reflecting the growing importance of the economic element of national power. Governments also began to engage in cultural diplomacy by supporting missionaries they saw as spreading their languages and cultures as well as faith, and by promoting cultural associations like the French Alliance Française and the Italian Società Dante Alighieri to encourage familiarity with and respect for their respective languages and cultures. Finally, Governments started to exploit the possibilities of influencing foreign public opinion, usually by trying to influence the popular press to report and comment favorably on their policies and actions.

1. Jacob Burckhardt, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, Oxford: Paaidon, 1944, p. 2. A long struggle for preeminence between the Popes of Rome and the Holy Roman Emperors resulted in the defeat of the German emperors and their expulsion from the Italian peninsula from 1250-1275. The Popes had called on French arms to do so and soon thereafter fell under French influence. From 1307-1378, most Popes were French and resided in Avignon in Southern France rather than Rome. That period of "Babylonian Captivity" in France was followed by nearly 50 years of deep division in the Church government, the Great Schism, when two or three different popes, each one of them considering the others "antipopes," were elected by different factions and residing in different places inside and outside Italy, contended for the papal authority. The schism was only fully healed when Pope Martin V won general recognition as the only legitimate Pope and returned to reside regularly in Rome in 1420.

The Papacy had clerical envoys in every Christian court, and the repository of their reports in the Cancelleria palace in Rome was the prototype for the foreign ministries of later times; some governments still refer to foreign ministers as chancellors. The Venetian Republic also had its commercial agents all over Europe and the Middle East who were tasked with providing topical information to the city's rulers. In the 15th century, the Medici family that ruled Florence started to require the managers of the foreign branches of the family banking house to submit similar reports.  6. Machiavelli was a major influence on Clausewitz, who read the Italian's main works and admired his approach to war and politics: "No book on earth is more necessary to the statesman than Machiavelli's; those who affect disgust at his principles are idealistic dilettantes . . . The twenty-first chapter of Machiavelli's Prince is the basic code for all diplomacy -and woe to those that fail to heed it!" Carl von Clausewitz, Historical and Political Writings, Peter Paret and Daniel Moran, eds./trans., Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992, pp. 268-269. 
The urgency prevailing in Europe as the common currency comes under threat of collapse makes brutally clear the linkage between economics and national security. Polish Foreign Minister Radislaw Sikorski could not have been more direct when he stated to an audience of the German intellectual elite that the Eurozone crisis poses a greater threat to Poland than terrorism or the Taliban.

The British economist and diplomat, Nicholas Bayne, one of the leading writers on the subject, defines economic diplomacy as the "method by which states conduct their external economic relations. It embraces how they make decisions domestically, how they negotiate internationally, and how the two processes interact."

What does a country try to achieve by engaging in economic diplomacy? Clearly, for a country as large and well endowed as the United States, enhancing economic prosperity is a task first directed to the home front. Sound monetary and fiscal policies are essential for a strong, growing economy for which no clever foreign policy can substitute. That said, trade and financial integration makes even the U.S. economy depend highly on developments outside its borders. However, that raises a second question: Why does commercial activity between mostly private companies require the intervention of diplomats? International trade and financial flows, like their domestic equivalents, require a host of regulations, rules, and agreements to proceed smoothly. Domestically, negotiation of the rules among different industries, states, and other government entities can be complicated. Played across national borders, the complexity increases logarithmically. Enter the pinstripers to get everyone to agree. The stakes are high. Whereas domestically, the ultimate compromise among economic actors will be in accord with federal law, internationally the most adept or powerful nation will win. And who makes the rules, rules.
Shaping the rules and institutions is the most effective, albeit difficult, means to advance a nation's economic goals. In the aftermath of World War II, the United States was able to control the design of the economic and financial institutions governing trade and financial flows so that they served U.S. interests by institutionalizing free market principles. As the only large economy left standing after the devastation of the world war, the ability of the United States to control and shape developments was unparalleled and unlikely to be achieved again by the U.S. or any other power. Though our relative weight in the global economy has diminished, we still play a significant role in developing international regulations to stop practices we consider unfair for U.S. business, e.g., anti-bribery conventions and efforts to untie assistance from commercial interests.
Simply put, the objective of economic policy is to define the playing field so that we can pursue our economic interests as easily as possible. Broadly defined, those interests are:
1. Access to markets for our exports and for raw materials. As intellectual property is one of our most valuable exports, pursuing this interest includes promoting measures to protect intellectual property rights (IPR); 2. Maintenance of orderly international financial systems that are not vulnerable to use by criminal and terrorist elements; and, 3. Promotion of market economics worldwide.
The cast of players in economic diplomacy comprises an interagency process that is every bit as competitive and contentious as that of the national security strategy, but is not limited to governmental entities. The lead government agency for developing and coordinating U.S. trade policy and conducting international trade and trade-related investment negotiations is the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). A Cabinet-level position, reporting directly to the President, the USTR was established in 1963 as the Office of the Special Trade Representative with limited powers. 
3
Encompassed in USTR's trade responsibilities is trade in services, including financial, investment issues, and intellectual property rights. The latter is one of the agency's top priorities. Legislation in the 1974 Trade Act, referred to as Special 301, requires the administration to assess annually each country's record on protecting intellectual property rights. The U.S. Department of State (DoS) does much of the gathering and compiling of relevant information, with heavy input from American industry. (The pharmaceutical, motion picture, and software industries are the most actively involved.) Countries found guilty of insufficiently protecting IPR (in some cases, governments are suspected of direct involvement in piracy) are put on a priority or priority-watch list. The most egregious violators are subject to sanctions and, when relevant, suspension of assistance.
Whereas USTR as a rule eschews political considerations in trade policy decisionmaking, a key role of the DoS is to balance U.S. foreign political and economic interests. In a series of speeches on economic statecraft in the second half of 2011, Secretary Hillary Clinton highlighted the linkage between foreign and economic relations and the need for the DoS to improve its capacity to promote U.S. economic interests.

The conflict between economic and foreign policy interests often manifests itself in discussions between the EEB and the regional geographic bureaus. Traditionally, the geographic bureaus were more powerful and foreign policy trumped economics, but over time, the Department leadership has come to understand the importance of economic interests. Ambassadors are formally charged by the President with promoting U.S. businesses. The Ambassador in all but the smallest or poorest country spends a considerable portion of his/her time meeting with and advising U.S. companies and advocating for their interests at the highest levels of the host country. The usually close relationship between the U.S. Embassy and the American Chamber of Commerce or its equivalent is an example of the nexus of public and private interests that characterizes economic diplomacy. Few economic agencies other than the United States Agency for International Development (US-AID) and the Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce post employees abroad. Therefore, DoS economic officers work closely with other agencies in Washington to advance their interests in the field. The FCS has representatives at U.S. embassies and missions in 80 countries. In smaller posts, DoS personnel perform FCS functions.
The International Trade Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDoC) promotes American exports and investments and, together with USTR, monitors adherence to fair trade practices. The International Trade Commission supports the latter objective by determining whether U.S. industry has been injured by imports subsidized or sold at below market prices by exporting countries. The Department's Bureau of Industry and Security administers and enforces exports regulations, including issuance of licenses for export of controlled items (other than weapons). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) performs a similar function for agricultural producers. Through its Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the USDA posts officers overseas at selected regional missions.
A key U.S. Department of the Treasury mission is protecting the stability of the international financial system and protecting U.S. financial interests. The department is the liaison between the USG and international financial institutions, but voting decisions on loans to specific countries are made at the interagency level. Treasury also administers and enforces economic trade sanctions and is responsible for combating money laundering and criminal and terrorist financial flows.
The U.S. Department of Energy's (DoE) Office of Policy and International Affairs is staffed with regional and subject experts who advise on national and international energy policies. In Washington, the DoE can be a significant force in interagency policy discussions. Its overseas presence is limited; Moscow, Russia, is one of the few capitals where the DoE maintains an office. However, frequently through its national labs, the DoE implements energy conservation and nuclear security projects in transitioning and developing countries.
Several other smaller agencies support U.S. international economic objectives by supplying services that the private sector is unable or unwilling to provide. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) provides technical assistance, training, visits, and feasibility studies for U.S. companies seeking export-generating investment projects in developing and middle-income countries. The Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (OPIC) provides financing through loans and loan guarantees for investment projects, maintains investment funds, and insures against political risk. The Export-Import Bank (EXIM) assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and services, in cases when credit and country risks make the private sector unwilling to provide credit at market rates for U.S. exports.
Though its mission is to promote development, USAID as the principal implementer of U.S. foreign assistance is vital to pursuing the U.S. interest of expanding market economies. As part of the assistance reform of the last administration, USAID activities came more directly within the authority of the DoS; the Director of Foreign Assistance at the DoS is dual-hatted as the USAID administrator. In part, the reforms are intended to further the collaborative process among DoS, Embassy teams, and USAID Washington and field missions in developing assistance strategies for countries and regions.
Beyond these traditional players, regulatory agencies in our country and our trading partners heavily influence our export potential, attractiveness as an investment recipient, and our position in international trade negotiations. As a negotiation stance, we seek to lessen the impact of safety, labor, and environmental standards on our competitiveness. One means of doing that is persuading countries to adapt standards that we consider valid-not permitting exceptions-or persuading them to adopt common standards through bilateral or multilateral agreements. For years, the U.S. and EU governments, together with business, have been working on enhancing transparency of regulations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. One of the more well-known cases in which we have not been successful in narrowing the gap pertains to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) about which the European concerns are not (in the U.S. view) consistent with available scientific information. If a country believes regulations or standards purposely inhibit trade and therefore constitute a nontariff barrier, the complaining country can bring a case to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Business groups play bit parts in traditional diplomacy; in economic diplomacy, they have a starring role. At the end of the day, economics in a free market is about private business. Business frequently drives the agenda by providing the bulk of relevant information, as noted in the description of Special 301. Industry support or lack thereof is critical in the passage of free trade agreements. At times, business also takes an enlightened view in working with government to pursue common interests, such as providing training in developing countries on intellectual property or customs protection. Given the huge volume of mutual trade and investment, cooperation among EU and U.S. firms is critical to improving economic relationships. In recognition of the powerful force of international business, in 1995 the late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown proposed the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) to bring public and civil society together to strengthen EU-U.S. commercial relations.

Congress's role in economic diplomacy surpasses that of other players. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress primary power over trade policy. Technically, the President can negotiate and enter into trade agreements by virtue of his power to run foreign policy. However, as he cannot impose duties unless Congress delegates that authority, the agreements would not be enforceable if not approved by Congress. Between 1974-94 and 2002-07, Congress granted the President "trade promotion authority," previously referred to as "fast track authority." Under this authority, Congress agreed to consider legislation to implement nontariff trade agreements quickly with no amendments and limited debate. The latest authority expired July 1, 2007, and has not been renewed.
Congress can also pass restrictions on trade, such as the infamous Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denied the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries Most-Favored Nation (MFN) tariff treatment if they restricted Jewish emigration. (Under MFN, a country's exports receive the same tariff treatment as any other country with MFN status.) The Soviet Union is gone and emigration restrictions eliminated, but Jackson-Vanik is still on the books except for Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, and the countries of Eastern Europe that have been "graduated" from the law. Although the law is essentially a formality, as it allows for a waiver on national security grounds, grounds that are always invoked, the Russians consider it a very annoying and humiliating formality. In a different but similar case and signaling increased interest in foreign economic relations, in October 2011, Congress passed a bill on misaligned exchange rates around the world, including in China.
In our political system, Congress is also the conduit of U.S. business complaints about trade policy or the practices of individual countries. As discussed more completely below, the presence of chicken farmers in most congressional districts amplified concern over Russian poultry import bans. Similarly, large American companies are strategically dispersed across congressional districts to magnify their impact. Congress also serves as a voice for nonbusiness interests that have an impact on international trade. Labor unions are a vocal example of groups that exercise influence on the process directly. Environmental concerns also make their way into trade legislation and agreements through Congress.
Epistemic communities-virtual communities of experts across national borders-can have a powerful influence on international economic (and other) policies. In this concept, groups of experts define issues and push policies that differ from, or are ahead of, those of their national governments. Climate change is a striking example of when scientists irrespective of their nationality were able to set the agenda by virtue of their expertise rather than their power base. 8
The architecture of economic diplomacy is not unlike that of other forms of diplomacy. Bilateral and international agreements provide the struts for the institutions and arrangements. Diplomats labor in these structures, employing the tools of soft power to influence and cajole other actors into accepting their countries' views. The range of acronyms and organizations in the economic realm is bountiful and often highly technical: from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the International Labor Organization (ILO) to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and conventions on the allocation of radio air waves or the provisions of the law of the sea. The role of the diplomat is frequently that of a go-between with the technical experts and the host government bureaucrats. Although it is safe to say that no new major international organizations are likely to be created, tinkering or even comprehensive reform of many is continuously underway. Diplomats are always busy in delegations or in capitals convincing governments of the rightness of their governments' approaches to proposed changes. A perennial and vital concern is to influence the choice of leadership in these organizations. Missions employ the full scope of public diplomacy techniques to influence governments and publics. High-ranking government officials write editorials and deliver speeches; notable experts in the field are invited to speak and conduct roundtables with host country counterparts; decisionmakers are sent on USG-funded International Visitor Programs (IVP) trips for on-site exposure to the U.S. experience with the issue. The DoS, together with USTR and the USDA, used these devices in a full court press to influence skeptical European and Asian audiences about the goodness of U.S. biotechnology.
Coalition building is a key element in the economic diplomacy tool kit. Coalitions can be comprised of like-minded countries, such as the so-called Cairns group of 17 agricultural exporting countries (excluding the United States) that advocated freer trade in agricultural goods. Government and private sector cooperation is a growing phenomenon as governments realize they have neither the power nor the resources to accomplish their objectives. The American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) is a force multiplier for USG efforts to convince governments to adopt economic policies amenable to the United States. Representing potential future investment, the AMCHAM can be a more persuasive voice than the government. Moreover, it can bring more resources to the table for hosting conferences or visits.
USG resources, while never as abundant as desired, can also help achieve outcomes. The contribution of the above-mentioned EXIM, TDA, and OPIC, while not sufficient alone to convince a government to accept an American investment or buy an American export, can provide the tipping point. In the broader goal of promoting market economies, the technical assistance agencies such as the TDA provide can be critical. For example, in Azerbaijan, the TDA used assistance funds to advise the Azeri government on the transparent and sound operation of a stabilization fund. Much of the assistance funding for the former Soviet Union was directed at creating the foundation for a stable market economy. This assistance included advice on its negotiations for joining the WTO. Similarly, the EU assisted the Eastern Europe and the Baltic States in their bids to comply with EU membership requirements.
Multilateral trade agreements can be the most powerful of all instruments to liberalize trade, due to the scope and number of countries and volume of trade involved. The first such negotiations were launched in the mid-1940s, resulting in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) signed by 23 countries. Subsequent rounds focused on further tariff reductions until the Kennedy Round in the mid-1960s, which took on anti-dumping and development issues. The Tokyo Round (1973-78) went further into nontariff barriers and reform of the trading system. Uruguay (1986-94) was a major breakthrough-with the agreement to turn the GATT into an international organization, the WTO. This round was the first to approach the prickly issue of agricultural subsidies, allowed under the GATT, by establishing a timetable for liberalization of agricultural trade. Uruguay also tackled trade in services, such as banking, telecommunications, tourism, and professional services, producing the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The fate of the now-stalled Doha Round, launched in 2001, illustrates the problems of reaching agreement when the low-hanging fruit has long ago been picked. The most contentious issue in Doha is agriculture-with the developing world lined up against developing, potential agricultural exporting countries.
Regional trade agreements (RTA), involving two or more countries, not necessarily geographically adjacent, are an increasingly common method for countries to achieve both economic and political objectives. The WTO reports that as of November 15, 2011, it had received notifications for 505 RTAs and that approximately 313 are already in force. Of these, 90 percent are free trade agreements or partial scope agreements; the rest are the more comprehensive customs unions (with common tariffs for nonmembers). The United States has 20 free trade agreements. Congress approved the last three (Colombia, Korea, and Panama) in October 2011, several years after negotiations were completed. RTAs can augment and complement multilateral agreements by including agreement on complex regulations and in areas other than trade that would be too difficult to negotiate in a larger group. However, as the WTO literature points out, RTAs are discriminatory by their nature and can cause trade distortions. Their growing number leads to overlaps in membership and the potential for inconsistencies.
RTAs often have as much political as economic impact, especially for the larger partner like the EU or the United States, which can use the agreements to signal its interest in a closer political or security relationship. The EU concludes free trade agreements with potential new members as a first step in the accession process, in part to keep the candidate country interested in market reforms and the onerous accession negotiations. Similarly, the United States has concluded some 44 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFA), with individual countries or regions that are mechanisms for dialogue and consultations on trade and investment issues. Depending on the depth of our economic engagement with the partner country, these can be useful in resolving problems or simply a means to bolster the bilateral relationship. The 40 Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) designed to protect U.S. private investment and promote market oriented development are serious documents that can help substitute for strong investment laws in the recipient countries. They also promote high expectations in the smaller partner country as a sign of U.S. intent to invest in that country.
Encouraging and protecting U.S. investment is as important as securing access to export markets, although its benefits are not always as readily obvious. The DoS estimates that in 2006, Foreign Direct Investment directly or indirectly contributed 9.93 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) ($1.25 trillion) through in-bound investment, export-generation, and investor earnings.

The OECD, headquartered in Paris, whose 34-country membership comprises major marketoriented countries, is an important forum for the United States to pursue measures to eliminate obstacles to our overseas trade and investment objectives. Discussions of common problems frequently develop into agreements, conventions, or recommendations to which members and nonmembers can accede. One of the most significant initiatives of recent years is the Convention on Combating Bribery. Other conventions regard protection of foreign property and untying commercial interests for foreign assistance. The latest round of OECD expansion, however, brought to light debate over the goals of the organization. Would the organization's effectiveness be enhanced by expanding membership to encompass a larger share of the world's economy by including countries less committed to market and democratic principles, or would that decrease effectiveness by reducing decisionmaking to the lowest common denominator? The organization took a cautious step in the direction of greater inclusiveness, but the debate is still open.
Until the Eurozone crisis brought monetary and fiscal policies to the forefront of international diplomacy, financial diplomacy was not as well developed as trade and investment. Central bankers, whose independence from the political process and penchant for secrecy make financial diplomacy much less visible than trade diplomacy, are the chief practitioners of financial diplomacy. Due to its near-hegemonic position in financial markets in the second half of the 20th century, the United States tended to go its own way in financial policies. In the 1980s, the Europeans pleaded with the United States to ease its high interest rates, which were diverting European funds from needed European investment. The United States ignored these pleas for cooperation, but changed course by the mid-decade when the high dollar was choking U.S. trade competitiveness. The Europeans agreed in the Plaza Accords to intervene in currency markets to gradually devalue the U.S. dollar and raise the yen and mark.
That said, the high degree of global financial integration requires closer cooperation among monetary policymakers, as has been made clear by the flurry of international activity aimed at containing and resolving the current crisis. Domestic policy actions, such as altering exchange rates or expanding the money supply, have an impact on exchange rates and thus influence foreign markets and the value of overseas foreign currency holdings. Furthermore, financial sector reform cannot be effective unless coordinated among developed economies. The Federal Reserve and its Central Bank counterparts consult in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD, as well as Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers' Process, G-7/G-8, and the G-20. 
10
The scope of the 2008-09 crisis, however, called into question the adequacy of the existing international financial coordinating mechanisms. The IMF was called on to play a larger role in resolving the international credit crunch. The G-20 summit in April 2009 pledged to triple the IMF's lending capacity; the IMF will be issuing its own bonds, denominated in special drawing rights that could potentially become an alternative to the dollar for reserve holdings.

A few examples drawn from the author's personal experience will help illustrate the interplay of domestic and foreign policy interests and the use of various instruments. These cases are not groundbreaking in the annals of economic diplomacy, but as bilateral activities they typify the day-to-day work of economic diplomacy. We will first look at the U.S. relationship to two WTO accession cases, those of Russia and Latvia. Both countries emerged from communism as newly independent countries, albeit Russia picked up the somewhat diminished mantle of the former Soviet Union. The accession bids of Russia and Latvia were also part of the overarching goal of normalization and making Europe whole and free. However, there the similarity stops; while their accession bids were made at roughly the same time, Latvia has been a WTO member for 12 years (February 1999), while Russia did not complete negotiations until November 2011. It is important to note that while the United States is a key player in a country's accession, the process involves all WTO members, though some might choose not to participate actively. Candidate countries are bound to meet certain specific treaty requirements that begin with an exhaustive description of their trading and investment regimes. Additionally, the candidates must conclude a market access agreement with each WTO member who exercises that right.
Russia applied for membership in the WTO (then still the GATT) in 1993 and began the formal accession process the following year. Latvia submitted its official communiqué to the WTO in December 1993. In comparing the two accessions, the issue was largely the degree of political and economic interest for each side. For the Latvians, WTO accession was of paramount political and economic interest in its own right and as a necessary first step for the equally great prize of EU membership. As a very small, open-trading country with scant resources, Latvia had to have guaranteed access to other markets. (Some former republics of the Soviet Union were also motivated to complete WTO accession before the Russian Federation in order to preclude Russia from blocking their accession on political grounds.) The importance of the goal ensured unity of effort, which was able to overcome ingrained resistance to free trade among old thinkers in some parts of industry and agriculture. The United States was solidly behind Latvia in its quest and provided technical assistance for meeting accession obligations. The strength of political will, however, did not mean that Latvia was not obliged to fulfill all the treaty requirements. Given that Latvia had been fully integrated economically into the Soviet system, the scope and depth of reform necessary to meet the requirements of a fully functioning market economy were enormous.
Despite the unanimity of U.S. views toward Latvian accession, a complication arose that put the United States and the EU at loggerheads involving a perennial transatlantic dispute over broadcast media policy. The EU's broadcast directive required members to reserve, whenever possible, more than half of their television (TV) transmission time for European works ("broadcasting quotas"). The United States opposes this directive in principle, because it limits choice for consumers and restricts the ability of U.S. producers to sell programs to EU TV stations. Additionally, in this case, the United States maintained that the EU was demanding that Latvia fulfill an EU requirement before it was an EU member, in contradiction to WTO agreements. Obviously, given the small size of the Latvian market, the issue was not about U.S. economic interests in Latvia, but about setting a precedent for a larger issue of great concern to the U.S. motion picture industry. The dispute delayed Latvian accession, but was eventually resolved through compromise.
In contrast, the 17 years of the Russian WTO accession process was a prolonged series of ups and downs. Initially, in the glow of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ascendancy to power of economic reformers in Russia, the political will and economic interests were abundant in both the United States and Russia. Over time, Russian commitment to reform and openness slipped as old protectionist sentiments re-emerged. Unlike tiny Latvia, Russia is under the illusion that its market is large enough to sustain its own industry. The United States provided technical advisers for Russian accession, but the Russians did not trust them and eventually rejected the assistance. While Russian accession has been a stated U.S. foreign policy goal, economic/business as well as political interests have not always been strong enough to overcome the technical and other issues that have continued to emerge in the negotiations. Nonetheless, the United States and Russia did conclude market access negotiations in November 2006. If invited to join the WTO at the 8th WTO Ministerial, December 15-17, 2011, as expected, Russia will have until June 15, 2012, to ratify its accession package and will become a member 30 days later.
The case of "Bush legs" serves both as an example of the kind of problems that economic diplomats face with transitioning countries as well as the political dimensions that outwardly trivial trade issues can assume. U.S.-produced chicken legs were introduced to the Russian market as food aid during the early 1990s, thus acquiring the nickname of the 41st President. Cheap and nutritious, the drumsticks became a popular food among the Russian masses. However, as the Russian poultry industry began to recover, opposition to the cheap American product grew, even after the legs were being sold in Russia on commercial terms. The Russians turned to a traditional Soviet-era tool of harassment-sanitary inspection-to deal with the unwanted competition. Although absurd to anyone who has visited a Russian outdoor market, the Russian agriculture ministry insisted that American producers did not meet Russian sanitary standards. The United States attempted to counter these accusations by arranging meetings of experts and visits by Russian phytosanitary officials to American chicken-processing facilities. The issue rose to the very highest levels in the bilateral relationship. The United States achieved small and temporary victories, but the force of corruption and vested interests on the Russian side have precluded a definitive solution to this day. Russia absorbs 29.2 percent of American broiler exports, with leg quarters making up most of that figure . 12 Moreover, poultry is exported from nearly every U.S. state-all of which have very concerned congressional representatives. Consequently, Congress lost any interest in overturning the hated Jackson-Vanik Amendment on Jewish emigration from the former Soviet Union. The political loss for the Russians far exceeded the short-term increase in domestic poultry sales.
U.S. intervention in the case of the criminally caused collapse of Latvia's major bank illustrates the simultaneous pursuit of two of the objectives of economic diplomacy: promoting the development of market economies and fighting international economic crime. Latvians awoke one spring day in 2005 to learn that the bank that had been paying fantastic interest rates was "empty." Economists predicted the bank's collapse would cause the Latvian GDP to drop by several percentage points-a sharp blow to a struggling country eager to join the EU, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the WTO. The banking system had developed very rapidly in Latvia after the collapse of communism with a huge number of banks for the size of the economy. Many of those banks were "pocket banks," which functioned principally as the financial arm of an economic enterprise. Baltija, however, was a large bank that sought out both commercial and consumer business. The lack of good laws and regulatory institutions, and the country's apparent stability, made Latvian banks attractive as a place to park and launder ill-gotten gains for business people further to the East. The owner of Baltija, a chess champion with known ties to organized crime, took the game a step further with an elaborate series of false loans and fictitious companies.
The Latvian government was eager for U.S. assistance in resolving the crisis. The Embassy responded with a two-track approach that reflected our dual concerns. On the development side, USAID bolstered its financially related technical assistance by providing experts to shore up the regulatory and bank supervisory system. To deal with the financial crime aspect, the Embassy requested Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assistance to help the Latvians sort through the complicated web of criminal financial transactions. The FBI invited law enforcement experts from Latvia and several nearby countries in which Baltija had been involved, including Russia, to participate in the investigation. The FBI was not able to get deeply involved in the investigation because there was no direct U.S. connection, but the hands-on training and contacts with U.S. law enforcement were very useful. Moreover, the wake-up call of the bank's failure gave the U.S. diplomats the opening to talk to the Latvian government about the necessity of drafting tough anti-money laundering legislation. The Latvian Central Bank and Finance Ministry were very receptive to the message and reversed their earlier reluctance to impose restrictions on money flows. The United States was able to increase its persuasiveness with technical assistance on drafting and implementing the legislation. By moving quickly and combining the tools of economic diplomacy, the United States was able to advance its economic agenda and strengthen its political relationship with Latvia. Timely action on the Latvian side also prevented the bank collapse from spilling over into the rest of the economy and limited the impact on its GDP to only one percent of lost growth.
While economic diplomacy shares much in common with traditional political diplomacy, many peculiarities of economics complicate the work of the economic diplomat. The most significant difference is that foreign relations are still largely in the domain of governments, but economic relations are formed by the interactions of the (largely) private sectors. Governments negotiate the international operating rules and regulations; how those rules are interpreted or whether they are followed in the real economy is beyond the scope of government officials. Another complication in economic diplomacy is the tension between economic and political priorities. An economic desire to exploit a potential market calls for bringing out all the tools available to the USG for trade promotion, but the country's record on human rights violations, trafficking in persons, support to terrorists, or neglect of democratic norms creates a dilemma for policymakers. As much as promoting economic prosperity, these are a part of U.S. national interests, and are often embodied in U.S. law. Conversely, policymakers are often hesitant to address violations of our economic and business interests if the potential damage to the bilateral relationship might have serious conse-quences for national security. The debate extends to use of foreign assistance and the promotion of democratic vice economic reform. One school of thought maintains that assistance on economic reform -generally better received by the host government than democratic reform -is more effective and can eventually lead to democratic development. The other side argues that economic assistance props up the undemocratic governments at the expense of limited resources for the support of democratic reform.
Two global trends that heavily influence the conduct of foreign relations-globalization and the "rise of the rest"-are largely economic phenomena and therefore profoundly change the nature of economic diplomacy. The real internationalization of companies and production poses some serious dilemmas for trade officials seeking to promote U.S. business. Should one lobby on behalf of a U.S.-based company if the production takes places outside of the United States? Should the United States lobby for a foreign company whose production is largely in the United States? What about a company that is not U.S.-based, but in which Americans are the majority stockholders? Ten years ago, the author found herself in the odd position of joining with an Austrian diplomat to lobby their host governments on behalf of a formerly U.S.-owned company, now owned by an Austrian conglomerate, that was trying to sell massive turbines manufactured in Pennsylvania. For large exports, production can take place in many countries. For years, the USG has supported Boeing in its rivalry with the European Airbus, although, in fact, American companies located in the United States make major Airbus components such as engines.
When Western countries and companies operating with a Western business ethos dominated the global economy, negotiating consensus on international rules was much easier than today. The shift of economic weight to countries without such a business tradition makes coming to an agreement much more difficult. This issue came into play during the OECD's recent enlargement exercise. Is it better to bring the new economic leaders into the rule-making process, rather than exclude them, at the risk of diluting consensus? While these developments make the job more difficult, they also underscore the increased importance of economic diplomacy. The rise of nonlikeminded stakeholders calls for a greater need for global rules and regulations. More skillful economic diplomats are needed to find and build areas of consensus. Furthermore, as the nature of conflict has become more regional and sub-national, and more likely to be caused or exacerbated by economic hardship and disparity, attention to economic tools is more important. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate that building infrastructure, developing open markets, and securing transparent contracts are critical to ending conflict.
The financial crises of the past 3 to 4 years -and more importantly-their global nature, has made clear the importance of economics to national security. As we have seen, there are a host of tools and resources that practitioners of the craft of economic diplomacy use to promote a country's economic interests. Current global trends are likely to increase the role of economics in our conduct of foreign relations at the same time those same trends make wielding the economic instrument increasingly difficult.

Modern conflict, from conventional warfare to diplomatic disputes, has increasingly involved economics in some form. Nations use economic tools to pursue objectives, seek economic resources as national goals, or are affected by economic events that influence their national security. Both state and non-state actors use economic power to wage war and to influence events regionally or globally. Economic considerations range from simple access to resources like water or raw materials through transforming resources into finished products or services to providing financial resources. The ability to gather, transform, and use resources is a key component of national security. Many human activities, including those involving national security, can be either severely limited or dramatically enhanced by economic factors. Military operations and other national security actions frequently depend on the results of economic capability. Without the capacity to produce, finance, or support key national security activities, a nation would have a limited ability to protect its domestic and international interests.
Economic power has spread widely and gained importance in recent years. Globalization, the reliance on economics, and the diffusion of economic power from a few industrial states to many developing ones has radically changed the world. Global economic success has also conferred power on a large group of sovereign governments and even corporations. The threat or actual action by a government, organization, or cartel can create enormous economic impact. Markets are extremely sensitive to news that would affect potential financial or economic activity. Oil prices can rise rapidly if tensions increase in the Persian Gulf or if a natural disaster occurs. Single events with little obvious international significance could ignite a sell-off by investors in overseas and domestic stock markets. Global communications can spread panic and exacerbate the condition.
The changing environment has altered the emphasis on national elements of power so that military power is not necessarily the primary coercive tool in international relations, and economic power has gained increased importance. During the age of total war that spanned World Wars I and II, military power was the coin of the realm in foreign affairs. Economic power played a role in those wars, but the fight for national survival overrode the impact of domestic and international macroeconomic stability or growth. Economics served primarily as a provider of resources to the military element of power. In an era of increased consumer demand, technological growth, changes in society, and the evolving nature of conflict, the importance of economic considerations rose. During the Cold War, national survival was still at stake, but even then economic considerations became just as important as nuclear parity with the Soviet Union. President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of military expenditures impeding future economic growth-the net result of which would degrade security for the nation. The Kennedy administration raised questions regarding how much defense spending was sufficient to ensure national security. The United States engaged the Soviet Union in a nuclear arms race while it fought a war in Vietnam, but Washington tempered its strategy to constrain defense spending. Nuclear sufficiency became acceptable, rather than superiority with the associated costly numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, and submarines. "Guns versus butter" questions also arose as the challenges of an undeclared Cold War against Moscow pitted social spending against defense resources.
Today, economic issues play a pivotal role in conflict. Advanced technology, contractors on the battlefield, volunteer militaries (which tend to be more expensive than conscript armies), reconstruction of battle-ravaged nations, and other considerations make war and conflict expensive. Countries do not have inexhaustible resources to conduct long wars even if there is a direct and desperate threat to national survival. Questions of national treasury, consumer demand, labor constraints, finance, and other economic considerations can sway public sentiment against a conflict. If one nation wages war or takes other actions to isolate another state, investors around the world become nervous. Stock and commodity markets could affect financial conditions and create unforeseen reactions. These reactions may create adverse conditions that could force a change in strategy by the nation trying to influence a rival's behavior.
As economic issues affect national security capabilities and activities, so might efforts that involve national security create global economic impacts. War or political disruption in an oilproducing region will initiate tremors in the international energy sector. Although a nation might not be directly affected by the initial problem, the populace can suffer from increased prices from petroleum products, which could result in greater unemployment, inflation, credit issues, and foreign exchange problems. Demands for added military expenditures could translate to increased taxes that discourage consumer spending and business investment or reductions in other governmental activities that can directly shape the economic landscape. Competition for limited resources to meet national security policy objectives could also hamper private or other governmental activities. Nations can increase borrowing, raise taxes, spend surpluses, confiscate resources, or monetize debt. All of these options have unique economic effects on a nation.
Economics is an element of national power. Normally, one of a nation's key national interests is maintaining a viable economy to ensure a certain standard of living for its citizenry. States can use economic power to deter, compel, coerce, fight, and even rebuild a former opponent to meet a particular need. Economics becomes a vital component of the ends, ways, and means of security. Perhaps uniquely among the traditional elements of national power, economics might be any of the three aspects of strategy-the objective of a nation's strategy might be economic; economics might provide the means to achieve the end; or a nation might pursue its ends, using economics as the primary way to exert power. Whether economics is a way or a means to achieve a national interest or if it is a cause or motivation to take an action, national leaders must play attention to this increasingly significant security factor.
States and non-state actors have historically fought over economic issues. Wars about open access to resources, trade routes, competition, profit, and other economic issues are common in military and diplomatic history. A keen competition for resources among governments, individuals, corporations, and other actors has created a complex web of economic dependencies and rivalries that was not as important in the past. Similarly, economic conditions can create an environment that fosters demands for change that could create a civil war, a fight for access to markets or resources, or other forms of economic competition. Countries with weak or failing economies may resort to actions that they might not have considered had their economies been stronger.
One specific area that deserves a brief discussion is oil as a cause or objective of war. Reliable access to oil at reasonable rates is a vital national security interest for every developed and many of the more-developing nations. Governments or international organizations that control oil production or pricing can effectively disrupt global economic conditions-whether purposefully or accidentally. A monopoly or oligopoly that controls a strategic asset, capability, or raw material has great potential to disrupt economies and create political instability, although few commodities have the same potential impact as oil. Major perceived or actual disruptions in the oil market are serious events that easily can trigger hostile responses from concerned governments. Today, oil is the best example of a resource that is both scarce and vital; however, other resources like water are also likely sources of conflict. We can expect economic issues-particularly access to raw materials and resources-to remain one of the significant objectives of international relations and causes of conflict.
Differentiating whether economics is being used as the ways or means of strategy or policymaking can be difficult. The distinction is often in the eye of the beholder. Fortunately, making a fine distinction between ways and means is not necessary for the purposes of this article. Thus, we will discuss the two together-fully recognizing they are distinctly different functions in the strategy and policy process.
One prerequisite for maintaining long-term government activities is a strong and vibrant economy. The economy serves as the source of government revenue. In the short term, assuming a nation has a relatively resilient economy, a government can spend money fairly freely without serious consequences. However, that is not true in the long term. Government actions like high taxes, irresponsible borrowing, or spending surpluses under a failing or substandard economy will ultimately create political and economic conditions that will create significant future problems. In a national emergency, a government can take a number of actions to raise vital capital. During World War II, the U.S. Government spent massive amounts of funds to fight the war. Despite lingering effects from the global 1929 depression, the Treasury Department started to raise revenues for military and foreign aid expenditures before the U.S. entry into the war. Congress passed two key tax increases in 1940 and 1941 on individual and corporate taxes. Tax rates and the requirements on who must file income taxes expanded to fund the war. Simultaneously, War and Navy Department demands for weapons and personnel injected a fiscal stimulus into the economy that allowed some of the sustained tax increases. In 1940, Washington collected about $5.4 billion from individual and corporate taxpayers; by 1945, collections rose to $46.5 billion.

The U.S. Government could raise custom duties on imported goods, but during World War II the market for consumer imports was small. Most of the imported goods and raw materials went to the war effort; raising prices on those was counterproductive.
Another major way to pay for military and other national security-related expenditures was through public debt. During the Great Depression, Washington used a number of public works projects to employ people who had lost their jobs. By 1940, the public debt was about $3.7 billion; it ballooned to $53.9 billion at the end of the war. The federal government conducted a series of massive bond drives to fund World War II. The public was encouraged to lend excess cash to the government. Repayment would be made later with interest, so bond sales placed the burden of war expenditures on future taxpayers, unlike raising taxes during the conflict. Additionally, the government reissued bonds that reached maturity rather than paying them off. These policies would limit future discretionary government spending, but the war took precedence. During the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration was initially unwilling to raise taxes to pay for military operations in Southeast Asia and to support new domestic social programs. Raising taxes to fight an unpopular war would be difficult. Instead, the Federal Reserve System used its ability to sell Treasury securities to finance government debt-an action it had not taken since 1951. The Federal Reserve System acquiesced to the Johnson administration to fund the war through massive bond sales. 
2
Countries could monetize their government budget deficits. The government could simply print or coin more money for its expenditures. Unless the money is not backed by some standard, like gold, this action only cheapens its currency and may produce undesirable effects like inflation. These negative impacts can be severely injurious to an economy. In many respects, one could argue the selling of Treasury securities acts to monetize government deficits.
Related to deficit spending is supporting another nation's debt. Global open trading of official government securities allows a state to use its economic power to assist a friend by underwriting his debt. Buying another nation's securities can transfer resources to that nation immediately. Additionally, the aid provided must be repaid, which eliminates some of the stigma of a grant or aid and often makes the strategy more politically palatable at home. The only "cost" to the securities purchaser is the upfront expense and time to recover repayment. However, the purchaser also bears a risk of default if the government seller of the securities falls, losses a war, or suffers some other catastrophic collapse. Short of such drastic events that make repayment impossible, the risk of default may be manageable. Debtor countries may not be able to make payments on schedule, but they generally attempt to repay debt in the long run. Reneging on debt repayment might provide short-term benefits to a debtor nation strapped for cash, but default devastates future credibility in the security market. Conversely, if a sovereign power purchases securities, it acquires some influence, at least theoretically, over the debtor country. The power resides in the lender's ability to demand or withhold demands for repayment or to hold or sell the securities on the international market. Threats to sell the debtor nation's securities could weaken its currency, cause a drop in the value of the securities, or drain resources from the government depending on the conditions of the bond. However, exercising the power inherent in holding the debt of another nation is not a costless tactic. As the lending country starts to sell, the price of the securities will begin to fall. The amount of the decline will vary with the magnitude and timing of the sales. At some point, the sell-off becomes economically counterproductive, as the value the seller receives falls below what he paid for the securities. In the case of a massive sell-off, the targeted country could actually benefit, since it can repurchase its debt at discounted prices-assuming it can generate the necessary funds to purchase the securities.
Economic intervention in or withdrawal from the economy of a foreign nation-as opposed to supporting its debt-can have tremendous impact on the financial well-being of a region or country. Governments do not usually participate directly in the economy of another nation. However, direct participation in the economy of another nation through private companies is widespread. Depending on the business and political climate of firm's home state, such participation may provide some degree of power for that home state. Regardless of the degree of external governmental control, decisions by private firms and multinational corporations to invest or do business in a country can influence national policies. Such decisions are independent and can be contrary to a host nation's interests. In an age of globalized financial markets, almost any corporation, organization, or individual can transfer capital into a country or take it out. This transfer generally can occur by using national or international stock, bond, commodity markets, or through direct investment into business ventures. Rapid inflow of capital can provide a needed boast to growth, while rapid outflow can sink a nation into recession.
Governments can use their economic power through other means. For example, rather than lending money by bond purchases, they can provide direct support to another nation through a variety of programs that essentially provide money or services. Foreign aid, loan guarantees, technical aid and services, and other assistance can provide a number of flexible tools to support national interests. The State Department distributes foreign aid in support of national policy objectives that include sustaining and strengthening key allies. Another use of the economic tool is to fight one of the major causes of global strife today, failed states. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides help to nations to fight poverty. Poor economic health frequently breeds political conflict and potential civil war in a state. Economically poor regions often become breeding grounds for terrorists. USAID promotes economic development through humanitarian relief, food and commodity aid, training, construction, technical support, small-enterprise or micro-loans, credit guarantees, human health aid, and fostering economic growth to a market economy. This aid can strengthen fragile states, support transformational development, support geostrategic interests, address global and regional issues, and provide humanitarian relief.

The transfer of wealth from developed to developing countries that sell raw materials or manufacture low-cost products can create economic problems. Governments worried about the outflow of capital, goods, services, industries, and jobs might erect barriers to restrict or stop trade. Such actions rarely go unchallenged, and a counter-tariff barrier or legal challenge is a likely response. Conversely, governments willing to accept what are hopefully temporary trade imbalances for potential future benefits may allow the transfer of wealth and even industries and jobs to continue. Such is the political and economic theory behind the whole free trade movement-the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) being a visible example. Transfer of key technologies, processes, equipment, or skills can also enable foreign governments and private firms-granting in some cases access to capabilities that would have taken years and many resources to acquire independently.
Economic power normally involves the trade of finished goods or raw materials. Few countries can claim to produce all of the goods and services that their citizens use. Many nations require energy imports to subsist. Conversely, nations that may have oil, natural gas, or other energy sources might need food imports or other foreign services like skilled labor. Nations can work within international trade agreements, or they may take unilateral action to expand or restrict trade. A country might try to limit trade to hurt a rival. A government may impose import or export quotas, limit certain business activities, set requirements for strict "quality" standards for imports, designate excessive administrative requirements to import the items, enact tariffs or taxes on selective foreign goods, subsidize domestic competition to make the imports appear more expensive, dump or sell large quantities of goods at a much lower price than a foreign opponent to destroy competition, enact laws to force citizens to purchase only domestic products, or other measures. A major concern about enacting such measures is retaliation by the injured state, other nations, and organizations such as the World Trade Organization. Trade imbalances and currency fluctuations can also have adverse impact on domestic and global markets.
Economic power could also prevent or limit actions taken by a rival. Suppose a country requires a scarce raw material. If an adversary has sufficient funds, influence, or credit, it could purchase and withhold that raw material from its foe. The nation could also coerce sellers to prevent the sale of that raw material to the opponent. States could put pressure indirectly on an opponent's allies to force a nation to take certain actions. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab oil-producing countries refused to sell oil to the United States and other nations that supported Israel. This embargo boosted oil prices and shifted international power from the developed nations to ones that relied primarily on oil extraction. Political and economic power was redistributed when these actions were combined with the nationalization of private, foreign-owned petroleum companies in these oil-exporting nations.

The classic uses of economic power as coercive tools are embargoes, blockades, and sanctions. All of these are aggressive, hostile actions intended to restrict the target's economic access to the global economy. While often the first tool thought of, none of these are without disadvantage. Blockade, for example, is an act of war-not even considering the legal and practical necessity to make it effective by positioning naval forces to enforce the declaration. Sanctions work best when they are multilateral, massive, immediate, and used to achieve relatively minor policy changes from countries that value world opinion. Economic sanctions work poorly as a tool to coerce significant policy shifts, and they work best when used against countries where the common people, who are most immediately and directly affected by any sanction, have some political power. The imposing countries always suffer some economic cost, since cutting off trade to a nation means you lose the value of that trade as well as the target. Also, there are usually nations that for political or economic reasons are willing to trade with sanctioned nations; they reap a benefit while undermining the effectiveness of the sanction.
Although not generally controlled by governments, disregarding currency manipulations designed to offset them, commercial balance of payments are another form of debt that can have foreign policy implications. The United States has been a major recipient of surplus foreign savings that has allowed the nation to purchase imports and pay for its current account deficit. From 1999 to 2006, foreign sources have lent America $4.4 trillion, about 85 percent of foreign surplus savings.

Multinational corporations and firms typically have the resources and ability to get access to once-closed markets. Governments might offer subsidies or grant special benefits to attract business to their country. Once established, the multinational corporation could exert a powerful influence on the government, since its affairs affect the nation's economy. Similarly, in highly contested markets, a multinational corporation could offer restricted technologies, move production of key subcomponents, offer bribes, expand production beyond the initial plan, or provide other incentives to gain access to the market. Companies can lobby their home country's government (assuming it favors the move into the other nation's market) for help lifting trade restrictions or access to technology or for influencing the host nation's foreign policy.
In the most basic sense, economic power is an entity's ability to acquire, produce, and use raw materials, goods, and services. A nation cannot engage in conflict over an extended period without an adjustment to its economy. In many cases, countries must devote goods or services to prepare for or fight a war or even to conduct other activities that affect the national interest. Humanitarian aid, defense expenditures, diplomacy, alliance membership, and other vital actions depend on a country's ability to raise and spend tax revenues, borrow funds, use surpluses, or finance these measures. Economic power allows players to conduct actions by providing the personnel, equipment, operating materials, infrastructure, and short-or long-term sustainment of that capability. Governments purchase commodities and equipment like a business, obtain labor (military, government civilian, and contractor), maintain physical infrastructure, conduct research and development, and in some cases also produce unique goods and services peculiar to national security. The government funds these capabilities by extracting resources from the public and businesses that must sacrifice their own economic well-being. Within the government, the competition for resources is very tough, especially in times when the domestic economy has a downturn that may limit funding of large or new initiatives. Skeptical lawmakers and the executive branch that must choose between these requirements and other programs of national interest must be convinced that military or diplomatic programs are the best use of scarce resources.
Resource decisions mold the creation of force structure to include investments in weapons, recruitment and retention of military and civilian personnel, decisions to fund military or nonmilitary government programs, and a host of other concerns that affect national security policy. Further, economic conditions-once the exclusive concern of financial institutions, investors, and businesses-now affect military decisions that range from recruitment to government borrowing that directly influences a power's ability to provide military capability. Arms sales, transfers of key military technologies or technologies related to weapons of mass destruction, contracting for goods and services by individuals and firms, and other economic activities can influence the national security environment.
Nations that have sufficient resources can upgrade their military forces with more and better capabilities. Military forces that lack personnel or equipment could rely on contracted services or purchase advanced weaponry from other nations. If the state has limited forces, it can change the composition of its military forces by hiring specialized services that would have taken years to develop or that they only need for a limited time. Contractors on the battlefield are not new phenomena. The U.S. Government has used contractors in several wars. Other nations have hired military pilots and aircraft, logistics, and combat forces to expand and enhance their limited capabilities. Today, governments can lease satellite communications, photographic imagery, multispectral analysis, and navigational systems that were once the province of superpowers that had exclusive use of space systems. Individuals, firms, and governments can use these functions-for a price. This capability can change a balance of power at critical times during a conflict.
Economic success empowers nations with new capital, technology, raw materials, and influence. This can be translated into military power and allow a formerly impoverished nation to complicate another state's security. For example, after the end of the Cold War the Russian Federation could not compete economically with free nations. A culture of economic inefficiency based on state-owned enterprises and centrally planned economies destroyed entrepreneurship, investment, and innovation. The Russian economy was barely alive. Russia turned to raw materials exploitation to include natural gas and oil. Demand for energy has expanded, and with problems in the Middle East, oil prices have risen greatly. Russia's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measure of the country's total value of consumption, government, investment, and foreign trade, rose 64 percent from 2000 to 2008. In comparison, the real GDP of the United States increased by 18 percent over the same period. Oil profits have allowed the Russian government to finance a larger military budget, which has given Moscow the ability to build a new intercontinental ballistic missile, aircraft, and other weapons to revitalize its national security and foreign policies. Other countries, like Iran and Venezuela, also fuel their defense and security programs by oil sales. Nations building advanced technology consumer goods like information systems could use similar technologies to improve their military forces.
While national leaders consider and adapt economics as an element of national power, these same leaders are also affected by economic events that may limit their policies options. Economic considerations can have very influential impacts on the conduct of military operations and diplomatic actions. Globalization has allowed nations to conduct business with allies, former enemies, and potential rivals. New relationships between citizens and governments that highlight cost reductions, profits, and long-range business activities can impact national security measures in a host of ways.
Government expenditures, borrowing, taxes, and other direct financial effects on a nation's public, financial markets, and business can skew short-term consumption and longer-term investment. The challenges government faces in the economic realm are not limited to these direct effects. A wider scope of national economic health is involved. The ability to pay for national security or the influence of foreign policies on business may strongly shape operations. Conversely, certain international events that affect a country's economic health may heighten support for aggressive national security policies. For example, policies that advocate the use of naval forces to arrest criminals or stop piracy would be hailed by a number of individuals from international shippers, insurers, consumers of goods transiting the area, and producers of exported and imported goods and raw materials.
Current economic conditions also have a large impact on military operations. Inflation contributes to reduced purchasing power by a government. This includes activities from purchasing fuel, paying for contracted work, demands for greater pay for military and civilian workers, and other acquisition activities. Similarly, a recession-a sustained downturn in economic activities-reduces tax revenues and encourages moves by politicians to stimulate the economy or support the unemployed or struggling citizens. These policies can significantly reduce the amount of defense spending for a nation. However, some of these conditions might provide relief to the government. Unemployment may ease recruitment and retention problems in the military. Increased competition for fewer government contracts might reduce the cost of operations. Tools to fight economic problems may also create unforeseen issues. A central bank could raise or lower interest rates. These actions can affect the availability of investors to purchase government debt and the cost of borrowing for contractors to build the latest fighter aircraft.
Economic crises can, if left unchecked, create an environment that leads to political upheaval and disintegration. A victorious British and French Allied delegation demanded economic reparations from Imperial Germany at Versailles after World War I. That move was partly a punishment and partly a way to repair the financial and economic problems caused in France and Britain during the war. A defeated Germany now faced the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, coal mining rights in the Saar for 15 years, territory in eastern Germany, and the payment of financial reparations. The German government was willing to pay damages to civilians and civilian property due to the war. Britain and France wanted Germany to admit guilt for the war and pay damages for the entire cost of the conflict, to include their loans from the United States. There was no fixed sum for the war debt during the surrender negotiations, and Germany was unable to start payment immediately. Instead, the Allies demanded that payments of $5 billion per year be made until 1921. The Allies would later issue a final accounting of war costs, and Germany would pay the remainder for another 30 years.

Expanding trade can provide several benefits to nations. It can create better efficiencies in production by seeking the lowest-cost, most-effective producers. This situation could lead to greater economic growth and improved standards of living around the world. However, not all nations find an economic niche that allows economic growth. Cheaper outsourced services and imported goods may destroy domestic industries. Large numbers of unemployed workers could create domestic problems for a government. Further, reliance on foreign imports could impoverish the state and complicate its financial and credit situation. If nations rely on foreign goods, then any problem that hinders trade could cause issues globally. A natural disaster, potential conflict, trade dispute, or other problem could restrict the flow of needed products.
Modern economic crises have had greater impact on nations than they might have in the past. Global investment and business have tied disparate business partners to global ventures as diverse as manufacturing computers and call center services. What used to threaten domestic economies can now become the basis for a worldwide economic crisis. In mid-1997, the Thai currency, the baht, collapsed due to a number of reasons to include overvaluation of the baht, poor financial systems, overextended credit, and a construction and real estate "bubble." Banks, financial institutions, investors, and citizens started to panic and pull their money out of Thailand. They demanded payment in American dollars. Riots ensued in Bangkok and throughout Thailand. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund took action. The Thai government almost collapsed. Investors lost millions of dollars, and the panic spread to South Korea and then throughout Asia. The contagion jumped as far as Latin America and Russia. Today, a quick glance at any copy of a financial newspaper will reveal issues from oil production problems, credit concerns, or other local problems that have the potential to create another global crisis and instability in almost any region of the world.
Government financial or policy changes actions can also shape the domestic markets in the short and long terms in ways that can affect a state's health and security. The attacks on New York, Washington, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, shook global financial markets. Investors and firms were concerned about global market panic. The terrorist attacks on New York were partly intended to target Wall Street, which meant there were global financial implications. Immediately, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department stepped in to assure financial markets. Some of their actions included expanded bank borrowing opportunities to increase consumption among firms and individuals, ensuring the bond market that adequate Treasury securities were available for trading to compensate for bond trading offices that had been destroyed, and injecting funds into the economy by purchasing Treasury securities through open market operations.

Today, the United States faces economic problems from a global recession. Financial issues caused by massive mortgage and banking problems created a credit crisis that spread worldwide. Unemployment, failed businesses from the automobile industry to small firms, government bailouts, huge private and public debt, and falling consumer confidence have affected societies, governments, and individuals. These problems have created questions about the future of international trade agreements, credit, funding federal discretionary programs, and the dollar's value relative to other currencies. A solution to the government deficit by some is a reduction in the defense budget, foreign aid, and other areas that influence directly on several national security capabilities.
Similarly, a government could take a number of domestic economic actions to settle cyclic downturns and uncontrolled growth. Injection of funds into an economy like tax rate reductions, increased aid from extended unemployment benefits, entitlement and other income supplements, tax rebates, greater federal programs aimed at expanding employment, and other programs could provide stimuli to help turn a struggling economy toward recovery. Federal programs that target certain industries could provide areas of new growth or repair damaged ones. Investment in energy programs, advanced technology, and other programs could in time provide solutions to some key economic problems. Although expensive, these programs could head off massive unemployment and social disruption that may create political issues and unrest. Legislation to reduce prices, like petroleum and other limited products, is an oft-mentioned option. Price and wage controls normally do not work. These are temporary measures that lapse and leave the underlying reasons for the crisis unresolved.
War and conflict has always been an expensive proposition. Spending national treasure to fight for sovereignty or survival is normally an unquestioned policy choice. Debate about participating in smaller, limited wars that do not involve a vital national interest is another matter. Limited budgets create competition among government agencies, the public, and other interested parties that can result in bitter debates between guns and butter priorities. A public accustomed to receiving generous social, health, or income redistribution programs would object to greater demands to spend on national defense, foreign aid, or other activities that absorb discretionary funds that might otherwise be added to social spending. National leaders might be forced to curtail or end funding for a conflict. In extreme situations, such considerations may radically affect foreign policy.
Defense spending in the United States is the largest single expense for national security purposes. Budgetary pressure has mounted to reduce defense spending to pursue other types of federal programs. During the height of the Cold War, defense spending consumed approximately 6 percent of the nation's GDP. In 2000, the amount of defense spending had fallen to 2.1 percent of GDP. After September 11, 2001, the defense budget increased greatly to fund operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and homeland defense. The defense budget's share of GDP more than doubled to 4.7 percent. In 2007, Washington spent $622 billion on defense that included $173 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

National leaders can take several paths. If all government programs are fully funded, leaders must find new sources of federal revenue. Increased taxes are an obvious source of resources, but may come at the expense of future economic growth, since individual and business investment and consumption may react negatively to tax increases. Borrowing the funds may damage future business investment due to interest rate hikes to attract capital to purchase securities. Large federal budget deficits can strangle the economy by siphoning investment funds from individuals and firms. Additionally, corporations compete for the same investment funds, so the interest rates they pay will rise. In 2000, the federal debt amounted to $5.6 trillion; by 2008 the estimated debt is poised to jump to $9.5 trillion.

There are only a few nations that can possibly pose a military challenge to the United States in a conventional conflict. There are fewer still that possess nuclear weapons with the appropriate delivery systems to threaten major American cities. In the future, security conflict among nations may change from predominately military contests to ones primarily featuring other elements of national power. That option is also open to non-state actors. While there has always been economic competition, the conscious, planned, coercive use of economic power as the main tool to achieve national security objectives has been largely uncommon in American history. Moving to the use of non-military instruments of power to accomplish national security goals will take greater integration, coordination, planning, vision, time, and patience.
Using economics as an element of power will require consideration of a host of issues and unintended effects. National leaders will find numerous challenges from domestic and international camps that will complicate and constrain policy options. In the past, the American public has been largely spared from sustained, large-scale military actions inside the national borders. That may not be the case with economic conflicts. If the nation uses a trade sanction to force another country to change its behavior, it may be targeted with its own set of counter-sanctions. Suppose that Washington applies trade restrictions against a country. That country could seize assets of American-owned firms, organize a boycott of American-made goods and services, ban the sale of critical raw materials, or undertake other retaliatory acts. That does not even consider the opportunity cost of lost potential trade with the target country. Many or most American citizens could suffer from higher prices, less choice, unemployment, or other economic disruption. The resulting political pressure could influence national decisionmaking.
National security issues involving economics will only expand in the future. Global economic growth has introduced new powerhouses like China and India that complicate American national security and foreign policy decisions. Economic tools, once the province of a few developed countries, are now available to many developing and smaller powers. If these states can cause economic disruption, they can influence the behavior not only of regional rivals but of nations around the world. Small states, non-state actors, or even super-empowered individuals who have the economic ability to turn a local action into a global one must be expected to use that power to their advantage. In the past, such actors might have constrained their foreign policy, due to a lack of military power or in the case of non-state and individual actors been incapable of exerting effective influence. Today, economic power or leverage could allow those entities to become more proactive and willing to flex their muscles in the belief their economic power will deter an opponent's military power. Conflict by pocketbook could spread from a localized disagreement to a global one. Globalized markets and the dependence of nations on one another have made them vulnerable to many new threats; economic ones will find a greater place on the world stage in the future.
Force without wisdom falls of its own weight.
International politics is a struggle for power. Power, in the international arena, is used to protect a nation's interests by influencing potential competitors or partners. The most important instrument of power available to a nation-state is military power. "In international politics in particular," according to Hans Morgenthau, "armed strength as a threat or a potentiality is the most important material factor making for the political power of a nation."

As important as military power is to the functioning of the international system, it is a very expensive and dangerous tool of statecraft-one, as Robert Art recently pointed out, that should not be exercised without a great deal of wisdom:
Using military power correctly does not ensure that a state will protect all of its interests, but using it incorrectly would put a great burden on these other instruments and could make it impossible for a state to achieve its goals. Decisions about whether and how to use military power may therefore be the most fateful a state makes.

Despite all of the changes that have occurred in world politics since the end of the Cold War, there is, in many respects, an underlying continuity with earlier eras. The recent conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and mass-casualty terrorism are evidence that the use of military power as an instrument of political purpose remains as relevant today as in the past. Clausewitz's famous dictum continues to ring true, "that war [the application of military power] should never be thought of as something autonomous but always as an instrument of policy," and that "war is simply a continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means." While still serving as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell analyzed the military successes that the United States had experienced through most of the 1990s. The principal reason for these achievements, he concluded, "is that in every instance we have matched the use of military force to our political objectives."

Military power can be used in its purest sense to defeat an adversary physically. United States military doctrine clearly articulates this objective as the fundamental purpose of military powerto fight and win the nation's wars. Although recognizing other, potential non-combat objectives, U.S. doctrine argues that "success in combat in defense of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, societal values, and national interests is the essential goal and measure of the profession of arms in American society."

Because of the high cost and uncertainty associated with combat operations, a nation's primary strategic objective is usually an attempt to cause an adversary to accede to one's demands short of war or actual combat operations. As such, most states attempt to achieve their goals through coercion. Successful coercion is not warfighting, but is the use of threatened force-including the
Defeat: eliminate an adversary's ability to choose courses of action.
Coerce: cause an adversary to change his potential or actual course of action.
Compel: make an adversary take beneficial actions. limited use of actual force to back up that threat-to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would. Coercion relies on the threat of future military force to influence an adversary's decisionmaking.

Deterrence, in its broadest sense, means persuading an opponent not to initiate a specific action because the perceived benefits do not justify the estimated costs and risks. Deterrence can be based on punishment, which involves a threat to destroy what the adversary values, or on denial, which requires convincing an opponent that he will not achieve his goals on the battlefield. In either case, the adversary is assumed to be willing and able to engage in well-informed cost-benefit calculations and respond rationally on the basis of those calculations. An irrational (or ill-informed) opponent who will accept destruction or disproportionate loss may not be deterrable.

• Extended and central deterrence (the former alludes to endeavors to extend deterrent coverage over friends and allies; the latter to the deterrence of attack upon one's homeland).
Examples continue to abound concerning extended deterrence-one particularly difficult issue concerns the U.S. security guarantees extended to Taiwan.
There are two challenges to the future deterrent posture of U.S. forces. The first is the ongoing issue of trying to evaluate the effectiveness of a deterrent policy. The willingness of a legislative body to allocate resources to various elements of military power is normally contingent on recognition of beneficial results. Henry Kissinger aptly describes the problem:
Since deterrence can only be tested negatively, by events that do not take place, and since it is never possible to demonstrate why something has not occurred, it became especially difficult to assess whether existing policy was the best possible policy or a just barely effective one. Perhaps deterrence was unnecessary because it was impossible to prove whether the adversary ever intended to attack in the first place.

Compellence is the use of military power to change an adversary's behavior. It attempts to reverse an action that has already occurred or to otherwise overturn the status quo. Examples include evicting an aggressor from territory it has just conquered or convincing a proliferating state to abandon its nuclear weapons program. According to Thomas Schelling, who initially coined the term, "Compellence…usually involves initiating action that can cease, or become harmless, only if the opponent responds."

Finally, there are two other political objectives listed on Figure

31
The final political objective is dissuasion, sometimes presented as the ultimate purpose of both defense and deterrence-that is, persuading others not to take actions harmful to oneself. The notion here, however, is more in keeping with that of the National Security Strategy, which describes building U.S. military forces strong enough "to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling the power of the United States."

The broad political purposes for the use of military power clearly encompass many different employment options for military force. These operations vary in size, purpose, and combat intensity in what the Joint Staff calls the "Range of Military Operations (ROMO)" that extends from military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence activities to crisis response and limited contingency operations and, if necessary, major operations and campaigns (Figure 
17-3
39
Peace operations can be considered as either peace enforcement or peacekeeping operations. Peace enforcement operations are also referred to as Chapter VII operations, referring to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which addresses enforcement actions "with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression." A closely related category is peacemaking, which assumes that one of the protagonists opposes the status quo. These operations take place in a non-consensual environment. Peacekeeping is often referred to as a Chapter VI operation under the UN Charter, which addresses "pacific settlement of disputes." Peacekeepers are impartial and relatively passive, called upon to monitor or verify troop withdrawals, separation of forces, or to provide security during elections. These operations take place in a consensual environment. Using military forces for military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence represent ongoing operations that shape the environment and maintain cooperative relations with other nations. In general these missions are below the threshold of armed conflict and are designed to build trust and confidence, develop partner capacity and, in the case of deterrence, to present a credible threat of counteraction.
In any event, all of these different classifications of military operations can be viewed as fulfilling one of the three principal political purposes: defensive, compellent or deterrent. For example, the political goal of humanitarian interventions and peacekeeping operations is to save lives; this is defense of parties under attack. The political goal of nation-assistance is to construct a viable government; this can be viewed as compelling armed groups or other elements of the society to obey the new central government. As a final example, the political goal of any collective security arrangement is to prevent aggression; which is deterrence.

War cannot be divorced from political life; whenever this occurs in our thinking about war, the many links that connect the two elements are destroyed and we are left with something pointless and devoid of sense.
If not in the interests of the state, do not act. If you cannot succeed, do not use troops.
Madeleine Albright asked me in frustration, "What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?" I thought I would have an aneurysm.
These quotations emphasize the importance of linking political objectives to the use of military force. One of the best ways to ensure this is to use military force only in support of the national interest and when success is assured. The difficulty with such a straightforward prescription is reconciling the various degrees of interests, to include valid concerns about furthering important national and international values. In addition, the resort to war or conflict always unleashes the forces of chance and friction-creating in one analyst's description, "a fearful lottery."

The second concern is that states often use force in support of secondary and even tertiary interests. They do this either to protect vital interests, or to support important national values. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry supported the selective use of force and thus distinguished between three categories of interests-vital, important, and humanitarian. He argued that different uses of limited force, and not necessarily applied in an overwhelming manner, were appropriate to protect these interests in the pursuit of limited objectives. 
57
58
59
There are two other points worth considering on this criterion. First, once a war begins, chance, friction, and uncertainty take effect and original political objectives and force requirements, as Michael Handel has observed, can change:
Weinberger's assumptions are more correct for military interventions/operations that can be carried out swiftly and decisively,…than they are for prolonged interventions and wars. The problem, of course, is that it is often very difficult to tell in advance which interventions will be short and decisive, and which will be costly and long. 
60
61
My view is that democratically elected and accountable individuals have been placed in positions where they can and must make decisions to defend our national security. The risk and burden of leadership is that those decisions will receive, or not receive, the support of the people on their merits. The democratic process will deal with leaders who fail to measure up to the standards imposed by the American people…. 
62
63
the inertia of the governed can not be disentangled from the indifference of the government. American leaders have both a circular and a deliberate relationship to public opinion. It is circular because their constituencies are rarely if ever aroused by foreign crises, even genocidal ones, in the absence of political leadership, and yet at the same time U.S. officials continually cite the absence of public support as grounds for inaction.

Michael Handel refers to the final item, the need for continuous reassessment, as the escape clause. Circumstances may change, or the enemy may respond in an unexpected manner, all necessitating a reassessment of objectives (ends), concepts (ways), and forces (means). That criterion also implies that if the costs become too high or if the objectives do not justify a greater commitment of resources, it may be prudent to terminate the conflict.

One of the main tenets of the Weinberger Doctrine was the need to garner public and congressional support-"some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress." 
76

Constitutional provisions represent the foundation of legitimacy in the United States. Under the Constitution, the President and Congress share the war powers. The President is commander in chief (Article II, Section 2), but Congress has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces (Article I, Section 8). Congress, however, has declared war only on five occasions, the last being World War II. Despite having considerable constitutional authority over decisions about the use of force, Congress has largely deferred to the President as commander in chief, in general recognition that this role makes him responsible for leading the armed forces and gives him the power to repel attacks against the United States. Consequently, the executive branch has executed most military interventions. 
79
80
Despite this record on reporting, a longer-term issue concerns the degree to which Congress is actually participating in the decisions to employ force. The WPR requires the President to consult with Congress prior to introducing U.S. forces into hostilities and to continue consultations as long as the armed forces remain. The conclusion of one Congressional Research study is that there has been very little executive consultation with Congress, "when consultation is defined to mean seeking advice prior to a decision to introduce troops." 81 It is certainly in the country's best interest to garner congressional support, and thus the two branches of government need to work out useful political processes that debate, inform, and support the country's engagement in conflict. From this perspective, a major purpose behind the WPR was not necessarily to constrain the President, but to force the Congress to meet its obligations to share in decisions on the use of force. This would compel members to face within a predictable period and under specified procedures the fundamental question regarding military action by the United States: Does the Congress endorse or oppose the commitment of American blood and treasure to a particular mission?"

The founding of the United Nations substantially narrowed the legitimacy of the use of force by individual nation-states. The UN Charter indicates in its Preamble that the UN is established "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war," and its substantive provisions obligate the member states to "settle their international disputes by peaceful means" (Article 2(3)) and to "refrain…from the threat of use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state…." (Article 2(4)). In place of the traditional right of states to resort to force, the charter creates a system of collective security in which the Security Council is authorized to "determine the existence of any threat to the peace" and to "decide what measures shall be taken…to maintain international peace and security" (Article 39). 
90
91
92
93
Based on the use of force in the last decade, some analysts have argued that the UN Security Council must be reformed: enlarged to become more representative, and restructured to replace the veto system. One rationale for the elimination of the veto power of the permanent five is based on the need for legitimacy:
All modern military operations need international legitimacy if they are going to succeed. Consequently, the great powers, especially America, face a difficult choice: they can either maintain the veto, and embark on unsanctioned military adventures with their partners only to see these fail because of lack of international approval; or they can surrender veto power in return for the increased likelihood of securing majority approval for the use of military power.

War between nation-states endures because human interests, values, and commitments are often irreconcilable. In addition, because of the existence of a much more insidious kind of violence-catastrophic terrorism-military power remains the ultimate defender of common human values, and the ultimate arbiter of human disagreements:
The efficacy of force endures. For in anarchy, force and politics are connected. By itself, military power guarantees neither survival nor prosperity. But it is almost always the essential ingredient for both. Because resort to force is the ultimate card of all states, the seriousness of a state's intentions is conveyed fundamentally by its having a credible military posture. Without it, a state's diplomacy generally lacks effectiveness.

Strategic campaign planners and statesmen often begin their analyses by assuming a linear cause-and-effect relationship, similar to a move-countermove exchange in chess. Although such linear formulations may sometimes be a useful starting point, they can also be disas trously misleading. Systems thinking, however, provides an alternative that compensates for the limits of linear reasoning in military design. This chapter considers the implications of systems thinking as a theory and applies the implications of systems complexity specifically to military operational design. The perspectives of Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian military theorist, inform current doctrine on design, and the Clausewitzian concept of center of gravity provides an essential tool for commanders to employ in designing campaigns.
For centuries, the basic approach of science relied on linear logic and a belief that the best method for understanding any phenomenon was to break that phenomenon into parts that could be studied independently. Doing so was thought to simplify a problem, thereby making it more manageable for the scientist. The approach assumed the whole was simply equal to the sum of its parts. The logic of this linear thinking and its associated mechanical metaphors transferred outside of the natural sciences and applied to many other disciplines.
Beginning in the 1950s, pioneers of the systems paradigm questioned whether this mechanistic approach was the best method for gaining knowledge of the natural and social worlds. Some of these theorists were concerned that the expansion of knowledge was so great that it resulted in exces sive specialization, which prevented scientists from communicating across disciplines, so that physicists, biologists, and sociologists were isolated from one another. The advocates of a systems approach wanted to create a general theory that could identify the existence of laws that might apply to similar structures in different fields. Underlying this emerging view was recognition that the whole was not merely the sum of its parts, but rather, something synergistically more. Consequently, a new approach organized around the concept of systems took root. Ludwig von Bertalanffy, one of systems theory's early proponents, saw the purpose of systems theory as "an important means in the process of developing new branches of knowledge into exact science, i.e., a system of mathematical laws." 1 Such a conception of systems theory implied a promise of greater certainty with increased ability to predict than the earlier mechanistic approach.
The dynamic behavior of closed systems is quite different from that of open systems in that the former allow greater certainty and prediction. Closed systems consist of limited variables and often impermeable boundaries between elements and so typically act in a predictable, mechanistic way. For example, a person knows what the response of a thermostat will be when one adjusts the temperature up or down. In contrast, a more open system, like a social-political system, does not respond to some stimulus, say, a stock market fluctuation, in a predictable pattern. The unpredictability of open systems stems in part from the fact that many more variables are at work than in closed systems, boundaries between elements are permeable, and linkages are often both tenuous and connected in unforeseeable ways. Ironically, initial systems thinking sought greater certainty and control to facilitate prediction and enhance interdisciplinary communication. However, when the concepts were applied to more open systems like organizations or societies, the expected outcomes did not materialize and instead resulted in both unanticipated and unintended consequences.
When thinking of an organization, one tends to look at its structure as a wiring diagram that depicts departments and functions in the form of a bureaucracy-hierarchical and well-defined. Military organizations in particular have long been considered illustrative of such structure and processes. Gareth Morgan conceptualized organizations as functioning like a machine. 
2
3
As one would expect, this machine metaphor, while potentially effective in a stable, predictable environment, had some drawbacks. The emergence of larger and more complex organizations led to the discipline of systems analysis and the rise of Operations Research and Systems Analysis (ORSA). ORSA practitioners sought to identify all key parameters of closed production systems by observation, measurement, and analysis. Analysts then developed mathematical models and simulations to determine the optimal design of systems and processes. This ORSA approach attained prominence in military circles with the "whiz kids" of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the 1960s. In the 1980s, the emphasis on systems analysis led to systems engineering, with the focus on design and control. 
4
The focus on the scientific reductionism of processes by managers resulted in them doing things right (that is, following established procedures) within well-defined structures. However, as the complexity of globalization and the interconnectivity of near-instantaneous communications and data processing increased, this approach proved less and less efficacious. Organization theorist and systems thinking pioneer Russell Ackoff presented another perspective of organizations as human enterprises with people as integral components, and organizations as part of open systems. 
5
Peter Senge introduced and captured in his book The Fifth Discipline the treatment of an organization as an entity that actually "learns." 
6
• Over 75 percent of re-engineering efforts fail to achieve targeted improvements in performance. • Many initiatives to reduce cost in one part of a system result in increased cost elsewhere.
• The vast majority of restructuring efforts fail to achieve intended synergies and generate unintended consequences. • Large-scale projects tend to overrun schedule, budget, or both.
• Metrics result in more reports and administrative burdens but shed little light on the levers that can be pulled to meet targets.
Senge offered a view of organizations as social activities that perform best when all members are able to contribute to achieving their goals. While some have called this empowerment, systems thinking is the critical competency in an organization that develops the synergy of the other four disciplines. 
7
Senge's insights apply to the Department of Defense (DoD) and its armed services, which are undeniably large, stratified organizations composed of systems within systems. A review of any DoD organizational chart will illustrate the functions and assignment of responsibilities to pro vide a product or service in the pursuit of national defense. The Army Organizational Life Cycle Model (AOLCM) depicts the linkage of systems for acquiring, developing, employing, and then retiring resources (see Figure 
18
The machine metaphor used to characterize organizational design is more troublesome when applied to open political and social systems. Thus, the impact of interactions, associated negative feedback, and unintended consequences is central to the security dilemma underlying dynamic processes in international relations. The dilemma stems from the fact that states often seek to maximize their power by increasing the resources devoted to their security. By doing so, states are able to threaten others who are likely to respond with efforts to neutralize or counterbalance the effort of the first state. The result is that no state is more secure than when the process began, and the first state was unable to maximize its power as intended. Similarly, the balance of power illustrates the negative feedback found in international politics. States may respond to threats by balancing against any state that might threaten their security, so that any move that could bring a state great competitive advantage can be expected to generate opposition from others. For example, one can look at the North Korean attack on South Korea in 1950 as reflecting such a response. That attack was sanctioned by both the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the assumption that the North Korean advance would strengthen their position in Northeast Asia against the United States and Japan. However, the attack had the opposite effect because it led the United States to triple its defense budget, conclude defense treaties around the globe, and transform the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into a functioning military command. 
9
What, then, are the aspects of a systems approach that are most helpful for military leaders in strategic thinking and design? Systems thinking applied to the kinds of open systems with which commanders and staff planners deal provides a caution against the hazards of simple linear cause-and-effect reasoning. A starting point for appreciating differences between systems thinking and linear thinking lies with the definition of system. A system is a set of units (or elements) interconnected in such a way that change in some elements produce changes in other parts of the system. In addition, the changes induced in other elements will not necessarily be proportional to the initial change. The aphorism, "the straw that broke the camel's back," nicely captures this disproportion between inputs and outcomes. Initially inputs and outcomes seem at balance. One straw, or even several straws, appear to cause the camel no discomfort. However, eventually the addition of a single straw, no different from the others, causes our unfortunate beast to crumble-a seemingly disproportionate outcome, given our earlier experience with camel loading. Similarly, in the realm of economics, the "law of diminishing returns" suggests that at a particular inflec tion point returns will decrease despite increased input, again demonstrating an example of the disproportion between inputs and outcomes. In addition, the system as a whole exhibits properties or behaviors different from its individual parts. Following from the definition of system, interactions and interconnections within and outside the system must affect strategic thinkers contemplating military design.
Any theater of war presents a complex array of intermixed physical, geographical, psychological, social, political, and economic factors such that experts have long recognized that military operations must be approached from a systems perspective. 
10
11
Historically, military operations are among the most complex of human activities. They take place in and across a range of decisive actions, yet this contin uum is prone to overlap, indistinct transitions, varying magnitudes, and contemporaneous actions. 
12
13
14
Accordingly, an operational or strategic commander cannot focus on purely military matters in his operational environment and ignore other subsystem or related system elements. Certainly potential adversaries realize this, as it is clear that U.S. military power is overwhelming. If an enemy cannot hope to prevail militar ily, that foe is likely to choose other battlespace. Instead of a military-to-military confrontation, modern warfare is likely to require the application of all elements of national power (diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) against adversary systems (political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructure). 
15
The great Prussian theorist of war, Carl von Clausewitz, posited two ways out of systems-generated conundrums. The first was to recognize that just as all things in war are complex and cause friction, not all things are of equal impor tance or equal difficulty. Tactical tasks are relatively selfcontained, and logistical concerns are restricted along certain channels of action by the limitations of time and space. However, as the functions to be performed become increasingly intellectual, the more the commander's cognition and experience becomes of paramount importance. 
16
17
18
Design as a creative thinking methodology is not new, but rather reemphasizes an approach to systems thinking that postulates that the commander must appreciate the operational environment facing him/her and must further be able to assess the relative qualities and values of systemic operational factors. Only by thus framing the nature of the problems confronting the organization can a commander visualize a concept of operations and describe to others a mission narrative about how to effectively bring about change. 
19
20
21
22
If we pursue the demands that war makes upon those who practice it, we come to a region dominated by the powers of intellect. War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth. 
23
In the joint doctrinal context, design is directly applicable to operational art. Design in volves the formation and use of a conceptual and contextual framework as the foundation for understanding the situation and the problem relative to implementing strategic direction. Design reduces system complexity and ambiguity to enable cam paign planning, joint operations order development, and subsequent execution of the campaign. 
24
However, it is the nature of complicated systems to defy rational analysis and linear thought. As Clausewitz pointed out, there is no quick and easy process that will eliminate friction and dissipate the fog, enabling the commander to crystallize an appropriate course of action in an operational environment comprised of numerous in terrelated subsystems. The resultant systems interaction of complexity, indistinctness, internal dynamics, and human cognitive limitations place heavy demands on planners and make the commander's decisionmaking imprecise and riskprone. 
25
26
The Clausewitzian concept of center of gravity is a useful construct in design. It provides a means by which commanders and planners can frame the complicated interlocking systems making up the operational environment, set priorities, and coordinate and synchronize efforts across the range of warfighting functions. Clausewitz described this concept thusly:
One must keep the dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind. Out of these characteristics a certain center of gravity develops, the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends. That is the point against which all our energies should be directed. Small things always depend on great ones, unimportant on important, accidentals on essentials. This must guide our approach. . . . [Only] by constantly seeking out the center of his power, by daring all to win all, will one really defeat the enemy.

The story is told of two Pentagon strategists who decided to relax one weekend by going for a flight in a hot air balloon. After traveling above the clouds for a time, they realized they had lost their bearings. Dropping below the clouds, they found themselves over an open field and spotted a man hiking nearby. They drew close enough for him to hear and called out, "Can you tell us where we are?"
The man looked at them blankly for a moment, then responded, "You're in a hot air balloon."
One strategist looked at the other and muttered, "Just our luck-we had to find an intelligence analyst."
The other asked, "How did you know he was an intelligence analyst?"
The first strategist replied, "Because his answer was prompt, accurate, and of no use whatsoever!" Unfortunately, while the anecdote may be apocryphal, the sentiment is all too common. Many strategists fault the intelligence community for failing to provide information and analysis relevant to the issues with which they are dealing. Why does this situation exist, and what can be done to improve it?
The failure of intelligence to support strategy properly stems from several sources. For various reasons, intelligence analysts may not have insight on the challenges faced by or the perspective of the strategists. The information delivered may have limited relevance to the actual problems confronting those developing or implementing the strategy. At times, the information may be relevant and timely, but the strategists may deem it unconvincing or unhelpful. If the strategists are unfamiliar with the limitations and capabilities of intelligence, they may not understand how to interpret the information provided.
While there is no perfect solution to these challenges, if the intelligence analyst becomes part of the strategy team, the information he provides will be more relevant to the problems under consideration, and the strategists will better understand how to use what has been given to them. The question then becomes, how is intelligence-and the intelligence analyst-best integrated into the strategy team?
One of the challenges in discussing the role of intelligence in strategy formulation is finding a useful definition of the term "intelligence." How is it different from information? Like many other basic terms associated with national security, definitions of intelligence abound, shaped by the experience or perspective of the individual giving the definition.
No less an authority than Sherman Kent-considered by many as the father of strategic intelligence in America -pointed out that intelligence is simultaneously knowledge, an activity, and an organization. 
1
2
Vernon Walters, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, offered a slightly more detailed definition of intelligence. "Intelligence is information, not always available in the public domain, relating to the strength, resources, capabilities, and intentions of a foreign country that can affect our lives and the safety of our people." 
3
Perhaps the CIA's journal Studies in Intelligence offered the best definition in 1958 when a CIA operations officer using the pseudonym R.A. Random proposed the following:
Intelligence is the official, secret collection and processing of information on foreign countries to aid in formulating and implementing foreign policy, and the conduct of covert activities abroad to facilitate the implementation of foreign policy. 
4
This last definition also addresses the use of covert activities in support of foreign policy, bringing forward the concept that intelligence is more than an informer of strategy. It may also serve as a means for carrying out a strategy. Both these roles of intelligence-as an source of information used in the development of strategies and as a tool to be used in implementing those strategieswork best if intelligence is fully integrated in the strategy team.
Intelligence is first and foremost an enabler of strategy. It not only provides a baseline of information on which to build plans, but also projects potential reactions by others-both adversaries and neutrals-to those plans, helping strategists evaluate the feasibility of proposed courses of action. Additionally, since strategy is by definition proactive, intelligence helps strategists identify both opportunities and threats to national security so they can develop appropriate plans.
This concept of intelligence as a predictive enabler of strategy is hardly new. The ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu saw intelligence as a fundamental tool of the strategist, stating, "Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril." 5 Speaking specifically about the use of espionage, Sun Tzu opined, "Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy…is foreknowledge." 
6
7
Of course, others see intelligence more from the perspective of our two balloonists. Carl von Clausewitz viewed intelligence as an impediment to sound strategy-unreliable, contradictory, often false, and usually uncertain. In On War, he stated that the "difficulty of accurate recognition constitutes one of the most serious sources of friction in war."(Italics in the original). 
8
Part of the mission of the strategist is to use intelligence in such a way that it serves as an aid and not a hindrance to the development of sound plans. The best way to achieve this is by integrating the intelligence function in the strategy team.
There are generally two schools of thought on the proper relationship between strategists and intelligence officers. The "distance" school holds that in order to avoid tainting the analytic process, intelligence analysts should be kept separate from the policy/strategy community. The "proximity" school believes that close coordination between analysts and strategists is necessary to ensure the assessments are relevant to the questions at hand.
Traditionally, the U.S. Intelligence Community has preferred to maintain the separation of intelligence from policy/strategy development, answering questions when requested by the strategy community and providing alerts to opportunities and threats whenever they are detected. By maintaining their distance, the thinking goes, analysts are sheltered from undue pressure and can form their assessments independently. Analysis that is uncorrupted by outside influences best serves strategists.
Unfortunately, while this philosophy may protect the objectivity of the intelligence community, Sherman Kent highlights the inherent problem. He stated that when strategists are "formulating something new in our foreign policy they often come to intelligence and ask for background. (They should do this more than they actually do.)" 
9
The alternative view is to integrate the analysts in the strategy team-what former CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence John McLaughlin termed "bridging the divide." McLaughlin and others suggest analysts should be embedded within policy shops and planning staffs to understand not only their immediate intelligence requirements, but also how the strategists view and use intelligence in their work. Without this insight, the intelligence analysts may write products without any clear connection to the needs or perspectives of the consumers, with the result that it is often off the mark or, worse yet, appears uninformed. 
10
Integrating intelligence analysts in the strategy team does entail some risks. While analysts should seek to influence strategy deliberations by providing relevant information on the issues at hand, they cannot advocate for a policy. Analysts may offer informed opinions if asked, but generally need to restrict themselves to the identification of opportunities or estimates of likely reactions to a proposed course of action. If intelligence analysts begin to support a particular policy option, their assessments may become biased, depriving their work of the objectivity that is at the heart of intelligence analysis. They may fall victim to confirmation bias, seeking out data that conforms to their preconceived ideas and ignoring information that does not match the preferred policy option. While these risks exist even when the analysts are not integrated in the strategy team, the potential for analytic bias increases when the intelligence officers are involved in policy discussions.
The relationship between analysts and strategists is not reciprocal. While analysts cannot advocate for a specific policy, strategists may always form their own judgments on the intelligence provided them. Mark Lowenthal, former Assistant Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) for Analysis, likened the relationship between analysts and policymakers to a semipermeable membrane that allows flow in one direction but not the other; analysts cannot recommend policy, but policymakers may always be their own intelligence analysts. 
11
Integrating intelligence analysts in the strategy team takes time; because intelligence analysis is a subjective art, not a precise science, the strategist has to develop a sense of trust in the judgment of the analyst. Conversely, the analyst needs to develop a sense of how to best provide information to the strategists-what formats and approaches are most useful or persuasive for the individuals being supported. A good place to start building a relationship is for the strategist to establish the level and area of expertise of the analyst. If the strategist is going to place any reliance on the judgment of the analyst, the strategist must be comfortable that the analyst has sufficient background and training to render useful and reliable assessments.
Intelligence analysts embody two separate kinds of expertise-topical and tradecraft. Topical expertise comes from the study of a particular issue or region. Analysts may derive their topical expertise from formal schooling, life experiences, or a combination of both. Topical expertise provides the analyst with the background and knowledge needed to assess the substance of an issue under investigation. Expertise in tradecraft generally comes from experience and some analytic training courses. It provides the analyst with the tools to be able to gather the right kinds of information, critically assess sources and data, and provide well-grounded and properly qualified judgments. Good tradecraft aids analysts in clarifying assumptions and properly couching levels of uncertainty. Analysts need to possess both types of expertise to provide insightful and wellsupported estimates and projections to the strategy team.
As with any profession, intelligence analysts have greatly varying levels and areas of expertise. Some have a narrow focus and deep knowledge on a particular subject, while others will have held multiple assignments on widely varying topics-building their tradecraft but lacking depth in any one area. Only in the rarest of instances will the strategy team find the analyst assigned to assist them has precisely the expertise needed to help them delve into the exact problem with which they are wrestling. However, the analyst is able to tap into the knowledge and experience of other analysts in the greater intelligence community.
Most commonly, the analyst will research and bring in relevant finished intelligence reports that address a question at hand. The analyst can also send out ad hoc questions to solicit the views from experts around the intelligence community. Collection requirements can be developed to fill identified information gaps. The analyst can arrange for intelligence experts to brief the team or work with them on a particular problem. The intelligence officers assigned to the team serve as much as a liaison to the greater intelligence community as they do as intelligence experts in their own right.
Rarely will an intelligence organization or a military command have the luxury of being able to assign an analyst full-time to a strategy team. In almost all instances analysts will work with the strategy team on a part-time basis, having other responsibilities to fulfill as briefers, writers, managers, and so forth. Both analysts and the strategy team must be committed to the relationship or it will become overwhelmed by other priorities. Strategic leaders must insist on the full participation of intelligence in the strategy formulation process. Better participation can be fostered, for example, by requiring an analyst's review of any policy recommendations to ensure the operational environment properly reflects the intelligence information available. Similarly, by having regularly scheduled sessions to discuss the status of projects and problems the team is facing, analysts can offer relevant information in a timely manner or can develop new collection requirements to fill intelligence gaps identified by the team.
When outside analysts are brought in to brief the strategy team or provide expert assistance on an issue under consideration, the strategist should establish the bona fides of the analysts in much the same way and for the same reasons as discussed for the embedded analyst. Knowing the background and depth of experience of the analysts will help the strategists understand exactly how much weight they should place in the judgments of the intelligence analyst. Are the analysts offering first-hand judgments based on their own expertise, or is their assessment based more on their interaction with other experts and finished analysis done elsewhere? This sort of critical weighing of the analyst is especially important when the nature of the exchange is more ad hoc and interactive. When an analyst has to provide judgments "on the fly," rather than rely on prepared products, the strategist needs to be comfortable with the analyst's background. In the end, the strategist must believe he or she can use the judgments of the analyst as a basis for developing strategies. Therefore, trust and confidence are crucial.
This development of trust becomes all the more critical when the analysts are providing information or estimates that do not conform to the conventional wisdom or otherwise are contrary to the preferences or preconceived ideas of the strategists. In such cases, even a well-grounded and soundly reasoned analysis may not be persuasive. The willingness of the strategists to accept contrary or inconvenient analyses will rely at least as much on their assessment of the credibility of the analyst as it will on the analysis itself. Henry Kissinger is reported to have once said with regard to an intelligence warning, "You warned me-but you didn't convince me."

By definition, strategy deals with the future. Unfortunately, no amount of art or effort can pierce the veil of time and provide a clear vision of the future. This does not mean that strategists cannot know anything about the future-but they must deal with assumptions about how that future is likely to play out. And since the entire purpose of strategy is to influence the future, the activities of the strategist will affect and alter that outcome. The job of the strategist-and the particular role of intelligence in the development of strategy-is to assess the outlines of the uncertainty and develop plans to deal with it. As Colin Gray put it, "The challenge is to cope with uncertainty, not try to diminish it." 
13

Obviously, the best intelligence is to have insight into the plans of adversaries, allies, and other actors in the system, but this is both rare and unreliable. It is rare because other groups protect their plans carefully. It is unreliable because plans do not tell what will happen, only what another actor intends to do. Just as the strategist's plans don't survive contact with reality, neither do the enemy's. Competition for resources, fog, friction, and incompetence all affect reality. Implementation of a strategy affects the strategic environment, causing the adversary to react, often in ways he had not previously planned. But plans can give insight into the objectives, concerns, vulnerabilities, and mindset of key actors. They can shed light on opportunities that the strategists can exploit.
Effective strategies must take into account a wide range of possibilities, addressing the most likely future while providing the flexibility to adapt to unexpected changes or trends. Intelligence can help provide earlier warning that the future is veering off from the anticipated path.
Strategy is about balancing ends, ways, and means and assessing the risks involved in a proposed course of action. Therefore, strategists must acknowledge the vulnerabilities of a recommended approach. Strategists should ask the intelligence analysts, "What would I expect to see if the opponent were going to attack my vulnerability? Is there any evidence to suggest the adversary is taking this course?" Intellectual engagement early in the strategy formulation process allows the intelligence analyst to develop collection requirements to reveal if the adversary is taking steps that would hamper or counter the intended course of action. Although by no mean infallible, proactive planning of intelligence collection can provide early warning that the strategy may need adjustment to account for the adversary's reactions.
High-impact, low-probability events are one of the most difficult areas for strategists to take into account. No country has the resources to prepare completely for every possible event that, though unlikely, could have devastating impact on a society. 
15
Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz used the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as an example of the role of intelligence in anticipating low-probability/high-impact events. While the conventional wisdom held that Saddam Hussein would not make any moves toward his neighbors in the late 1980s, the intelligence community did provide data documenting Saddam's aggressive tendencies. Wolfowitz did not fault intelligence for failing to predict the invasion when Iraq first moved troops to the Kuwaiti border-Saddam had not yet made the decision to invade-but argued that too little attention was paid to what might have been done to deter Hussein from acting aggressively. He stated, "Analysis, in this instance, would have usefully pointed to the fact that events were not going in the direction we had expected or hoped for." 
16
Good use of intelligence while developing, implementing, and adjusting strategies can be the difference between having an effective plan and being strategically surprised. As Gray noted, strategist must cope with uncertainty. Intelligence cannot eliminate surprise or risk, but can certainly reduce both.
Even if the intelligence analysts are fully integrated in the strategy team, understanding and focusing on the specific goals and information requirements of the team, not every intelligence product will automatically fulfill the needs of the policymaker. However, there are three key questions that the strategist can ask of intelligence that will increase the relevance of the information provided.
Many intelligence analysts deal primarily in tactical, current, or basic intelligence. This is the realm of concrete data-orders of battle, economic reports, current events reporting. The focus is on facts-who, what, where, when. While this information is important-even vital-for strategists, it is only a starting point. This type of information forms part of the library from which strategists can draw data for planning. And because most strategists have risen from the ranks of tactical operators, it is this type of information with which they are most familiar and comfortable.
However, strategists require far more from intelligence than just the facts. Intelligence analysis should provide a strategic context-a sense of how the information or events being reported fit into the bigger picture. Ideally, every analytic intelligence product would include this sense of "so what?" However, we do not live in an ideal world; many intelligence products provide the facts of a matter, but fail to put them in context. The strategic consumer of intelligence must often ask the all-too obvious question, "Why do I care? What does it mean?"
If the intelligence analysts are excluded from the strategy team, such a question is usually muttered in an office, the intelligence is set aside as irrelevant, and the process does not improve. The strategists either assume the intelligence community cannot provide the context for the analysis or they do not know to whom the question should be directed. However, if intelligence is fully integrated in the strategy process, the strategist can ask these questions directly to the analysts. Occasionally, the intelligence officer may have the answer at hand; more often, if he or she is not the author or expert on the topic, they may have to go back to the originator to get further background.
The response to this question will not only better inform the strategist on the relevance of the information, but will also shed light on the limitations of the data. In some cases, the analysts know about an activity and report on it factually, but they may be unsure of its import or intent. They know something is going on, but not what it really means. The fact that the intelligence analysts don't know the import of an event may be sufficient for the strategist to take this unknown into account.
Ideally, strategists need a glimpse into the future. Strategy is much simpler when one knows for sure what will happen. Unfortunately, certainty of events is the realm of history, not strategy (and most historians would argue that point.) Intelligence deals in the world of estimates and projections, not predictions. Predictions describe what will happen. There is an element of inevitability or certainty in predictions. The intelligence community is not in the business of providing predictions.
Obviously, the future is never truly predictable. Not only is the human mind incapable of unfailing foresight, but the very nature of strategy affects the future, making accurate predictions impossible. Strategy is anticipatory. By carrying out a strategy, a nation will impact the course of events, changing what might have been into what that country hopes is a more beneficial future. This is the whole point of having a strategy. Similarly, the other actors in a strategic system interact with the system, either carrying out their own strategies or reacting to the strategies of others. Every action changes the environment. It is in this uncertain and, to a degree, unpredictable realm that intelligence can shed some light to guide the development of strategy.
Estimates describe the intelligence community's best understanding of what is happening and where such trends will most likely lead. Projections are the futuristic element of estimates; they deal with likely scenarios and the factors that make a particular outcome most probable. Projections are the extrapolation of existing trends and their interrelationships, leading to an estimate of a future situation.
Understanding the distinction between predictions and projections is critical if strategists are to make proper use of intelligence. Expecting too much from estimates results in frustration. Misunderstanding the limitations of projections can lead to flawed strategies, based on a belief the future is more certain than it really is. Appreciating the uncertainty in a projection helps the strategist assess the risk in a proposed course of action. The most common mistake, however, is for the strategist not to understand what data led to an assessment. By knowing the assumptions and key trends underpinning a projection, strategists gain insight into warning signs that suggest the future is no longer following the projected track. Even more importantly, knowing the key influences and trends helps strategists identify individuals, groups, or issues that are critical nodes or vulnerabilities for either changing or sustaining the strategic situation.
Projections cannot predict the future, but they can reduce the risk of strategic surprise. While an adversary can frequently achieve tactical surprise, the efforts required for strategic shifts are more difficult to hide. While the attack on Pearl Harbor came as a shock to the United States (a tactical surprise), there were ample signs-understood by many in Washington-that relations with Japan were approaching a breaking point (strategic warning). For strategists, intelligence projections aid in thinking through possible courses of action and their potential impact on the underlying trends driving those projections.
By far the most controversial question a strategist can ask of intelligence is, "What can I do about this situation?" If properly engaged, intelligence analysts can provide insights into centers of gravity and potential opportunities that a sound strategy must consider. However, opportunity analysis can easily cross the line into actually advocating a policy option. Exactly where this line lies and how to provide proper policy support is at the heart of the debate over whether to integrate intelligence analysts in the strategy team.
Intelligence can identify vulnerabilities, political agendas, or internal fissures in a foreign government that the strategist can use to further strategic ends. Knowing which ministers have the ear of a head of state can be the key to successful negotiations. Understanding what an adversary most values or fears can shape informational, diplomatic, or military aims. Assessments of this type are termed opportunity analysis-an identification of areas in which the system of interest is open to change. Good opportunity analysis can reveal to the strategist avenues of approach not previously considered. 
17
Intelligence becomes politicized when the assessments are no longer objectively reached, but rather are predetermined or biased to reach a specific judgment. Analysts may begin to deliberately slant their judgments to support the party line, either because they have bought into the perspective of the strategists or out of a desire to be seen as a team player. Some analysts may believe that they will be excluded from discussions over options if they bring in unwelcome analysis. Somewhat less extreme but more likely, the analysts may subconsciously begin seeking data that supports the preferred judgment-a practice labeled as confirmation bias or cherry-picking. While these risks are real, they can be mitigated through proper analytic tradecraft-and by the strategists establishing a proper relationship, neither asking too much, nor too little, of opportunity analysis.
Striking the proper balance between politicizing intelligence or irrelevance is a delicate matter. 
18
Ultimately, it is incumbent on both strategists and intelligence analysts to maintain an appropriate relationship-close enough for the analysts to understand the information requirements of the strategists and provide timely, relevant analysis, yet distant enough to avoid losing objectivity. Analysts should neither advocate specific strategies, nor should they feel compelled to provide data to support the preferences of the strategists. Good intelligence estimates should help the strategist think through choices without attempting to recommend a particular course of action. The difference between opportunity identification and the politicization of intelligence is not a fine, clear line. It is a gray zone in which professionals-both analysts and strategists-must operate. The intelligence analyst should be viewed as a resource and advisor to the strategy team, almost as a consultant-valued but not part of the decisionmaking team. As John McLaughlin put it, intelligence needs to be "timely, digestible, and informed about the policy context while stopping short of pandering to or prescribing the policy." 
19
Access to intelligence analysts does not remove the requirement for strategists to use good, critical thinking throughout the strategy-formulation process. As Powell's three questions illustrate, analysts need to be challenged for the basis of their judgments. It is not sufficient for an analyst to have a view on the likely reaction of an adversary to a proposed course of action; the analyst owes the strategist the factual basis for this judgment. How sure is the information? Are there alternative views?
The breadth of the United States intelligence community is both a blessing and a curse for strategists. On the positive side, the strategist can potentially solicit and receive multiple perspectives on a key issue. Particularly in the political-military sphere, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), and possibly the regional Joint Intelligence Operations Center may all have views on the matter. Various centers may have differing assessments of a situation. In the past, one agency might have access to privileged information not shared with other groups, though after September 11 th this problem has been significantly reduced. Based on the institutional biases of the organization or the experiences and preferences of the leading analysts, two organizations using the same data can still arrive at very different conclusions. This diversity of perspectives can guard the strategist 
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell also had three questions that he used during his military career to probe the intelligence given to him. These questions deal with critical thinking, separating facts from assumptions and giving the strategist a firmer base of information on which to build a strategy. Powell What do you know? This deceivingly simple question can often uncover assumptions and leaps of logic. Embedded in this question is the corollary-how do you know it? What are your sources? Are they reliable? At the heart of the Iraqi WMD controversy was reliance on limited sources of questionable reliability. Based on the Silberman-Robb (WMD) Commission report, the Director of National Intelligence established standards to improve the documentation of sources, giving analysts-especially those who are incorporating finished intelligence from other analysts or agencies-better insight into the original sources of information. Probing carefully on the facts-not judgments -behind intelligence analysis is a critical strategic leader skill.
What do you not know? Strategists have to deal with a world of uncertainty. Good intelligence can narrow the information gaps, thereby reducing uncertainty. However, all too often strategists fail to inquire into the gaps in the intelligence. Unsurprisingly, intelligence analysts often do not offer up this information without being asked, especially if the communications are in writing. Not infrequently, analysts may not even have systematically thought through what critical information is missing. In some cases, analysts have inserted an assumption, but regarded it as a fact. Often adversary intentions and interests-critical assumptions-become regarded as facts, unquestioned by both analysts and strategists.
Clearly identifying the gaps in the intelligence allows the strategists to systematically think through the implications of the gaps. At a minimum, a strategy has to acknowledge risk when using an assumption in place of a fact. In some cases, the strategy will need to be broadened to account for the potentiality that events will unfold very differently than forecast due to critical gaps in the intelligence. Explicitly identifying gaps reduces-though it can never eliminate-the probability of surprise. Knowing what you do not know allows the strategist to place bounds on the likely outcomes and build strategies that accommodate this uncertainty.
What do you think? Secretary Powell's third question underlies the first two questions posed. The heart of intelligence is analysis. While collection of data is crucial, until that information is sifted through, organized, assessed, and analyzed, it is of limited use to the strategists. Intelligence analysts are more than reporters; their assessments of the data-its significance, salience, opportunities, threats, and validity-are important inputs for strategists. While some level of assessment should be integral to any good intelligence product, regular dialogue between the strategists and the intelligence analysts will usually yield far better results, as the analysts become against being blindsided. Independent analysis from multiple agencies helps avoid the trap of group-think, although analytic coordination across the intelligence community still makes false consensus possible. On the negative side, the diversity of views may leave the strategist no way to reconcile multiple analyses. The analysts assigned to the strategy team can help the strategists understand the basis for the differing views, although the analysts may have strong biases toward one particular assessment. Even if the analyst's position is supportive of the preferred strategic option, to avoid being surprised, the strategist should ask for alternative views from other agencies.
When developing a course of action that relies heavily on an intelligence judgment, strategists should inquire what information might change the overall judgment. Often a critical analytic judgment is based on an assumption or marginal data. In the absence of hard information, analysts must make some assumptions in order to provide projections or assessments. By probing for the most critical assumptions, the strategists can gauge how much uncertainty their courses of action must take into account. For example, in 1990, while analysts could see Iraqi forces massing on the border of Kuwait, there was a presumption that this was a show of force. For a number of good reasons, they did not believe Saddam Hussein would risk a major conflict by actually invading. 
21
While intelligence is most commonly thought of as an enabler of strategy, it also can serve as an instrument of strategy. The National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism cited intelligence along with financial and legal instruments as tools of national power, alongside the more commonly listed diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power. Although this expanded list of elements of power has not gained broad acceptance, intelligence has long been a tool used to attain strategic ends. While space limitations preclude a complete discussion on the ways and means of intelligence as a tool for executing a strategy, some key considerations on the strategic use of intelligence are covered below.
While the War on Terror has highlighted the importance of intelligence sharing between countries, the United States has had foreign liaison arrangements since at least the early-20th century. 
22
The strategist can use sharing of intelligence as a tool to forge closer relationships between the United States and other nations. The kind and utility of the information provided may signal a level of trust and confidence in the partner, fostering cooperation in other spheres. Bilateral agreements are most commonly used for intelligence sharing. Multilateral agreements, whether through established organizations such as NATO or ad hoc coalitions, provide broader access to the information provided, with attendant greater counterintelligence concerns. In many situations, intelligence-sharing arrangements can become a blend of multilateral and bilateral arrangements. In such scenarios, there is a significant risk of some partners balking when they discover or at least suspect that they are not receiving the same information as another coalition partner. Strategists must think through ahead of time how to handle the disparities in intelligence-sharing arrangements.
As with every strategic tool, there are risks and potential liabilities associated with sharing intelligence. Since good intelligence relies on the secrecy of both the data and the methods used to collect it, sharing information risks exposing methods and losing sources. The standards for internally sharing and protecting information vary widely between nations, and we must often establish special procedures to protect American interests. The counterintelligence risk may be higher in other countries. Third countries may deliberately target American information provided to a partner nation. If the third country is a traditional ally of the partner nation, the counterintelligence risk can be very high indeed.
The inverse of the counterintelligence risk to information provided to a partner are the risks involved in the intelligence provided by a partner. Without direct access to the sources of information-something that most intelligence services are loath to give-the American intelligence community has limited ability to validate the information provided. The partner service may unwittingly pass on fabricated information. Alternatively, the partner may provide informationpossibly fabricated, but usually true-whose primary purpose is more to influence U.S. perceptions and evaluations than to inform. And there is always a risk of circular reporting; multiple reports coming from several different sources that, if traced back through the reporting chain, actually originate from a single source. Such circular reporting can mislead intelligence analysts into placing greater credence in a report than the actual sourcing warrants.
Intelligence cooperation is often asymmetric in the sense that nations have different capabilities, and their capabilities bound what they can provide in a cooperative context. Given differing strengths and weaknesses, the United States might offer technical assistance or intelligence training in return for access to information the partner country collects and analyzes. Allies may also represent resources for translation of dialects in which the American intelligence community lacks translators. Foreign governments may even be willing to undertake some intelligence operations in coordination with or on behalf of the United States.
One reason intelligence often is not seen as an instrument of national power in its own right is because the distinction between the intelligence tool and the informational element of national power is at best unclear and in many regards artificial. Intelligence is information-albeit government-gathered, secret information. Some aspects of the employment of intelligence information are identical to the uses of other information sources. We leave to other authors the proper use of information in diplomatic, influence, or psychological operations; however, a few unique aspects of intelligence as information are worth covering here.
First, as noted earlier, intelligence sharing can be used to convey a message of trust and confidence to other nations. Which information is provided to which allies on what topics constitutes a strategic communications decision that ought be integrated with the overall engagement strategy.
Governments can also use the public disclosure of intelligence assessments to shape domestic and international opinion in support of a strategic objective. The administration of Tony Blair in Great Britain, for example, published a 55-page intelligence report on Iraqi WMD as part of a campaign to bolster support for its efforts to put pressure on the Saddam regime. 
23
The use of intelligence in the public arena is a tool that strategists must use sparingly and judiciously. Every public disclosure, even if unclassified, provides adversaries with a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of U.S. intelligence capabilities. Also, if an intelligence assessment is being specifically crafted for public release, there potentially will be greater pressure placed on the analysts to make the estimates support the desired policy. Individual phrases will be carefully scrutinized not just by the intelligence leaders, but by the policy community. The risk of politicization of the intelligence rises quickly when the assessments become part of the public debate on a strategy. While this risk can be managed through good tradecraft, strategists must carefully monitor themselves to ensure they do not become part of the problem.
Thanks to the voluminous information publicly available on intelligence methods-and even more, perhaps due to Hollywood's portrayal of intelligence capabilities-many adversaries and intelligence targets have views on the threats and risks U.S. intelligence poses to their operations. Adroit disclosure of intelligence priorities and capabilities-including perhaps misinformationcan be used to constrain an adversary. If a terrorist network, for example, believes any use of the Internet can be monitored, then one communication channel may be closed to them, complicating operational planning. The decision to disclose such information needs to be carefully weighed, since a capability, once revealed, is generally lost forever. As a rule, any decision to disclose intelligence capabilities rests with the Director of National Intelligence. Like every tool of strategy, the strategist must find the best possible balance between risks and gains.
The topic of covert action is far too diverse and complex to attempt to cover here. Suffice to say that strategists need to be aware of the strengths and limitations of this particular use of intelligence services as part an overall strategy. Covert operations were used very successfully in the Cold War to support friendly governments and fend off Communist influences.
By definition, covert operations mask the involvement of the U.S. government in the activity. However, in a democracy it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep government involvement hidden. While an activity may still provide plausible deniability, the role of the government in an action may become an accepted fact, shaping both domestic and international views on the strategy. When considering covert action, the strategist must take into account the implications to the overall strategy when, not if, the covert action becomes public knowledge.
Strategists deal with the future-a future that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. The purpose of strategy is to influence that future to serve one's national interests better. Intelligence cannot remove all the uncertainty, but can provide a solid grounding in the present and bound the likely directions of future events.
Good intelligence is vital for defining the strategic environment. Intelligence can identify opportunities and estimate the likely reactions and outcomes of different approaches. The strategist must combine these insights with other considerations of resources (means) and methods (ways) in the specific strategic context to find the best possible balance of risks to achieve the desired ends. Intelligence will not tell the strategist what to do, but, if used properly, it can illuminate the issues and aid in finding the best path.
These benefits, however, are unlikely to accrue if the intelligence analysts are kept out of the strategy-development process. If strategists ask questions for which the analysts do not know the context, the answers they get will often be like those provided to our balloonists. After receiving a few irrelevant or unhelpful responses, most strategists will stop engaging with the intelligence analysts at all. But if the analysts work regularly with the strategists, understand their needs and perspectives, and provide regular inputs to the policy deliberations, they can provide timely and insightful information-resulting in better-informed, and hopefully more successful, strategic decisions.
THEORY AND HISTORY
As we evaluate any military instrument, we must ask ourselves, "How can it contribute to the achievement of a political aim, either in peacetime or in war?" What leverage does the instrument offer those who employ it? What are its primary strengths? Primary limitations? How does it interact with other instruments of power, both military and nonmilitary? Can it be used independently? What are the advantages and risks of doing so?
This chapter will combine a basic historical narrative with excerpts from primary source literature, the latter articulating the views of some of the most prominent air power theorists in order to encourage thinking about the questions listed above. The role that airplanes should play in war (and which service should own them) developed into one of the most contentious and sustained military debates of the 20th century. Echoes of the struggle still exist, although the movement toward jointness has had a moderating effect. As you read, ask yourselves why the different theorists held particular views. What influenced their thinking? (Technology, culture, bureaucratic contests for resources?) What underlying assumptions did they make? How did these assumptions hold up in the test of actual warfare?
The idea of aerial warfare long predated the physical manifestation of airplanes. For centuries before the Wright brothers' first flight, humans had tried to imagine all the future roles that "aircraft" might play-not the least in war. Prior to World War I, the use of aircraft in war was very limited, and planning in this new realm was necessarily speculative. During World War I, aircraft underwent a revolutionary transformation, driven by the intensely competitive demands of the war. In 1914, warplanes were primitive machines held together by wire and twine. By 1918, large, sophisticated four-engine bombers had been developed and used. The arrival of these new instruments had major institutional and organizational ramifications for all modern military services.
The prewar expectations of individual observers tended to influence their interpretations of wartime experience. Since the interpretation of data and evidence is heavily conditioned by what people expect to see, their observations-rather than being wholly objective-are colored by social, cultural, and political influences, by their life experiences, and by the bureaucratic positions they hold.
Prior to the outbreak of World War I, civilian writers generally held higher expectations for air warfare than military planners did. The latter were more conservative, expecting an airplane's main contribution to be in improved reconnaissance. But a minority-officers who came to hold formative roles in the development of air power and thus came to hold an institutional stake in the future of air warfare-emerged from the war with strong convictions and bold claims about the revolutionary impact of the airplane on war.
During World War I, airplanes had proved their worth in a variety of realms. Indeed, nearly every modern mission of aircraft (as developed through the 20th century) received at least a rudimentary trial between 1914 and 1918. As many had expected, airplanes proved to be extraordinary reconnaissance tools, revolutionizing the way that intelligence would be gathered and battle space would be monitored. Indeed, the obvious value of air space created an instant need for instru-ments that could both seek it out (over enemy territory) and preserve it (over one's own territory). This led directly to the rise of fighter aircraft-and to their rapid, ongoing modification during the course of the war.
The relatively primitive state of communications technology in 1914 meant that air-ground and air-air contact was limited, but it improved generally over the course of the war and enhanced the battlefield role of the airplane. The tactics for the employment of aircraft were worked out just as ground combat tactics were worked out: through intensive trial and error. By the end of the war, a fairly sophisticated body of doctrine existed for the battlefield uses of aircraft.

While attacking bombers usually could get to their targets (especially in the early phases of an air campaign before adequate air defenses could be brought to bear), it was difficult for them to bomb accurately and thus achieve serious levels of destruction. Also, the limited numbers of bombers put a low ceiling on the damage that could be achieved through air attacks. Improving defenses around valuable targets would make it increasingly difficult for attackers to reach those targets unscathed. All this meant that it was hard to produce any systematic reduction of the enemy war economy. However, by 1917-18, some rather impressive plans were worked out, in particular by the British, for long-range bombing. One planner in particular, Lord Tiverton, produced sophisticated targeting plans while he worked for the Royal Naval Air Service and later on the staff of the newly independent Royal Air Force.

3
However, the very fact that long-range bombing had been a marginal effort compared to the vast clashes of ground forces meant that the wartime experience was not the end of the story, but only the beginning. To the emerging air power advocates, the experience suggested trends for the future-trends that could be extrapolated and fleshed out through a bit of imagination and visioning. At the end of the war, interpretations of the value of independent air operations varied widely. 
4
During the interwar years, those making bold claims for air power gained degrees of legitimacy for a variety of reasons. The war had indicated that technological advancement could take place in a highly telescoped way. Many observers thus concluded that the technological development of air power would be fast and relentless-and that the capabilities of bombers would outstrip the capabilities of fighters. In a related way, they systematically downplayed the prospects for ground-based defenses. Many assumed that some of the most daunting weapons of the war (including chemicals and gas) would see intensified and expanded use in any future war. While these observers viewed such expansion as regrettable, they also believed it would have the effect of shortening wars-because wars would become so terrible and unendurable. Air advocates argued this in reaction to the trench stalemate of World War I-a catastrophe that politicians were eager to avoid repeating. Air power, its advocates argued, would restore the impact of offensive operations to the battlefield, and would offer the prospect of directly undermining the enemy's all-important "will to fight." Finally, air advocates argued that all modern states would embrace airplanes as essential tools of war and deterrence, insisting that those which failed to do so would put themselves at an enormous disadvantage in the ongoing competition among nations.
Giulio Douhet was born into a military family and became an artillery officer. By 1909, Douhet had begun thinking seriously about air power, and, prior to the start of World War I, he commanded the Italian Army's aviation section. During the war, he recommended breaking the land war stalemate with Austria by using a 500-plane bomber force. Because his proposal also contained a strong critique of Italian military leaders, he was court-martialed. However, he was recalled to service in 1918 to head the Italian Central Aeronautical Bureau.

Hugh Montague Trenchard served as a field commander for the British Army's Royal Flying Corps during World War I. He would ultimately become known as the "Father of the Royal Air Force," although this was ironic, since he initially had little interest in the creation of a separate service. The establishment of an independent air service in Britain came about because of public demands for better air defense and retaliation following German air attacks on Britain (beginning in 1915 with Zeppelin raids and escalating to bomber raids by 1917). Trenchard was called on to be the first head of a long-range bombardment force (the "Independent Force") in 1918. He accepted the task reluctantly. Since he had relatively few airplanes, he had little ability to implement any kind of systematic bombardment of the German war economy. It was clear to him, though, that the British public expected to see results from the retaliatory raids. Able to produce little sustained destruction of German targets, he argued expediently that the psychological effect of bombardment was much greater than the physical effect.

Trenchard proved to be a particularly effective bureaucratic infighter, resurrecting his wartime arguments about the psychological or "moral" (pronounced "morale") effect of air war, and claiming that an attacking air force would be in a position to undermine an enemy's will to fight by placing pressure directly on the enemy population. Attacks on enemy "vital centers" would cause the enemy population to call for better air defenses (as the British had done in World War I). The heavier and more persistent these offensive attacks, the more the enemy would be driven on the defensive by popular cries for protection. The enemy's increasing defensive effort would soak up resources and would place the enemy state on a slippery slope from which it could not recover. Many of Trenchard's ideas were articulated in the memorandum he wrote for the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (May 1928) on "The War Object of an Air Force." Quotations from that text follow below (original spelling used).
I would state definitely that in the view of the Air Staff the object to be sought by air action will be to paralyse from the very outset the enemy's productive centres of munitions of war of every sort and to stop all communication and transportation.
Air power can . . . pass over the enemy navies and armies, and penetrate the air defenses and attack directly the centres of production, transportation and communication from which the enemy war effort is maintained. It will from time to time certainly be found advantageous to turn to the attack of an enemy air base, but such attacks will not be the main operation. For his main operation, each belligerent will set out to attack directly those objectives which he considers most vital to the enemy. Each will penetrate the defenses of the other to a certain degree. The stronger side, by developing the more powerful offensive, will provoke in his weaker enemy increasingly insistent calls for the protective employment of aircraft. In this way he will throw the enemy on to the defensive and it will be in this manner that air superiority will be obtained, and not by direct destruction of air forces.
What is illegitimate . . . is the indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole purpose of terrorising the civilian population. It is an entirely different matter to terrorise munition workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work or stevedores into abandoning the loading of a ship with munitions through fear of air attack upon the factory or dock concerned. . . . [A]ir attacks will be directed against any objectives which will contribute effectively towards the destruction of the enemy's means of resistance and the lowering of his determination to fight.
We shall attack the vital centres of transportation and seriously impede these arms and munitions reaching the battlefield and, therefore, more successfully assist the Army in its direct attack on the enemy's Army. We shall attack the communications without which the national effort cannot be co-ordinated and directed.
The moral effect of such attacks is very great. Even in the last war ten years ago, before any of the heavier bombers had really been employed to any extent, the moral effect of such sporadic raids as were then practicable was considerable. With the greater numbers of aircraft, the larger carrying capacity and range, and the heavier bombs available today, the effect would seriously impede the work of the enemy's Navy, Army, and Air Forces. . . . Once a raid has been experienced false alarms are incessant and a state of panic remains in which work comes to a standstill.
There can be no question, whatever views we may hold in regard to it, that this form of warfare will be used. . . . Whatever we may wish or hope . . . there is not the slightest doubt that in the next war both sides will send their aircraft out without scruple to bomb those objectives which they consider to be most suitable.

William L. "Billy" Mitchell, son of a wealthy Wisconsin Senator, enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army during the Spanish American War and later gained a commission. He served successfully in the Signal Corps and began taking flying lessons at the age of 38. Mitchell went to France in 1917 (as a lieutenant colonel), and helped pave the way for an American air contribution to the war. A tireless and flamboyant leader, he rose quickly to Brigadier General, commanding all American air units in France. He led nearly 1,500 aircraft in the 1918 battle of St. Mihiel. Despite his rapid rise, though, Mitchell alienated many with his aggressive style and tendency toward self-righteousness.
On his return from the war, Mitchell continued to be controversial. He feuded with his own service, and his air attacks on stationary battleships in 1921 and 1923 placed him in the midst of a passionate fight with the Navy. His harsh criticism of the crash of the Navy dirigible Shenandoah (he argued there had been "an almost treasonable administration of the national defense") led to his court-martial and ouster from the Army. 
15
Below are direct quotations from Mitchell's 1925 book, Winged Defense: The Development and Possibilities of Modern Air Power -Economic and Military:
The air-going people actually form a separate class. They are more different from landsmen than are landsmen from seamen. At the present time, the air-going people in the national services are not accorded the position nor the rank to which the importance of their duties entitles them.
The world stands on the threshold of the 'aeronautical era.' During this epoch the destinies of all people will be controlled through the air.
The air force has ceased to remain a mere auxiliary service for the purpose of assisting an army or navy in the execution of its task. . . . The air force fights in three dimensions -on the level, from up above, and from underneath. . . . [To date] the only defenses against aircraft are other aircraft which will contest the supremacy of the air by air battles. Great contests for air control will be the rule in the future. Once supremacy of the air has been established, airplanes can fly over a hostile country at will. How can a hostile air force be forced to fight, it may be asked, if they do not desire to leave the ground? The air strategist answers: 'By finding a location of such importance to the enemy that he must defend it against a bombardment attack by airplanes.' As air power can hit at a distance, after it controls the air and vanquishes the opposing air power it will be able to fly anywhere over the hostile country. The menace will be so great that either a state will hesitate to go to war, or, having engaged in war, will make the contest much sharper, more decisive, and more quickly finished. This will result in a diminished loss of life and treasure and will thus be a distinct benefit to civilization. Air forces will attack centers of production of all kinds, means of transportation, agricultural areas, ports and shipping; not so much the people themselves. . . . Today to make war we must have great metal and chemical factories that have to stay in one place, take months to build, and, if destroyed, cannot be replaced in the usual length of a modern war.
The role of armies and their way of making war will remain much the same in the future as it has in the past, if air power does not entirely prevent them from operating. Navies, however, are able to control only the areas of water outside of the cruising radius of aircraft. These areas are constantly diminishing with the increasing flying powers of aircraft. It will be impossible for them to bombard or blockade a coast as they used to, or to ascend the rivers, bays, or estuaries of a country adequately provided with air power.
Each year the leading countries of the world are recognizing the value of air power more and more. . . . People who are unused to or unfamiliar with air work are incapable of visioning what air power should be, of training the men necessary for work in the air, or of devising the equipment that they should have.
It was proved in the European war [WWI] that the only effective defense against aerial attack is to whip the enemy's air forces in air battles. In other words, seizing the initiative, forcing the enemy to the defensive in his own territory, attacking his most important ground positions, menacing his airplanes on the ground, in the hangars, on the airdromes and in the factories so that he will be forced to take the air and defend them. . . . The whole arrangement of ground protection against aircraft, sound ranging, searchlights and guns cannot stand up under intelligent air attack and is incapable of serious effect on airplanes. The only defense against aircraft is by hitting the enemy first, just as far away from home as possible. The idea of defending the country against air attack by machine guns or anti-aircraft cannons from the ground is absolutely incapable of being carried out. 
16
In the 1920s, bombers did tend to develop more quickly than fighters. However, the momentum began to shift in the 1930s as fighter development began to catch up. Moreover, the advent of radar changed the air defense equation very significantly.

18
The role that a nation's air force played going into World War II varied with that nation's history, experience, and geopolitical situation. Nearly all industrialized nations took an interest in air power and long-range bombardment. However, not all nations developed the latter. Under Trenchard and his successors, the RAF developed and espoused a doctrine for strategic bombing, but did not back it up with rigorous analysis of how to carry out such bombing effectively. The French, the leading aviation power in World War I, never entirely recovered from the devastating effects of that war. Economic and political problems, as well as overall war-weariness, kept France from regaining any semblance of the position she had held up to 1917-18. Russia, wracked by civil war and then devastated by the paranoid politics of Josef Stalin, recovered only just in time to save herself (with Allied help) from Adolf Hitler. The Russians would develop highly capable air power in the course of World War II, but it remained tied closely to the Red Army. Although the Versailles agreement had prevented Germany from having an interwar air force, the Germans continued to take an interest in aviation and in long-range bombing (and retained very active glider clubs!). The development of advanced, long-range bombers lagged in Germany for a variety of reasons under Hitler. 
19
The Americans, despite taking an interest in the antics and aggressive salesmanship of Billy Mitchell, did not feel the need to create an independent air service before World War II. The United States was largely defensive in its military posture, and those serving officers who wrote about air warfare had to do so within careful boundaries. Nonetheless, the organization that was first called the U.S. Army Air Service, then the Air Corps, and later the Army Air Forces, did gain increasing levels of autonomy during the interwar years. Ideas about bombing an enemy war economy-developed by Britain's Tiverton and his colleagues and incorporated into World War I planning by the American, Lieutenant Colonel Edgar S. Gorrell-were preserved in the documents and lectures of the Air Service and Air Corps School system. In 1926 another unsung hero of air power, William C. Sherman, put forward an early but articulate version of what would become, in the 1930s, the "industrial fabric" theory of bombing heralded by the Air Corps Tactical School. Sherman, an instructor of air tactics at Fort Leavenworth, was mindful about the moral and ethical ramifications of bombing city centers, and he was, in any event, most interested in finding and hitting an enemy's specific industrial sites. He wrote: Industry consists . . . of a complex system of interlocking factories, each of which makes only its allotted part of the whole. . . . Accordingly, in the majority of industries it is necessary to destroy certain elements of the industry only, in order to cripple the whole. . . . On the declaration of war, these key plants should be made the object of a systematic bombardment . . . until they have been sufficiently crippled." 
20
In the late-1930s, the British realized there was a considerable discrepancy between their bomber doctrine and their capacity for carrying it out. They tried to close the gap prior to the start of the war, but did not make great progress. The Battle of France revealed that neither the French nor the British had paid nearly enough attention to air-ground cooperation on the battlefield. While Trenchard and his colleagues had given rhetorical prominence to long-range bombing, they had not-happily-neglected air defense. This enabled the British to prevail in their quest to maintain control over their own air space during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940. Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering, boastful about the capabilities of his force, was embarrassed by the Luftwaffe's failure and by the British retaliatory attacks against Berlin that he had argued were impossible. However, the Germans, like the British, constructed formidable defenses centered on radar, and this had the effect of greatly disrupting British plans for their own air offensive. The British discovered early in the war that they could not bomb in daylight without prohibitive losses, and they thus shifted to nighttime attacks. The RAF knew that such raids would suffer from inaccuracy, but they did not fully appreciate the degradation until the summer of 1941, when a thorough photo-reconnaissance analysis revealed that only about one in five bombers was getting within five miles of its target. In February 1942, the British formalized what had become obvious: Since cities were the only targets that Bomber Command could reliably find and hit at that time, Bomber Command would attack German cities, particularly those areas with dense populations of workers.

Both the RAF and the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) were learning institutions, and they were able to continue to prosecute their offensives even as they adapted to the very demanding conditions that they had failed to anticipate. The British improved their navigation, bomb aiming, and the overall sophistication of their tactics throughout the war; by 1944, they were able to hit specific targets under the right conditions. Likewise, the insistent American determination to defeat the Luftwaffe proved to be deeply consequential. The attainment of air superiority over Europe made the D-day Landings a feasible operation, kept the bombing offensives alive, hastened the progress of Anglo-American armies eastward, and opened the skies to more devastating bombardment than had been possible earlier in the war.
Civilian populations proved to be much less fragile and much more robust than the interwar theorists had predicted. British civilians during the Blitz and German civilians during the long years of Anglo-American air attacks found ways to adjust to life under fire. Indeed, British experts discovered, much to their surprise, that many of their expectations turned out to be exactly wrong. Rather than the nervousness and psychosis they expected to see, British psychologists and doctors saw rates of suicide and drunkenness fall; they saw bombed populations pull together, overcoming previous class differences. 
26
Finally, culture could play a role, too. The strong commitment to the Emperor, who held religious status in Japanese society, made it difficult for Japanese civilians to turn their anger or desperation toward the existing government.
Because the strategic bombing of World War II did not have the early and profound impact that the interwar theorists had predicted, many postwar analysts concluded that it had failed to live up to its promise and had contributed only marginally to victory. However, these harsh critiques deserve carefully scrutiny. In any analysis, the first issue to consider is whether a different expenditure of resources would have been likely or even possible. Neither Britain nor the United States was comfortable with large standing armies (since they were not continental powers, they had no overriding need for such armies). They both had bitter memories of World War I and were anxious not to repeat that experience. They were both technologically advanced and proud of their industrial heritage and capabilities. It is unrealistic to expect that they would have eschewed the promise of air power (alongside sea power) in favor of a strategy that relied principally on armies and tactical aviation.
The second issue is the actual performance of aircraft in the war in both long-range and tactical applications. Even if bombing in Europe was imprecise and highly imperfect, it still served to place a ceiling on the expansion of the German war economy. Moreover, this effect was crucial at certain moments in the war. Bomber Command's 1943 campaign against the Ruhr for instance, prevented German munitions czar Albert Speer from carrying out a vast expansion of German munitions production in that year-an expansion that would have greatly benefited the Germans on the Eastern Front. 
27
28
Unfortunately, the interwar theorists' assumption that air war would be too terrible to be endured for long did not prove to be the case. The moral ramifications of long-range bombardment in both the European and Far Eastern theaters cannot be sidestepped. Anglo-American wartime decisions had immense consequences for enemy civilians. As we critique those decisions, though, we must look carefully at the possible alternatives and their likely ramifications: What would the outcomes and costs have been if there had been no long-range bombing used in the war? What would they have been if the bombing had been waged in a far-more-restricted way? Once they discovered that "precision" bombing of industrial targets was frequently impossible, should the Anglo-Americans have reconfigured their war effort?
The debates over air power that began with Douhet, Trenchard, and Mitchell were not resolved during World War II. Indeed, in many respects they intensified. Many analysts accused air forces of overselling their wares and falling short on their promises. Air advocates fought back by pointing to the many wartime contributions of air power. General Henry "Hap" Arnold, who commanded the USAAF during the war, was one of its most outspoken proponents and defenders. He not only put his service in a good position to achieve independence by 1947, but he also envisioned a future filled with many more tools of aerial warfare, including long-range missiles. Another passionate advocate of this era was Alexander de Seversky, a Russian who became a U.S. citizen in the 1920s and, in the 1930s, started the Seversky Aircraft Corporation. In his 1942 book, Victory Through Air Power, he wrote: "The most significant single fact about the war now in progress is the emergence of aviation as the paramount and decisive factor in warmaking. . . . All experts agree that air power will play an ever more decisive part in determining the power balance among the nations of the earth." With regard to future aviation, he argued: "We must not merely outbuild any potential enemy or combination of enemies-that is the lesser half of the job for a machine-age nation like the United States. We must out-think and out-plan them, in a spirit of creative audacity." 29
After World War II, bomber aircraft became the centerpiece of the American nuclear deterrent. The possession of such a strike force enabled the Americans to hold enemy assets at risk from a long distance. While the USAAF would have won its autonomy after the war anyway, the nuclear mission underscored the legitimacy of that autonomy, and brought considerable resources to the newly created Strategic Air Command (SAC). SAC started to become a highly professional and capable force in the late-1940s. Under the fiscally conservative Dwight Eisenhower administration, SAC offered the United States a reasonably inexpensive way of balancing against the large army maintained by the postwar Soviet Union. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) was a SAC-dominated institution; its focus was geared toward maintaining a robust deterrent force that would head off a nuclear conflict between the superpowers. (SAC's motto was "Peace is our Profession.")
The two Asian wars fought by the Americans during the Cold War, in Korea and Vietnam, were frustrating for practitioners of long-range bombardment. Early restrictions on long-range bombing tended to erode as the wars dragged on and became increasingly costly. Incendiary attacks on Pyongyang, Korea, in early-January 1951, burned out 35 percent of the city. Training for atomic missions went forward, but authorities withheld permission for actual use of A-bombs.

When President Lyndon Johnson and his advisors dramatically increased the U.S. commitment to South Vietnam in 1964-65, they hoped that air power might facilitate a relatively quick and painless campaign that would not divert too many resources from the broader national agenda, including Johnson's "Great Society" program. They hoped that air strikes would demonstrate U.S. resolve, convince North Vietnam that supporting the insurgency in the South would be too costly, bolster morale in the South, erode the morale of Viet Cong cadres, and generally intimidate the leadership of the insurgency, thereby convincing them that they could not win.

The command structure . . . is the only element of the enemy . . . that can make concessions. In fact, wars through history have been fought to change (or change the mind of) the command structure-to overthrow the prince literally or figuratively or to induce the command structure to make concessions. . . . In modern times, however, it has become more difficult-but not impossible-to capture or kill the command element. At the same time, command communications have been more important than ever, and these are vulnerable to attack. When command communications suffer extreme damage . . . the leadership has great difficulty in directing war efforts. In the case of an unpopular regime, the lack of communications not only inhibits the bolstering of national morale but also facilitates rebellion on the part of dissident elements. 
42
Even though the aircraft coming into the theater comprised the vast majority of the USAF's precision-delivery capability at the time, the force was not ideally suited to the task Warden had set for it. Technological evolution throughout the Vietnam War had yielded some promising results in highly precise, guided-bomb technology, but the Air Force had been leisurely in acquiring it. 
43
The Black Hole planners, led by Lieutenant Colonel David Deptula, updated the air war plan right through the opening hours of the war on January 17, 1991; they emphasized simultaneous attacks on target sets that would have overlapping and linking effects. Rather than attacking targets in sequenced priority order, Coalition air forces were able to carry out simultaneous counter-air, interdiction, close air support, and strategic missions into Iraq. By mid-February, Coalition bombers had struck the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, the Baghdad Conference Center, TV and press buildings, and the Military Intelligence Headquarters. As the month went on, strategic attacks targeted airfields, nuclear and chemical sites, communication facilities, and mobile Scud missile launchers.
Attacks on Iraqi communication targets had a corrosive effect on the speed and efficiency with which Saddam could conduct his war. However, fiber-optic nets were more redundant and elusive than the Black Hole had anticipated. The precise military and political impact of raids on leadership targets-the focus of Warden's theory-has been difficult to discern. As historian Richard Davis concluded, "little solid data is available to connect the bombing of leadership or command and control facilities with specific consequences."

The 5 months between the invasion of Kuwait and the commencement of Operation DESERT STORM gave Saddam time to further disperse and hide his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capability-a set of resources already dispersed in reaction to the Israeli strike in 1981. The targets proved to be elusive, and postwar inspections revealed that the target planners (who had operated with limited and outdated intelligence) had missed many facilities.
The Coalition achieved its main aims, including the withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the right of the United Nations (UN) to install peacekeepers on the border, and the right to inspect and eliminate any WMD in Iraq. The speed and apparent ease of the victory prompted many commentators to proclaim that a "revolution in military affairs" (RMA) had occurred, based on the sophisticated technology employed by American forces. Indeed, the one-sided outcome had resulted from the interaction of American proficiency and Iraqi incompetence. Poor skills and training ensured that the enemy's modern military toolkit and operational proficiency punished Iraqi armies disproportionately.

In 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) went to war in an air-only operation, trying to halt Serbian mistreatment of the population in the province of Kosovo. Ethnic Serbs formed a small part (about 10 percent) of the population of the province, which consisted mainly of Albanian Muslims. The failure to bring the opposed parties together at the Rambouillet Conference in early-1999 led to a NATO decision to try to coerce the Serbian President, Solbodan Milosevic, and the Serbs into accepting terms. The Bill Clinton administration expected Milosevic to cave in under air strikes in a few days. In actuality, he encouraged his forces to run amok in Kosovo and compounded the problem. Muslims poured out of the province and into refugee camps in neighboring states. Air strikes, waged from high altitude to minimize the risk to NATO pilots, could not halt events on the ground, and the strikes seemed only to unify the defiant Serbs behind Milosevic. NATO was cautious in all regards, and there was considerable anxiety about whether the alliance would hang together. President Clinton, who could hardly escape recent memories of the American public's ambivalence about Bosnia, would not agree to the use of ground troops. In May, an increasingly alarmed NATO took advantage of improving weather to intensify the bombing-attacking rail lines and bridges in Kosovo and Serbia and striking the electrical net inside Serbia. Significantly, NATO began to discuss the use of ground troops. This put the Russians-old allies of the Serbs-in a particularly awkward situation, since they had no intention of ending up in a shooting war with NATO. Pressure from the Russians surely helped convince Milosevic that he had to accept defeat. The bombing ceased in June, and the United States and NATO sent a force of 60,000 troops (Kosovo Force, or KFOR) into Kosovo. Milosevic, who in the meantime had been indicted as a war criminal by the International Criminal Tribunal, was ousted from power in the autumn of 2000.

Any historical outcome is driven by a particular interweaving of events and perceptions of events, and those seeking to explain historical events must identify the contributing elements and arrange them into a structure that is logically coherent and robust relative to other possible explanations. However, fitting together the puzzle pieces is a complex process that tends to develop slowly as additional bits of evidence come to light and as the perspectives of all the key actors are brought to bear on the story. The very fact that NATO managed to sustain a 78-day campaign that-Milosevic believed-might have continued indefinitely, must have convinced the Serb leader that his opponents were committed to the cause. As another RAND analyst, Stephen Hosmer, has pointed out, Milosevic and others in his circle seemed to fear that there might be no limit to the level of destruction NATO might be willing to impose; indeed NATO, led by the United States and Britain, might continue escalating to the point of "carpet bombing" Serbia.

Although the decade of the 1990s was tumultuous, the first decade of the new millennium would prove to be even more so. The U.S. Air Force had important roles to play in the wars fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq and in the stabilization efforts that have followed those wars.
U.S. Air Force Basic Doctrine dated November 17, 2003, echoed elements of Warden and Deptula:
The US Air Force provides the Nation a unique capability to project national influence anywhere in the world on very short notice. Air and space forces, through their inherent speed, range, and flexibility, can respond to national requirements by delivering precise military power to create effects where and when needed.
The 'American way of war' has long been described as warfare based on either a strategy of annihilation or of attrition and focused on engaging the enemy in close combat to achieve a decisive battle. Air and space power, if properly focused, offers our national leadership alternatives to the annihilation and attrition options. It is possible to directly affect adversary sources of strength and will to fight by creating shock and destroying enemy cohesion without close combat. While such attacks may not totally eliminate the need to directly engage the adversary's fielded military forces, they can shape those en-gagements so they occur at the time and place of our choosing under conditions more likely to lead to decisive outcomes with minimized risk to friendly forces. The aggressive use of air and space power can also reduce the size of forces needed for conflict termination, risking fewer American lives.
Strategic attack is defined as offensive action conducted by command authorities aimed at generating effects that most directly achieve our national security objectives by affecting the adversary's leadership, conflict-sustaining resources, and strategy. . . . As a concept, strategic attack builds on the idea that it is possible to directly affect an adversary's sources of strength and will to fight without first having to engage and defeat their military forces.
Even though strategic attack best describes the airman's overall vision for striking the enemy, counterair is the pivotal prerequisite for success. Counterair consists of operations to attain and maintain a desired degree of air superiority by the destruction, degradation, or disruption of enemy forces. 
53
54
In counterinsurgency operations, the use of air strikes independent of ground operations can be tricky and, indeed, at times, counterproductive. A misguided bomb that kills civilians can quickly upset efforts to win hearts and minds, undermining the strategic purpose of the campaign. Insurgent forces that often control the pace of the war can use cover and concealment to avoid air strikes much of the time. In addition, these forces may intermingle with civilians in urban areas or use human shields to protect themselves from the superior air power wielded by their opponents. All of these factors put very real constraints on the use of air power. They do not, however, rule out the use of air power in counterinsurgency campaigns. Moreover, inter-and intra-theater transport of personnel and equipment is always a critical mission.
If used carefully and sparingly, independent air strikes can be invaluable in reaching highvalue targets. Moreover, with the precision capabilities now available-particularly through unmanned aerial vehicles-such strikes can target particular individuals who may be instrumental in the planning and implementing of terrorist activity. However, caution, care, and intentionality are warranted. As Major Jason Brown wrote in 2007:
When operational-level commanders can 'watch' insurgents in real time by means of ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] feeds, they tend to fall back to the tactical level, thus reinforcing the 'we must do something now' mentality. This reactive approach can quickly devolve into a game of 'whack a mole,' which can cause commanders to neglect other important lines of operation and lose focus on the strategic end state.
To avoid this, Brown insists that "commanders and planners must integrate the use of airpower for dynamic targeting into the operational design of a counterinsurgency campaign."

Military strategists and practitioners develop and execute campaign plans based on a host of factors. Experience, intelligence, force structure, technology, legal, the threat, and environmental factors are only a few elements that affect these decisions. Another key factor is theory. Theory attempts to explain and get a reader to understand the occurrence of an event or state of nature. Theory can provide a framework to consider how to approach a problem. It can help one consider issues or questions to solve before making detailed approaches toward developing a theater strategy or campaign plan. If a theory is sound, then one could use it to solve problems by predicting possible outcomes, identifying potential problems, and finding options to get an opponent to take certain actions or modify his behavior. Theory can provide a foundation to help military strategists contemplate or evaluate potential courses of actions.
Military theory is often criticized, not without justification, for being unrealistic or static. Theory may not seem relevant because it lacks details or does not adequately represent a situation. Additionally, a theorist may have created an appropriate theory for his age or historic context that does not seem to fit the contemporary environment. Societies, militaries, weapons, and political situations may evolve such that the theory may not be relevant. A theorist may have worked during a particular period with certain international conditions or technology available to fight a war. Over time, political relationships change, engineers replace technology, and the character of warfare evolves.
Although compared with other weapons like small arms, aircraft are relatively new weapons; they have changed significantly since the first Italian aircraft appeared in combat over Libya in 1911.

Since the end of World War II, technology has changed significantly to include jet aircraft, radar, surface-to-air missiles, nuclear weapons, instant communications, improved reconnaissance and surveillance, improved bomb damage assessment, and precision guided munitions. Ideas that were once discounted as unrealistic might now find validity, due to improvements in fighting capability, increased urbanization, enhanced intelligence abilities to pinpoint key targets, and other changes. One recent air power theorist, John A. Warden III, believed that a state would collapse if sufficient pressure was placed on certain key elements of its government, economy, society, and military. Many World War II United States Army Air Forces (AAF) and British Royal Air Force officers agonized over what targets would accomplish this same goal. Eighth Air Force B-17 and B-24 bomber crews smashed industrial targets, while losing thousands of crewmembers and creating massive collateral damage, in search of a way to force Germany to capitulate. Warden built many of his ideas on concepts developed during the interwar period before World War II, Warden believed that advances in technology-precision guided munitions and stealth had made revolutionary changes to the nature of warfare. Instead of using masses of bombers as in World War II, a single stealthy plane today, armed with precision guided munitions, could destroy a target. This fundamental change in aerial operations increased the options a commander had available in battle. Aircraft could attack several targets simultaneously with surprise. Precision guided munitions gave aircrews the ability to destroy or disable a target with a single mission instead of returning repeatedly to a target. Modern technology allowed air forces to avoid having to go to battle against the strength of most nation-states-their military. Attacks on several centers of gravity created more chaos and damage to an enemy than a single, direct clash between opposing militaries. Centers of gravity are targets that if destroyed or disabled have a significant impact on a nation's war-making capability. Warden thought that technology freed campaign planners to consider more options to strike an enemy. A main concern involved not how many aircraft or systems could attack a target, but what type of target should military forces damage or destroy? Commanders needed to consider what effects that strikes on the targets would have on the enemy. They also had to question whether a particular sequence of attacks made sense.
John Warden was able to employ his ideas directly in a campaign plan without the concern of interpretation or potential misapplication of his ideas. Unlike some theorists, Warden was able to translate his ideas into actual combat planning for operations in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The use of his ideas and concepts for that situation is a prime example of how a military theory guided campaign planning and how to think about what targets to destroy or disable. Although geared toward a state-on-state confrontation, one might ponder how much of his theory may or may not be relevant to the rise of conflict with nonstate actors or states that do not have discernable centers of gravity.
Colonel John Warden believed that nation-states operate like biological organisms composed of discrete systems. In a perfect world these systems function in harmony and the organisms survive and flourish. However, certain systems controlled other systems and were thus significant, while other elements might appear to be vital, they were actually not important for sustaining the organism. Warden believed that like a biological organism, a nation could be stunned. Military action could produce strategic paralysis. Strategic paralysis in Warden's terms would make an enemy incapable of taking any physical action to conduct operations. 
3
Warden believed that organizations from nation-states to terrorist organizations have a common critical feature: some type of leadership. An individual or a command group with control capability provides guidance and direction to that organization. Without this system, the organization would flounder and particular functions cease to exist or become severely limited. This leadership function has become a vital "center" of action against which an attacker should focus its military actions. Once an attacker neutralizes the "leadership" function, other systems become vulnerable for further assault or become neutralized. Ultimately, the goal of striking leadership targets was to destroy the psyche of the enemy's top command. Determining the level of success against the enemy's psyche is difficult, if not impossible. Warden reasoned that an attacker could only view the physical manifestations of the enemy that would help identify targets that would comply with this scheme. 
4
Instead of attacking the "muscle" of the system, Warden advocated striking an enemy through a more indirect approach and creating a similar effect. A military force could clash directly in a conventional battle that could result in an attritional battle or a decisive encounter. However, if the leadership of the state was either disabled or unable to provide guidance to its forces, it might be possible to render those military assets useless much faster. Warden became an advocate for an indirect approach to warfare. This emphasis was developed while Warden was a graduate student at Texas Tech University, where he developed an affinity to British military theorist, Basil H. Liddell Hart.

Warden, a career Air Force fighter pilot, predicted that air power could play a pivotal role in conducting operations through an indirect approach. Given the nature of modern aircraft, support capabilities, and precision guided munitions, air power could destroy or disable systems that range from leadership to economic capabilities. Unlike the World War I and II aircraft that required a mass of inaccurate munitions to destroy a command and control center or other target, technology had improved, allowing a single aircraft to deliver munitions within a few feet of its intended target quickly. Aircraft, if a country attained air superiority, were free to attack several different types of targets simultaneously. This ability to strike many targets would confuse an enemy by not letting a foe determine the direction and focus of an attack. This approach allowed aircrews to conduct parallel warfare, and a commander could strike fast over a wide range of objectives. Other forces might need to attack in a slower, more linear manner. For example, ground forces would have to defeat a similar military force first, before proceeding to other targets like the rival's transportation networks or leadership. Aircraft could bypass the enemy's ground forces and strike directly against the capital, industrial centers, or other targets.
Although airplanes could attack most nation-states independently, Warden was careful to note that air power alone might not be sufficient or efficient enough to use exclusively to attack an enemy. 
7
Warden's theoretical blueprint for using air power would combine non-physical (or, in his term, "morale") and physical effects on warfare. Non-physical factors include the impact of fog, friction, and other psychological effects on national leadership, military, and civilian populations. Physical targets included military forces and means to fight war. Warden believed that the relationship between the two was defined by the equation Morale x Physical = Outcome. He realized that attacking morale was difficult. Modern technology could do much to reduce the impact of friction and fog through better communications and the availability of information; however, a military force could not completely negate friction, fog, or morale issues. A nation could not guarantee its ability to predict perfectly an enemy's intentions and actions. Unexpected enemy actions could also affect any outcome.
Physical damage to enemy forces or economic targets is easier to accomplish. If an attack could significantly reduce the enemy through physical damage, then morale considerations might be moot. This approach assumes that the nation can identify correctly the appropriate physical targets. Alternatively, "morale factors" could change the physical dimension of warfare. Leadership could exhort workers to produce more munitions or the populace to support the war effort better. Conversely, the attacks on physical targets could alter the morale of population and affect the ability of a rival to discern an attacker's intention; this may create the fog of war. Pressure on enemy leadership or the adversary's population, based on physical attacks, could affect morale and may change enemy behavior. For example, the relentless bombing of economic targets could cause significant disruptions in the everyday lives of workers. If conditions were bad enough, prominent members of the population might confront the national leadership with demands to negotiate or submit to the enemy. Short of such radical steps, opinion leaders and the general public might begin to openly question national policy.
John Warden selected five general areas or systems that he believed were key centers of gravity to exploit against any foe. This model provided a framework to analyze how to disable an enemy using strategic paralysis. The systems Warden picked were: leadership, organic essentials, infrastructure, population, and fielded military forces. One could envision this model as a series of five concentric rings, with the most important element in the center and progressively less important ones moving outward. A way to think about defeating an enemy was to attack the concentric circles from "inside out." That is, disable the most important center of gravity first, and work outward to less important rings, see Figure 
21-1
Leadership was at the center of Warden's ring model. In his biological system analogy, leadership equated to the brain of a living organism. The most important leadership in a state was the government, because it could ultimately decide to concede in a conflict to another state. Leadership, above all else, was the primary center of gravity in a state. If the national leadership was isolated, disabled, or destroyed, then the country could not function. Leadership requires an ability to gather, process, and act on information-all functions that an adversary might strike and affect the functioning of a nation-state. Direct attacks against enemy leaders, command and control structures, or headquarters could affect an opponent's ability to continue a conflict. The LINEBACKER II bombing campaign in December 1972 impressed Warden. In his opinion, the campaign forced the North Vietnamese government to return to peace negotiations with the United States.

Leadership targets can include executive, legislative, judicial, and other functions. Campaign planners could target physical governmental facilities. Attacking the means these targets use to coordinate or control activities within the nation requires a Herculean effort. Additionally, striking leadership targets of nonstate actors that do not have established facilities or locations can create problems. Conversely, foes with a loose confederation of leadership, such as a cartel or combined revolutionary movements, who are highly mobile, may not lend themselves to a rapid attack. Living organisms do not exist on their brains alone. An organism needs certain raw materials to live. Organic essentials provide elements to function, grow, and replace damaged tissues. Similarly, a state cannot exist on leadership alone. It needs raw materials that include sources of energy, food, and financial resources to maintain its existence. These raw materials provide energy to the entire state. Attacking such targets, especially food sources, needs careful consideration because of ethical issues and other strategic implications like the national and international opinion. However, industrial countries require oil to fuel industry and transportation that, if effectively interdicted, could slow industrial and military operations to a crawl. The lack of energy can influence national leadership's behavior and limit severely actions by subordinate actors in the state. Warden believed that successive degradation of a state's organic essentials could lead to the collapse of the entire system; create conditions for a state that make it physically difficult or impossible for the state to continue a policy or fight; and force significant political and economic impacts due to damage to the ring. 
10
Warden's next ring is infrastructure. Infrastructure is like the vessels, bones, and muscles in the human body that allow an organism to move and take action. Society's infrastructure includes, among other things, road and rail networks, airports, power grids and factories. Potential infrastructure targets include a long list of activities-some of which are more valuable than others. Attacking rail lines may take months or years to destroy hundreds of thousands of miles of track. Destroying or disabling key infrastructure requires a careful analysis to find vital elements that, if struck, could disrupt operations. For example, instead of trying to bomb rail lines, a single bombing of a key bridge, tunnel, or rail junction might accomplish the same purpose. Commanders may need to consider the post-conflict impact of infrastructure attacks. Reconstruction of needed roads, rail lines, and other targets after the conflict may add time and cost to returning the nation to a normal state after the war. It might be wise to avoid destroying infrastructure you might need for your own purposes or will have to repair after the conflict.
The fourth ring is the population. Attacking the population does not focus solely on bombing civilians, but could also include using psychological warfare or other activities to reduce a populace's morale. Like an organism composed of millions of cells that can survive the loss of many of those cells, a nation can endure some loss of population. However, economic and military support might falter under air attack if the public perceives its losses are too high. The effect of bombing population is extremely unpredictable. Examples of increased morale under bombardment are numerous. Also, if organic essentials are limited, then a reduction in unessential parts of the population may actually improve the state's ability to operate by relieving pressure on limited resources.
The last ring comprises fielded military forces. Fielded military forces represent the "fighting mechanism" that protects the state from attack. Warden makes an organic analogy to leukocytes or white blood cells that ward off viruses. 
11
Commanders should take a systems approach to warfare. Instead of destroying an entire foe, attacks on key system components could render a strategic effect. This type of approach forces one to consider how to derive a specific end-paralysis-using specific ways-attacks on subsystems or rings. John Warden's theory of identifying and creating a priority of subsystems allowed strategic planners the ability to attack in a specific order. However, Warden also stressed that a combination of varying size and scope of attacks could create certain vulnerabilities to the rings themselves. For example, attacking infrastructure, like transportation networks, could alter the ability of fielded military forces to move and engage against another military force. Likewise, striking industrial targets that manufacture weapons or munitions could also delay or affect the fielded military forces. Thus, selecting the correct targets and assessing the probable effect of their destruction on the system becomes a prime concern.
Many of Warden's ideas had surfaced earlier. Early air power theories and concepts in the United States were developed as a part of the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Maxwell Field in Alabama. ACTS writers had advocated the use of precision bombing to strike economic targets, to undermine the ability of a nation to sustain itself in war. Writing during the interwar period, the ACTS faculty was influenced by the brutality of trench warfare and the destruction during World War I. Perhaps by using strategic bombers that could hit and destroy specific targets, the nation could avoid another replay of a World War I type of conflict. Although ACTS writers also contended with issues concerning service independence and the tactical use of air power, the long-range, heavy bomber rose to prominence as a means of influencing events in a strategic manner. Army Air Corps bombers would selectively attack targets like transportation, steel plants, ball-bearing manufacturing, food sources, energy supplies, and especially, electrical production facilities. 
12
Warden shared some of the ideas from the ACTS faculty. A common theme was the attack on targets using an indirect approach. Warden and ACTS concentrated on subduing an enemy through a particular center of gravity. Striking economic targets was the primary focus of the ACTS concepts. Warden used a series of targets to affect the will of national leadership. The ACTS approach of assaulting enemy targets by strategic bombardment alone created doubt in many minds throughout the 1930s and into World War II. Warden advocated the use of air power too, but also recognized the value of other military instruments.
To Warden, air power offered many characteristics that could hasten the downfall of an adversary, especially if it were susceptible to his Five Ring model. Air power offered a number of characteristics that could serve a nation. Aircraft, by their very nature, could provide a very fast, long-range and flexible tool for commanders. 
13
Air power allows a nation to conduct parallel attacks, since air power transcends geography. Aircraft can simply fly over enemy fielded forces and avoid marching through an enemy. Like other military forces, air power can mass against particular targets and is flexible enough to change targeting within minutes. The advent of stealth aircraft, improved battle management systems, precision guided munitions, instant information, and the growing capacity to integrate and use a combination of joint forces in combat operations simply enhanced this capability. Attacking in a parallel manner allows a nation to place demands on the enemy that can overwhelm an enemy's defenses. These missions create confusion and doubt for the enemy's leadership. Military forceair power, especially-can operate on several levels: strategic, operational, or tactical. Although these attacks could deal a direct blow against a foe, Warden recommended concentrated effort aimed squarely at a specific end-coercing the leadership to change its behavior.
For Warden, the destruction of key targets had secondary importance to the effects such destruction would have on the adversary's leadership. Since the United States can achieve almost unfettered air superiority and can deliver munitions accurately, the use of air power seemed logical. Countries around the globe did not have the capacity to challenge the ability of the United States to conduct air and space operations. Although Warden developed many of his ideas while the Soviet Union was a viable nation, his ideas about air power may have taken on more credence after 1991, when his concepts were tested in Desert Storm. In some respects, the focus on measuring the impact on a function instead of the physical destruction of a target forced a change in the way commanders viewed combat operations.
Effects-based operations became a key concern. Assessing particular targets for their impact on a larger scheme is not new. During the Combined Bomber Offensive in World War II, AAF pilots attacked ball-bearing plants to stop the manufacture of German industrial and military products. American officers believed that ball bearings were a crucial center of gravity in German industrial production. Reducing ball-bearing production would severely affect engine production that could limit aircraft and tank inventories. Unfortunately, German industrial production in some cases did not cease, but actually increased. For example, BMW 801 aero-engines manufacture jumped from 5,540 motors in 1943 to 7,395 units in 1944.

What has changed since World War II is vast improvements in technology that allow one to strike and make pre-and post-attack assessments against targets in a more effective and efficient manner than in the past. Could advances in aviation and other support systems today identify, find, and destroy targets that could cripple an economy or national leadership decisively? The dream of ending the war-making capability of an enemy, much like the hopes of AAF officers during the Combined Bomber Offensive during World War II, might come to fruition with these advances. Effects-based operations require a commander to predict accurately the impact of the destruction of specific targets and their eventual influence on an adversary. Economic activities today are even more complex than those in World War II. Suppose a country wanted to disable an economy. What targets should the nation bomb? With complexity and increased specialization from globalization, this task might actually be easier today than in the past. Many nations today require outside resources and components to take advantage of global markets and comparative advantages in prices, wages, and capital. Weakening key transportation nodes, energy sources, or assembly plants that focus on a few industries might shock a nation's economy. Especially in countries that have found their niche in the world economy due to globalization, John Warden's concepts might still work. However, issues still abound. Does the nation have alternative sources of products and services that can substitute for the target? Due to specialization of industrial products, would attacks on the economy create hardship on allies who trade with or produce products within the targeted areas? What amount of collateral damage will result from these actions? Suppose a country wanted to disable an economy, what targets should the nation bomb? Reducing electricity could force a slowdown in industrial production, but this could affect hospitals and other services that cause innocent lives to be lost. What if the country has few, if any, visible targets, like nonstate actors?
Warden's theory assumes that air power has almost unlimited access to attack enemy targets. To gain maximum efficiency and effectiveness, a nation must have the ability to gain air superiority. Warden takes great pains to ensure readers understand that air superiority is a "necessity" that allows air forces to conduct operations and allows them to conduct attacks on the centers of gravity that he believes would cripple a foe. 
17
Timing is also a concern. Warden assumed that a country's air force could strike the enemy at the onset of any hostilities. 
18
Warden's ideas were tested in 1990-1991. During Operation DESERT STORM, the United States executed a strategic air campaign plan that reflected much of Warden's theory. The uncontested use of American air power resulted in an asymmetric advantage over the Iraqi forces that pit U.S. and coalition strength against Iraqi weakness. Iraq could not prevent the U.S.-led coalition from gaining air superiority. Strategic bombers, land-based tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, naval aviation, and multinational partners contributed to a massive attack on Iraq.
During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, John Warden served in the Pentagon in the Air Staff's directorate of plans where he was deputy director for warfighting concepts. This position allowed him to experiment with many creative concepts of air power employment. During the opening days of the August 1990 during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), initiated planning activities that ranged from stopping a possible invasion of Saudi Arabia to immediately pushing Iraqi forces back into their own country. One area that Schwarzkopf found lacking in CENTCOM was the ability to conduct a strategic air campaign. 
19
Warden proposed a number of approaches within the Air Staff. His final concept was presented as an Iraqi air campaign entitled Operation INSTANT THUNDER. The intent of INSTANT THUNDER was to conduct a very short, 6-day, intensive bombardment that would "incapacitate" the Iraqi leadership and destroy vital Iraqi military capability. It would not touch "basic" infrastructure that would create undue civilian hardship. 
20
The Five Ring model capitalized on the strength of American air power. The United States could launch such an attack immediately as ground forces were building up in Saudi Arabia. If Schwarzkopf conducted the campaign as written, Warden predicted it would minimize United States and allied losses and could reduce Iraqi civilian casualties and collateral damage. This campaign, more importantly, could eliminate Iraqi military capability for an extended period.
Warden developed a set of specific targets that closely resembled his model. The first targets were designed to gain air superiority by destroying air defenses, airfields, and the Iraqi air force. After the coalition achieved air superiority, its air forces would concentrate on leadership, command and control, key internal production and distribution centers, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) production and storage facilities, and offensive air and ballistic missile capability. Warden did not include Iraqi fielded land power in the INSTANT THUNDER proposal. Instead, Warden proposed to incapacitate the Hussein regime and tie up its telecommunications, civil and military, in an effort to reduce national leadership effectiveness. The organic essentials ring had several potential targets to include electricity and petroleum and oil distribution and storage for domestic Iraqi use. Warden did not want to destroy the export capacity or damage Iraqi's long-term economic health. Aircraft would attack infrastructure targets that involved railroads and some bridges. Air forces would also use psychological warfare against the Iraqi population, foreign workers, and any forces in Kuwait to reduce Saddam Hussein and his Ba'ath Party's influence. The elements of the last ring-fielded military forces-which Warden addressed, were strategic air defenses and delivery systems like bombers and ballistic missiles that could use WMD or conduct strategic operations. The attacks would occur in parallel across all five rings from strategic air defenses to Saddam Hussein's palaces.
The key center of gravity was Saddam Hussein's ability to lead and control his nation. 
21
CENTCOM campaign planners modified Warden's original six-day INSTANT THUNDER campaign plan. Warden had used the idea of a six-day campaign as a device to sell the concept to Schwarzkopf. 
22
John Warden focused his ideas on getting commanders to consider attacking the enemy by measuring the impact of those strikes on the enemy's ability to wage war. His Five Ring model gave campaign planners the ability to focus on a framework to paralyze a foe. Warden linked his ring attack to a plausible scheme against a modern nation-state. The advent of advanced munitions and delivery systems created conditions in which these types of attacks might achieve what earlier air power theorists could only dream about.
Warden's ideas led to greater reflection among air power advocates not only on the planning and actual attack on targets, but also on the more complex factor of the effect of an attack on the enemy. Commanders needed to consider not only the primary, but also the secondary and tertiary effects on the destruction or temporary disruption of these targets. Commanders through the ages have planned campaigns to meet objectives that require a study of the effects and assessment of target destruction. The advent of greater precision, speed, and lethality has allowed unprecedented opportunities to strike targets that can cripple a nation. Calls to limit damage and reduce human suffering have forced commanders to operate under increased constraints as they seek ways to accomplish their aims. Careful consideration of targets becomes a prime concern. Additionally, the ability to conduct parallel attacks forces commanders to consider how to paralyze a foe arrayed as a network or a complex of indistinct relationships. All these considerations need detailed study as commanders plan operations.
In the future, can national and military leadership gather and analyze sufficient information to implement Warden's concepts on the battlefield? Adaptive foes, lack of understanding about complex economic relationships, and other factors can limit the ability of militaries to conduct set-piece operations. Adversaries who gather information and disseminate it quickly via the Internet or cell phones can thwart efforts to conduct parallel attack schemes even if the strikes occur almost simultaneously and are separated by vast distances. Technologies that enable air and space operations to make John Warden's ideas come true are also available for an enemy to exploit as he develops countermeasures. Similarly, foes who do not operate or react like a nation-state or mirror how this country might respond could make Warden's theories difficult to implement. Still, the focus on what factors make an enemy operate as a system is a valuable way to think about an adversary. Military commanders might not overlook targets or weaknesses that they could now exploit. Warden helped integrate technology and strategic concepts that supported a major change in how nations use air power in war.
NAVAL THEORY FOR SOLDIERS J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr. soldiers do not always know much about and often do not appreciate their seagoing counterparts in the Navy. For most of a typical career, that matters not at all, but once a soldier enters the strategic realm, understanding how sailors think about their environment and conducting operations in it becomes critical. One cannot understand naval strategy without understanding the sea. Sailors design naval strategy in harmony with their understanding of the sea and naval warfare. While this is certainly also true of strategy on land-soldiers design strategies in accord with their understanding of their environment and land combat-the differences in the mediums complicate mutual understanding. Soldiers and sailors think about their environments in fundamentally different ways, and that influences how they think about strategy. Thus, this paper will begin by examining how people have classically conceptualized the sea. Then it will discuss oceans as theaters of war and the general characteristics of navies. It concludes by examining classic naval strategic theories.
The sea is a vast expanse of water. That incredibly obvious, even simplistic, statement is central to understanding how sailors think about their craft. The sea is a hostile and unforgiving environment, perhaps better suited to inspiring poets and artists than for other human activities. One does not hear sailors referring to the sea as their "friend"-they may love and respect the sea, but they approach it warily. Man needs specialized technologies just to exist at sea. Thus, people may live at sea for relatively long periods, but they almost always return to land. For mankind the sea is primarily an economic or communications medium.
In economic terms, the sea is a tremendous source of raw materials. Commercial fishing comes immediately to mind. Fishing vessels ranging from fairly small, individually owned, shrimp boats to enormous, corporately managed factory ships scour the oceans daily. In 2005, the world's catch of fish and crustaceans was estimated at 93 ¼ million metric tons plus another 1 ¹⁄ ³ million metric tons of aquatic plants (seaweed).

Besides being a workplace, but equally significant in economic terms, the sea is a line of communications. It is a way to move people and goods cheaply from one place man lives to another. Since man learned to construct boats, he has used them in this manner. It was the sea as a line of communications that made such diverse phenomena as intercontinental commerce, immigration, and colonialism possible. Although the modern commercial airline industry has a near-monopoly on the intercontinental transportation of people, shipment by sea is still by far the most economical way to move bulk goods. One source estimated the total global maritime shipping tonnage for 2004 as 6.76 billion tons and total maritime activity as an astonishing 27,635 billion ton-miles. The same source gave the world's merchant fleet at 895.8 million deadweight tons in 2004.

If politically the world's seas are mainly of economic significance (overlooking the environmental aspects for the moment), what are the implications for strategy? In other words, how does conceptualizing the sea in economic terms influence or shape how statesmen use the sea or seaborne assets to achieve political objectives? The answer is obvious-at the strategic level, maritime warfare is primarily economic. Strategically, one fights war at sea to deny the enemy the economic advantages of the sea (sources of resources or lines of communication) and/or to secure those advantages for oneself. That analysis, while true, deserves one caveat about another important aspect of modern naval power. Nuclear-armed (as opposed to nuclear-powered) navies, and to some extent conventional navies, can deter based on their inherent power to inflict pain-a capability unconnected with the economic aspects of the sea. The deterrent utility of navies is enhanced by characteristics of the sea-like the difficulty of locating individual ships, especially submarines, because of the size and composition of the medium. However, because deterrence is a concept theoretically unrelated to medium or means, the fact that naval assets can do it is useful, interesting, and irrelevant to issues of general strategic naval theory. People interested in the theory behind sea-based nuclear weapons consult Schelling rather than Mahan or Corbett. Since we are interested in naval theory rather than deterrence theory, this essay will recognize the importance of, but dismiss discussion about, the strategic deterrent aspects of the Navy.
While most of the issues about the sea as a theater of war are arguably tactical in both nature and impact, they nonetheless influence how naval theorists and practitioners see the world. Every theory or strategy must consider and reflect the environment for which it is designed. In naval warfare the nature of the sea itself is the major environmental consideration. The sea is a vast and empty space. This has several implications for naval operations. First, identification of the players is fairly straightforward. In the modern world, friendly military ships and aircraft carry electronics that identify them and communications equipment to facilitate the exchange of information and data. They also look radically different from standard civilian vessels. Additionally, civilian ships over 300 tons are required to carry electronic identification systems so they can be identified and tracked; civilian commercial aircraft also carry transponders that show a flight number, airspeed, altitude, and destination when queried by radar. Even navigational aids like buoys and potential obstacles to navigation like offshore platforms carry radar beacons that function like transponders.
All these features were instituted for other purposes, but simplify identification of friend and foe (IFF) in the military sense. Of course, one might spoof the IFF system, turn off transponders or identification equipment, exploit stealth technology, or undertake other means to hide in the environment, but in general identifying the players at sea is much easier than on land.
If identifying the players at sea is generally easy, finding them has historically been a challenge. Unlike on land where road and/or rail networks tend to dictate possible lines of operation, a navy can go just about anywhere it wants using any of a multitude of possible routes. This was less true in the ancient world, where fleets had to at least touch shorelines frequently, and in the early age of steam, when the location of coaling stations tended to dramatically restrict options for naval lines of operation. But throughout the classic age of sail and since the introduction of diesel and nuclear power, fleets could and can use the entire ocean. Combining this fact with the enormous size of the earth's oceans, compared with the tiny size of vessels and the vagaries of weather, meant finding an enemy was problematic. Battles took place when both sides sought them or when operational necessities (like being tied to a convoy, nearing final destination, etc.) simplified the location problem.
However, the ability to hide at sea was totally dependent on the vastness of the environment, and as technology expanded situational awareness, that ability has dramatically decreased. Overhead and space-based systems have extended "vision" immensely. There are still occasional blank spots where surveillance is sporadic or uneconomical and a wily sailor might hide, but unless close to shore where vessels are vulnerable to other forms of detection, those surveillance voids are generally distant from anything of strategic importance. Surface clutter (unwanted surface echoes) can provide extremely small craft like Zodiacs concealment from distant detection by radar, but such vessels are still observable by the naked eye long before they can close to a distance where they might do damage. The USS Cole was attacked by two men in a small boat loaded with explosives while moored at a refueling point in Aden harbor in October 2000. Its lookouts carried unloaded weapons and had strictly defensive-fire only if fired on-rules of engagement.

To some extent because of the relative ease of IFF, but also based on independent factors related to the character of the naval environment, collateral damage at sea is generally a negligible risk. There are significantly fewer non-combatants at sea than on the world's land surfaces-unless, of course one happens to be in one of the world's congested maritime areas, and even there the numbers involved are low compared with typical modern ground combat environments. More importantly, virtually all the civilians at sea are contained on or inside easily recognizable vessels or aircraft. Civilian aircraft are usually readily identifiable and on well known, predetermined flight paths. Civilian commercial ships are also easily identifiable as such, with only a few military logistic and medical ships even remotely resembling a commercial vessel. Commercial maritime traffic, like its air counterpart, largely follows well-known trade routes, and choke points like the two great canals and the Straits of Malacca can become crowded; but, at its worst, maritime traffic still never approaches the density of automobile traffic around even a small urban center. Civilian cruise ships and other pleasure vessels, while they ply non-standard routes, are even more distinctive in shape and style. Civilian submersibles are exceedingly rare and would be difficult to confuse with a military submarine. People can make mistakes that result in tragic loss of innocent life-as when the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian air bus in July 1988-but such incidents at sea are remarkable, specifically because they are so rare. 
9
A primary characteristic of the sea as a theater of war is that it includes two distinct liquid media and their intersection. One might say the same of land; however, because the earth is a solid medium, and movement through it is at least extremely difficult, the vast majority of land warfare occurs on the surface or within the first few feet of the surface even in complex urban terrain. The use of caves, mining, and other subsurface activity is uncommon enough to be exceptional. For thousands of years the same might have been said about the sea-only more so. All naval activity took place exclusively on the surface. However, the advent of the airplane and the submarine changed that. Now, naval warfare is truly three dimensional, while land warfare has become two dimensional. Second, the intersection of the media differs. Because water is liquid, the sea surface is essentially flat. Of course, one can argue that waves or man-made structures like oil platforms make the sea a highly textured surface, but that is at a micro level, which in no way compares in size, extent, or durability to the natural and man-made texture of the earth's land masses. Similarly, the phenomena of evaporative ducting, in which variable humidity near the surface distorts radar waves and can give false readings or readings at incorrect distances, is a pesky tactical issue, and one sailors know how to manage. 
10
The flat nature of the sea's surface has an impact on the medium as a theater of war. Visibility is limited by light or weather but not by obstacles to the line of sight as in land combat-the horizon is the only limiting factor in daytime and good weather at sea. Thus, for centuries detection of hostile forces at sea occurred long before engagement, and to hide, naval forces had to be over the horizon (six to ten miles away from a typical ship) from their opponent, use some fortuitous weather phenomenon like a fog bank or squall, or lurk behind the occasional island. Navies worked hard to increase effective engagement ranges and closing speeds. Modern technology and the ability to exploit air and subsurface media have fundamentally changed the nature of the problem. Modern navies are not surface entities-they are three dimensional. The horizon is no longer a constraint to either acquisition or engagement. In fact, a modern naval battle between world-class fleets would occur over hundreds of square miles of ocean, with the main-surface combatants almost certainly unable to physically see one another.
While distances in modern naval war might be enormous, the number of combatants is relatively small. The Naval Vessel Register lists 249 active commissioned U.S. Navy warships with a "battle force" that includes combat logistics ships of 283.

Even in a huge modern naval battle between equivalent main battle fleets, one can identify and count all the participants. The number of aircraft (manned and unmanned) and missiles, which would easily be the largest numerical category of participants, is still a manageable figure. Given computers, one can reasonably hope to find, identify, track, and ultimately target and engage all the opponent's vessels and aircraft while simultaneously tracking and controlling all friendly assets. That is decidedly different than in land warfare, where we are only now reaching a stage where we can reliably identify and track friendly forces, and that is still at the combat vehicle degree of fidelity (not individual soldiers or small units), except in extraordinary cases with very small units. One can see why network-centric warfare appeals more to sailors, who would instinctively be amenable to the concept, than soldiers, who would tend to be more skeptical about its practicality.
Similarly, because navies are such technological, machine-based organizations and, because of the nature of their environment, tactical problems at sea differ significantly from their land counterparts. The most thorny naval tactical problems often lend themselves to technological solutions. Soldiers will be familiar with the technological measure-countermeasure struggle between armor and anti-armor systems. Take that kind of paradigm and impose it on the entire fleet in all its dimensions. Sailors do not worry about adapting tactical maneuver to the enemy and terrain the way soldiers do. Even classic tactical ploys like attacking out of the sun do not make any difference if we are talking about firing a smart, medium-range, air-to-air, active radar homing missile at a target beyond visual range.

Finally, unlike war on land where a commander can force combat, battle at sea does not have to happen. Naval theorists have pointed out correctly that both sides must agree to fight at sea. In Julian Corbett's words, "In naval warfare we have a far-reaching fact which is entirely unknown on land. It is simply this-that it is possible for your enemy to remove his fleet from the board altogether. He may withdraw it into a defended port, where it is absolutely out of your reach without an army." 
15
The general characteristics of navies also influences how sailors think about maritime strategy. First, all navies are machine dependent. The ship is not simply a combat vehicle analogous to a big tank-it is essential to life at sea. A warship is a combination home, means of transportation, and combat platform. As a result, navies are now and have always been very technologically dependent; the best of them have been technologically proficient. A study of naval technology reminds one of how seemingly minor technological changes can have significant operational impact.
Certainly a product of the technological aspects of the job (skill requires long-term familiarity, practice, and study), but also reflecting the realities of life at sea, navies are almost exclusively professional in a way that has not been true of large armies since the French Revolution. The concept of a large, modern naval militia is untenable. While the Athenians might have been able to fill their triremes with citizen rowers for individual campaigns, modern navies are manned by long-service professional sailors. The belligerents in World War II drafted large navies, but they became effective only as they matured and became essentially professional sailors. The U.S. Navy Reserve today makes up only about 20 percent of the total Navy, and although it recruits directly from civilian life, many if not most of its sailors served previously in the active Navy. 
16
Navies have historically performed a fairly consistent set of missions. These have traditionally been sea control, forward presence, blockade of enemy ports/coasts, coastal defense, commerce raiding, transportation and landing of ground forces, and maritime security actions like counterpiracy. The nuclear armed navy adds strategic nuclear deterrence to that list, and the modern navy has the engagement range and capability to strike targets ashore, either independently or in support of other operations. The modern U.S. Navy organizes those tasks under broad general headings and adds non-traditional tasks like humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, but those general categories still form the heart of any navy's mission. With the exception of deterrence, strike, and transporting and landing ground forces, all of those missions are at base economic in that their intended effect is to either facilitate or hinder trade directly or indirectly. That is understandable based on what we have said about the economic character of the sea, and is exactly in-line with what maritime strategists have traditionally theorized.
The first original American military strategic theorist and the first famous maritime theorist was Alfred T. Mahan (1840-1914). An unlikely candidate for a theorist, Mahan's early career had been mediocre at best. He was rescued from obscurity by Stephen B. Luce, the self-taught, intellectual father of the U.S. Naval War College, who became the driving force behind military education in the Navy. In 1884, Luce invited Mahan to be the chair of military history and tactics at the new college, probably on the strength of The Navy in the Civil War, The Gulf and Island Waters-a forgettable volume that Mahan had just published.

Using an historical approach, Mahan sought to expose "…the effect of sea power upon the course of history and the prosperity of nations." Further, he intended to demonstrate how dominating the sea had been the primary military factor that allowed Britain to dominate the world during the period he studied. 
20

22
Mahan had distinct ideas about how naval warfare should be conducted. Although he modified his most extreme positions over time-for example, he admitted direct protection of ports and convoys and even commerce raiding might be appropriate in some circumstances-he has come to represent one school of thought in naval strategy. The school for which Mahan is the standard bearer believes the purpose of a navy is to fight the enemy navy in decisive engagements, the object of which is to gain command of the sea-that is, to establish such a dominant military position at sea that an opponent is incapable of effectively interfering with friendly operations.
Mahan's theory reflects the influence of Jomini, but he is more than Jomini at sea. Mahan believed that wars could be won by choking the opponent's maritime economic activity. To do that, one needed to defend one's sea lines of communication and threaten the enemy's. He believed the best way to protect sea lanes and economic activity at sea was by gaining command of the sea. The only certain way to secure command of the sea was by eliminating the enemy's fleet, and the best approach to that was by defeating the enemy's navy in a decisive battle or series of battles. Given that goal, as Jomini had advocated on land, Mahan advocated concentrating the fleet for the decisive naval battle. As long as the enemy's navy survived, it could contest use of the sea; when it was gone, friendly commercial activity could proceed, while the enemy's was stopped completely. Thus, defeating the enemy fleet to gain command of the sea was the overriding mission for the navy. Activities that detracted from concentration for the main fleet action were superfluous. There would be no need to protect merchant shipping directly or guard ports if the enemy's navy lay at the bottom of the sea. Trying to bypass the enemy's fleet and directly attack the commerce that was, after all, the ultimate objective, was total folly. 
23
24
This line of reasoning flew in the face of traditional U.S. naval policy that-after 1814, when the nation was secure under the umbrella of Great Britain's command of the sea-had relied on small fleets and land fortifications for coastal defense, counter-piracy operations for merchant protection, and commerce raiding (especially in the case of the Confederacy) and blockade for offensive operations. Instead of that traditional small navy defensive policy, Mahan asserted that prosperity would result from developing a first-class fleet, acquiring the necessary coaling stations for worldwide deployment, and becoming a major maritime power capable of contesting control of the sea with the other major maritime powers. Mahan was an imperialist and wanted to position the U.S. to be an imperial power.
Mahan lived through a period of rapid and dramatic change in naval technology and warfare; he based his theory on the historical examination of the age of sail. His theories generated debate during their day, and to some extent, did not stand up well to changing political and technological times. For example he did not foresee the burst of anti-colonialism that would change forever the political structure he envisioned, nor the advent of effective aircraft and submarines that would do the same for naval tactics. Perhaps more damning, he overestimated the economic significance of sea power-most national economies, perhaps excluding island nations like Britain or Japan, do not depend on seaborne commerce to nearly the extent Mahan believed. At least by the early-20th century, domestic industrial capacity was far more significant to most countries than overseas colonies and trade. Additionally, as the geo-strategist, Halford MacKinder, noted, even as Mahan wrote the railroad was opening up the vast interiors of the continents in a way never before seen and was challenging sea-and river-borne transport as the cheapest and easiest way to move bulk goods over great distances. 
25
The British maritime theorist Julian Corbett (1854-1922) was a contemporary of Mahan's. Like his American counterpart, Corbett was an unlikely naval theorist-in Corbett's case, because he had never served in the navy. Trained in law at Cambridge, Corbett disliked the legal profession and turned instead to a life as a writer. Several unsuccessful novels preceded his publication of popular biographies of the British admirals Monk and Drake. Those gave him the credentials and interest to join the newly formed Naval Records Society in 1893. His career as a naval commentator and theorist really began when the society asked him to edit some of the papers it was publishing. Corbett published volumes on Fighting Instructions, 1530-1816 and Signals and Instructions, 1776-1794, which offered reinterpretations of naval warfare during those periods. He followed those with a series of books on British naval operations from Drake to Nelson that developed his controversial interpretation of sea power and naval history. Shortly after the turn of the century Corbett's reputation was such that he became the admiralty's chief unofficial strategic advisor. He was a strong supporter of Admiral Jackie Fisher's reforms as Second and later First Sea Lord. In 1911, Corbett published Some Principles of Maritime Strategy, which consolidated his thoughts and made them available to the general public.

It [another reason for the strength of limited war] is that limited war permits the use of the defensive without its usual drawbacks to a degree that is impossible in unlimited war. These drawbacks are chiefly that it tends to surrender the initiative to the enemy and that it deprives us of the moral exhilaration of the offensive. But in limited war, as we, shall see, this need not be the case, and if without making these sacrifices we are able to act mainly on the defensive our position becomes exceedingly strong. 
33
34
Unlike Mahan or Corbett, Admiral J. C. Wylie (1911-1993) was a likely candidate for a military theorist. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1932 and had a series of typical developmental assignments in the surface fleet through World War II. After the war, he had assignments in the Office of Naval Research and as both a student and on the staff at the Naval War College, as well as progressively responsible command and staff assignments at sea, before retiring in 1972.

Wylie's work, although targeted broadly, became most influential in naval circles. Its meld of Mahan and Clausewitz makes it particularly attractive to modern sailors, and its recognition of the role of naval forces in overall national strategy makes it useful for all national security professionals. Both groups could benefit from reading Wylie's thoughts on grand strategy.
Mahan and Corbett (and to some extent Wylie) proposed strategic theory most suitable for large naval powers, yet most of the world's nations do not fit in that category. What is the small or midsized maritime nation to do if it gets involved in a war with the big boys? For example, how should France of Germany compete with Great Britain at sea? Since preemptive surrender is always an option, the smaller naval power may simply concede command of the sea with all its benefits to the large power and contest the issue strictly on land. That, however, is not the way it usually works, as a cursory look at the history of warfare between our example countries shows. There are other theoretical approaches for the small or midsized maritime powers to consider.
If Corbett was right and command of the sea is rare, then the weaker naval power has some options. One reason he may be a weaker maritime power than his adversary is that he depends less on the sea than does the adversary. Thus, while one might not be able to exploit the sea for his own benefit, denying its use to the enemy might be of disproportionate advantage. In modern terms, while one may not be able to adopt a sea control strategy, a sea denial strategy may still be appropriate. It follows that even if one cannot win the great naval battle to gain command of the sea, there are still useful missions for a navy. A well known, and often misunderstood, example of such a mission is the fleet in being. The theory behind the concept of a fleet in being is that a naval force can exert strategic influence on an opponent simply by existing. It need not leave port, and should not if there is a danger of its being caught and destroyed. A fleet's simple presence makes the enemy expend resources and allocate forces to watch or contain it. A fleet in being at least severely limits, if it does not eliminate, opposition merchant traffic in its immediate vicinity and those waters within its ready reach. Both strategically and ethically, a fleet in being is almost always a better, if less glorious, choice than a sortie against impossible odds. It may threaten a local coalition partner of its opponent even if it cannot beat the main opponent, but there again, the threat would be limited to cases in which it could isolate the ally, beat it, and escape the inevitable intervention of the stronger navy. Whatever its other possibilities, the strategist must remember that the fleet in being concept is mainly designed to deny or divert.
Other naval strategies can potentially achieve positive results for the underdog maritime power. The most common of these historically is probably the resort to guerre de course, or commerce raiding. That approach targets directly what is important about the sea-merchant traffic. If the sea is an economic commons, intercepting the opponent's seagoing commerce is a worthwhile enterprise. If one cannot win the great naval battle to gain command of the seas, then guerre de course allows you to skip that step and go straight for the ultimate objective of sweeping enemy commerce from the oceans. Hopefully, sinking enough commerce will cripple the enemy economy and produce surrender or political compromise; at a minimum, high risk of commercial loss at sea raises insurance rates and diverts warships from other duties. Through the 19th-century national navies conducted guerre de course in conjunction with licensed private vessels called privateers-a polite name for government-sanctioned pirates. The international community banned privateering in 1856, and the advent shortly thereafter of effective submarines fundamentally changed the conduct of guerre de course. 
40
Perhaps the most comprehensive approach to naval strategy for the underdog was a littleknown 19th-century French school of strategic thought called the Jeune École (New School, or Young School), which combined a concept to address the issue of sea control with guerre de course. Even though France was a major naval power with significant maritime interests, it had always had difficulty competing effectively with British sea power. The development of torpedoes and large-caliber, flat-trajectory naval cannons seemed to argue for a different technological paradigm than the traditional navy. The Jeune École advocated numerous smaller, faster vessels armed with the new weaponry (100-foot-long torpedo boats and cruisers) as the technological counter to the battleship. For a period during the 1880s, battleship construction (even in Britain) almost stopped.
The French Minister of Marine, Admiral Théophile Aube, one of the sponsors of the Jeune École, in 1886 cancelled all French battleship construction and shifted funding into torpedo boats and cruisers. The Jeune École claimed that steam power and the new weapons combined to negate the ability of navies to do their traditional missions-battleship navies could not win command of the sea against an opponent armed with the new technology, and neither could they protect maritime commerce directly, since the volume was presumed to be too large to escort. Thus, command of the sea was meaningless. Instead, guerre de course by the same torpedo boats that doomed the battleships could inflict enormous economic penalties on powers like Britain that relied too heavily on maritime commerce. Technological problems with the torpedo boats, the development of the destroyer, and the publication of Mahan's Influences of Sea Power Upon History doomed the Jeune École concept. The 1889 British naval budget nearly doubled naval appropriations for battleships. The other powers followed suit, and the Jeune École receded into the footnotes of history. 
41
Modern naval underdogs retain all the options of their predecessors, but technology has increased and to some degree simplified those options. For example, mines of various degrees of sophistication can close or limit access to ports and waterways. These can be very cheaply and easily deployed; finding and counteracting them can be difficult, dangerous, costly, and time consuming. Huge modern container vessels and supertankers (as well as their cargos) are much too valuable to risk if even a minimal threat of mines exists, so even a poorly executed and perhaps technically ineffective harbor-or sea-lane-mining program can essentially shut down shipping until the mines have been swept and the confidence of shippers restored. This is a very attractive proposition for the underdog. It is cheap and easy enough for even a Third World country, yet potentially extremely effective.
The 21st-century U.S. Navy reflects the thinking of the classic naval theorists. As a the world's most powerful navy, it is more comfortable with Mahan and Corbett than the Jeune École; as a navy with no near peer competitor, it has the luxury of concentrating more on projecting effects ashore or even on humanitarian and disaster relief operations than on titanic naval battles between main battle fleets for the control of the sea. The U.S. Navy lists its core capabilities as forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response. 
42
The sea is still a vast expanse of water, and sailors still think about it and warfare afloat differently than soldiers think about land combat. The maritime theater will always be more transparent and susceptible to technological solutions than its land counterpart. The smaller number of combatants and the relative (as compared to the land context) ease of locating them simplifies all aspects of finding, identifying, targeting, and engaging the enemy-although one should not assume any of those problems are ever easy. The sailor will always think about war in his medium in a very logical, sensible pattern based on the characteristics of that medium. The soldier will not instinctively think about war in the same manner. Hopefully, this paper causes some soldiers to consider maritime strategic theory in a different light and produces increased understanding.
This is the definition by William Gibson from his landmark 1984 novel Neuromancer.

Consistent with current joint doctrine, cyberspace operations encompass the three dimensions of the information environment-cognition, content, and connectivity. Cognition centers on human perception, decisionmaking, and interaction in cyberspace. The proper study of it should include disciplines such as neurobiology, psychology, philosophy, and ethics. In today's broad discussion of national security, cognition is probably the least emphasized element of cyberspace. Content refers to the information that is created (and destroyed), transferred, and stored in cyberspace. It can take many forms, the vast majority of which currently involve digital representations transmitted via electronic means. It is probably the most emphasized element of cyberspace, with much focus on software programs that can create or destroy data at many levels. Connectivity represents the physical platforms and structures that facilitate the cognitive and content dimensions in cyberspace. It is the most visible dimension (e.g., personal computers [PCs], mobile devices, and cell towers) and thus probably the easiest for the average citizen to comprehend. As one might imagine, the boundaries between these dimensions are not discrete and inflexible but often overlap (e.g., consider social networking).
One can argue that most military professionals are comfortable with the concept of operational domains-land, sea, air, and space-and thus often look for cyberspace to be a logical extension or expansion of such familiar concepts. (Interestingly, there is no DoD joint definition for "domain.") In fact, the first strategic initiative of the 2011 DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace is to "treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential."

To illustrate this concept of domain in a larger commons better, consider Figure

As the development of cyberspace theory progresses, it should encompass all possible activities in cyberspace. The following is an attempt to identify some of the characteristics of such activities that are of high interest in today's security environment.
Cyberspace enables the simultaneous manifestation of many planes of existence-some physical, some virtual, some a combination of the two. The term "virtual" usually refers to a computeraided representation to simulate actual presence in the physical world. However, the concept of virtual reality has gone far beyond mere mimicry. For example, a single individual may have multiple personas in cyberspace. Conversely, a distributed group of individuals may collectively form a single persona. The virtual environment in which these personas reside may have no analog in the real world. Manipulating these embodiments may increase individual and group freedom to maneuver at various levels in cyberspace and presents challenges to others attempting to attribute specific activities to specific physical individuals.
Progressing through history, traditional domains required the use of technology to achieve access-carts on land, ships at sea, aircraft in the sky, and satellites in space. One could argue that such access did not create any new portion of the domain, nor significantly change the structure of domain itself. Cyberspace may be unique in that access and creation are almost synonymous or at least simultaneous-that is, the technology used to access cyberspace (e.g., computers and mobile devices) becomes an inherent part of the domain itself. Certainly, the growth of modern cyberspace from the infancy period of the ARPANET, with fewer than a dozen nodes of connectiv-ity to the current Internet of more than six billion connected devices, demonstrates this concept. One should ponder if this will remain a constant relationship of creation nearly matching access, or if the balance will shift in the future until cyberspace becomes almost like the natural domains, and emphasis will be on access vice creation.
There has been much debate among cybersecurity experts regarding the ability to perfect defenses, encryption, and secure access in cyberspace. However, these debates often dive into the mundane, such as the speculated capabilities of organizations to "crack" passwords and thus ignore what the author posits as an axiom of cyberspace. That is, if a developer or user employs a device to connect to the cyberspace commons, then the whole of the commons can connect to that device. One must consider this a fundamental truth for the operator, since it defines the realm of the possible.
Thus, it is impossible to open a perfect one-way portal into cyberspace. This presents scenarios that may be unsettling to the uninformed. For example, all users of cyberspace must accept the fact that any messages or images they send or access over cyberspace can be viewed by anyone in cyberspace. Granted, such access may require illegal or unethical activity, but this does not change the fact that the action is in the realm of the possible.
With this in mind, cyberspace security cannot build a foolproof system, and thus should fall back on traditional risk management paradigms to design and prioritize security measures that punish potential adversaries with extreme costs for any benefits they may derive. In theory, this implies that anyone entering cyberspace to conduct attack operations can have these operations attributed to their point of origin.
Achieving deliberate and conscious access to cyberspace continues to become simpler for the average citizen, but so does the access that is unconscious and perhaps unwelcome. The ubiquitous presence of cyberspace-connected devices is transforming the definitions and expectations of private versus public settings. Much friction is developing between the desire for freedom of action for all individuals in cyberspace and the desire for privacy and security of those actions. One end of the spectrum is the Orwellian view of a "Big Brother" government seeking to watch all activities and usurp all personal data. A recent demonstration of that perspective involved officials at high schools in Philadelphia who turned on cameras on laptops loaned to students without their permission.

Internet-enabled communications have progressed to the point that most users consider them direct and instantaneous. This is largely an illusion derived from the shortcoming of human perception. For example, electrons traveling at the speed of light can circle the Earth in about 130 milliseconds, about one-third the time of a human eye blink. In the physical world, if one were to fire a weapon at a 10-meter target, the bullet would follow a largely predictable path, based on the gross properties of the air medium at the time (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). Interactions at the molecular level are negligible compared with the momentum of the bullet; thus, it follows a direct path and achieves kinetic effects at the point of impact. That is not how things work in cyberspace.
Coupled with typical low-cost computer processing units that can accomplish billions of floating-point operations per second, the perceived transmission of a given data packet is assumed to follow a direct path in a stable environment. In reality, the configuration of cyberspace is constantly changing, such that, one could argue at the quantum level, it may change significantly in the milliseconds it takes for the human operator to press the "Enter" key. The illusion is that the effects and path appear to be direct from a physical perspective, but in the relative framework of cyberspace operations, they are indirect, inefficient, and slow to manifest. The author posits that projecting a guaranteed path in cyberspace is currently impossible, just as it is impossible to align all the molecules of air to accommodate a passing bullet. The goal of the cyberspace operator, then, is to determine the gross properties affecting cyberspace operations (if indeed they exist) as well as how to operate in them.
For discussion purposes, kinetic operations are those that occur in the visible physical environment and can be properly described using Newtonian physics. Operations in the traditional mediums (e.g., land, sea, and air) deal largely with kinetic means seeking kinetic effects, such as artillery barrages or bomb drops. These operations can have destructive immediate effects to facilitate beneficial changes to the localized medium-for example, the use of explosives during peacetime to carve out a highway tunnel or boat canal.
Consider nonkinetic operations as dealing with the unobservable exchange of information using various means in the electromagnetic spectrum. Figure

Similar to other mediums, the active cyberspace environment has discernable structure that supports the disorderly movement of its contents. Classic thermodynamic modeling characterizes such random motion and disorder as "entropy." While some may offer cyberspace as an effective and optimized environment with little disorder, the truth is otherwise. In fact, cyberspace activity may actually be much more entropic than that of the physical world. The transmission of a data packet over the Internet may result in its division into many subpackets sent over different paths through an unknown number and type of processors and switches-this complexity may render tame by comparison the Brownian motion of air molecules colliding inside an inflated balloon.
Regardless of its relative scope of disorder when compared with the physical world, cyberspace is inherently complex and disorderly-the degree of which only increases as cyberspace continues to expand with the addition of new devices and connecting infrastructure. It is not logical to expect order to arise spontaneously out of such a cacophony, analogous to the second law of thermodynamics in the physical universe. 
12
The cyberspace entropy concept also offers a different paradigm on the concept of precision in cyberspace. One of the popular implicit promises of domain operations in cyberspace is that they will be clean, predictable, and repeatable. The author posits exactly the opposite-that operations in cyberspace are by nature not only disorderly and unpredictable, but also more difficult to characterize accurately in the realm of human cognition than traditional kinetic domain operations. This may have significant implications for the concept of precision engagement-the promise of some information technology enthusiasts is that cyberspace offers the ultimate form of achieving precision effects. The author asserts the opposite; that, in fact, achieving well-characterized and bounded effects in cyberspace is much more difficult to do than in physical space, and that the potential for unanticipated consequences is greater. Further, the means and methods used to achieve precision in cyberspace have limited utility, since their design is based on a configuration of cyberspace destined to change (by design or coincidence).
Siren Song of Certainty.
One of the most significant cautions for applications in cyberspace is to recognize that it is not a panacea for uncertainty. Implications stemming from the concepts of connectivity and entropy are that cyberspace is constantly changing in the microscopic sense-thus we will not soon resolve the vain pursuit of omniscience. The macroscopic features of cyberspace are also changing more rapidly than those of other domains, which, in operational terms, have reached a mostly steady state. The confluence of these changes may help to explain a common users' dilemma with computer activity that seems to both defy and comply with the definition of insanity attributed to Albert Einstein (i.e., doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results). Even though an operator may enter a command that fails on the first attempt, but succeeds on the second-the problem did not simply "go away"; the configuration of cyberspace changed. Thus, it may make perfect sense at the macroscopic level in cyberspace to expect different outcomes from the same input, since cyberspace at the microscopic level changes between the events.
Now that the reader has an appreciation for the need to consider a context beyond the domain concept to evaluate activity in cyberspace properly, what are some of the practical methodologies for accomplishing this? While a holistic theory for cyberspace has yet to be offered, elements of such a theory exist, some of which we examine next.
In 2009, Dr. Stuart Starr of the National Defense University published an essay entitled "Toward a Preliminary Theory of Cyberpower," which offers a worthy framework to inform the dialogue regarding the national security aspects of cyberspace. He emphasizes the need for proper theory to address five key issues: definition of terms; categorization and structure of theory elements; explanation of the elements by analysis and example; connection of the elements for comprehensive examination; and anticipation of future activities and trends. He develops a three-layer pyramid model, with cyberpower sandwiched between the base section of cyberspace and the top section of cyber strategy. The article includes timelines illustrating the evolution of cyberspace over the past 50 years, and the evolution of cyberpower (military and economic elements) and cyber strategy over the past 30 years. Spread across all three tiers are institutional factors that theory must consider; these include issues of governance, law, information exchange, and civil liberties. 
13
In March 2011, a Department of Homeland Security paper proposed the concept of a "healthy cyber ecosystem" as a model for enabling future security in cyberspace. The article offers novel approaches, such as analogies based on the human immune system and the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control methods to achieve their three foundational building blocks of automation, interoperability, and authentication. The paper states the concept vision concisely:
In this future, cyber devices have innate capabilities that enable them to work together to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences of attacks, and recover to a trusted state.

On October 31, 2010, U.S. Cyber Command achieved Full Operational Capability, with its mission to direct operations and defense of DoD networks, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations, and ensure U.S. and Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to adversaries. 
16
A focus on applying traditional competencies in a domain environment, although it may be consistent with the DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, may run the risk of greatly underestimating the complexity of activities in cyberspace. The Army posits the cyber-electromagnetic contest as the third dimension of full-spectrum operations

In a recent Survival article, W. Alexander Vacca examines in more detail how the military cultures of the Navy (applying Mahan and Corbett's concepts) and the Air Force (applying Douhet's concepts) influence their approaches to cyber security. Vacca posits the Navy approach will more likely embrace the commons model and devise cyber operations to defeat enemy cyber operations. The Air Force will more likely be aware of the influence of popular will and morale in conflict, focus more on an effects-based view of cyber operations, and embrace a model of cyber deterrence. Vacca concludes that "given the proclivity of the services to consider threats and responses through different prisms, these inefficiencies seem preferable to potential blindness, especially as the nature of the threat continues to evolve." 
20
Traditional (i.e., Mahanian) naval theory provides an analogy to illustrate the value of modeling military activities as domain operations in a greater global commons. Part of the utility of the analogy is the difference between naval operations in the littoral area-the "brown water"-versus those in the broad ocean-the "blue water." When one connects the major ports in the brown water to other ports in the world, "sea lines of communication" emerge in the blue water that have strategic importance based on many factors, including geography and volume of traffic. 
21
In a 2001 article in Naval Law Review, Lieutenant Commander Steven Barney added detail to such concepts by using the framework of the 1982 United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea to examine issues related to routing information through cyberspace. He proposed the concept of national cyberspace as "the region of Cyberspace in which individual States require substantial sovereign rights to preserve the political and economic security of the State." He divided this region into internal cyberspace, "where a State may exercise complete sovereignty," and territorial cyberspace-the "portion of national cyberspace through which, and to which, governments, commercial enterprises, or private organization allow generally unrestricted access." Barney considers international cyberspace a region with no physical analogy to international waters. Rather, he offers that it "is not a physical place; it is a characteristic of cyberspace by which a data packet is not physically present anywhere but is merely in transit."

What are some of the implications for military operations in the cyberspace domain, and how do they relate to the greater commons context? To explore this question, let us address the nine classic principles of war as well as the additional joint principles of restraint, perseverance, and legitimacy. The discussion below is illustrative vice comprehensive and, by design, provides more questions than answers. The reader may note the implicit overarching assumption among the principles that achieving decisive results is possible in warfare-this notion reflects a domainfocused view. Another overarching domain aspect of note is that the time versus physical distance at which effects are manifested via activities in cyberspace operations may be significantly more rapid than activities in the other physical domains.
The principle of objective strives "to direct every military operation toward a clearly defined, decisive, and achievable goal" with the understanding that these objectives "support attainment of the overall political goals of the conflict." 
27
Offensive.
The purpose of offensive action is "to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative . . . the most effective and decisive way to achieve a clearly defined objective" with such operations conducted "while maintaining freedom of action and achieving decisive results." Defensive actions are downplayed as "only a temporary expedient" until the offensive initiative is regained. 
28
Mass means "to concentrate the effects of combat power at the most advantageous place and time to produce decisive results." One achieves mass in part through the integration and synchronization of capabilities. 
29
30
Maneuver seeks "to place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power" using "the movement of forces in relation to the enemy to secure or retain positional advantage," usually to facilitate the delivery of "direct and indirect fires of the maneuvering force." 
31
23
Economy of force reflects "the judicious employment and distribution of forces" designed to expend minimum power on secondary effects and maximum power on the primary effect. 
32
33
34
The principle of unity of command endeavors "to ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for every objective" possessing "the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose."

Security aims "to prevent the enemy from acquiring unexpected advantage"; it implements the tenets of enhancing freedom of action while protecting friendly forces. It embraces "prudent risk management, not undue caution," 
37
The purpose of surprise is "to strike at a time or place or in a manner for which the enemy is unprepared" with hopes of shifting the balance of power to "achieve success well out of proportion to the effort expended." 
38
39
Simplicity aims "to increase the probability that plans and operations will be executed as intended by preparing clear, uncomplicated plans and concise orders" designed to "minimize misunderstanding and confusion" and address "stress, fatigue, fog of war, and complexities of modern combat." 
40
The principle of restraint attempts "to limit collateral damage and prevent the unnecessary use of force" that requires instead the "judicious use of force." 
41
Otherwise, restraint may unwillingly go by the wayside and open the door for ill-conceived notions such as "carpet bombing in cyberspace." 
42
The principle of perseverance tries "to ensure the commitment necessary to attain the national strategic end state" that may include "preparation for measured, protracted military operations." 
43
Legitimacy endeavors "to maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of operations."

The previous section examined some implications of the domain approach projected into the larger commons. The author posits that many of the activities in other domains (land, sea, and air) that led to the establishment of the principles of warfare deal with the attempts to gain local and temporal control of such domains. In contrast, cyberspace can be considered an artificial domain initially created for the purpose of exercising control or governing activities. This artificial domain requires energy to exist (e.g., use of the electromagnetic spectrum). Its control or governance can be first-order-conscious and deliberate-or various levels of nth-orders that may be unconscious, accidental, or emergent. This domain exists as part of a larger commons, both artificial and real.
However, for understanding that endures beyond our current technological manifestation of cyberspace, even the commons model is insufficient. To take a truly holistic view, one must deliberately examine the ontology of cyberspace to determine how its current form fits into its overarching evolutionary path. Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that studies the nature of existence or being; in this case, a study of the actual essence of cyberspace. As such, it is intimately connected with epistemology, which includes investigation into the nature of knowledge. A full discussion of such topics of philosophy is beyond the scope of this chapter, but we will examine several related issues for their relevance to developing cyberspace theory.
Cyberspace ontology must address many fundamental questions, some of which may be of particular importance for planning near-term cyberspace security. Is the balance of activity in cyberspace moving toward stability or instability, or perhaps dynamic stability? Will cyberspace become self-organizing and self-regulating in its function, perhaps similar to the processes in a living organism? If so, what are the implications? Will cyberspace reach a steady state of activity and scope; if so, what will be its limiting or defining factors? Can concepts such as complexity and emergence as well as convergence and divergence provide practical insight into the modeling of entropy in cyberspace? How is the cognitive dimension of the information environment changing based on the trend toward increased human-machine interface and the anticipated growth of neural prosthetics? 
46
At much deeper levels of theoretical physics, some may argue that the cyberspace ontology is but a subset of broader concepts such as "quantum reality" that strive to model the micro-to-macro structure of the universe itself. 
47
While there is much conjecture about the future of cyberspace, the author offers two concepts to consider regarding the potential role of cyberspace in human evolution. The first is the concept of "the singularity" explored in several books by futurist Ray Kurzweil as a "future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impacts so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed." Specifically, the singularity refers to the inflection point at which the collective computational capability (not intelligence) of machines exceeds that of the human population. Kurweil posits three overlapping revolutions surrounding this event-genetics, as an intersection of information and biology; nanotechnology, as an intersection of information and the physical world; and robotics, as a growth of artificial intelligence.

Hopefully, the previous section broadened the reader's scope for thinking about cyberspace, and persuaded him/her that the true nature of cyberspace is more than analytical constants to be categorized, but rather, a developing enigma to be studied. However, current matters of international security include an abundance of "here and now" issues related to cyberspace. Balancing these practical demands while evaluating the rather esoteric aspects of cyberspace are challenges that strategic leaders should take seriously.
Despite some promising developments, it is risky to consider the current application of cyberspace operations as a "silver bullet." Developing theoretical principles for cyberspace may help to explore the opportunities as well as potential shortcomings that affect such operations. In a technical sense, planners and decisionmakers need to recognize that applications may be neither precise nor free from disorder, and that the cyberspace environment in which decisions are made may be significantly different from the cyberspace environment in which they are enacted. Thus, they should conduct critical, perhaps even skeptical, reviews of promised capabilities-especially when making resourcing decisions.
Because of the complex interplay of nonkinetic and kinetic forces that result in nth-order effects that are largely unknown, leaders need to adopt a holistic approach to planning that considers effects not only to other warfighting domains, but also to other instruments of power. To support such assessments, we must develop and quantify measures of power in cyberspace to help prioritize defense methods and investment; one should expect these values to be moving targets. We must exercise prudence and wisdom in the selection of areas to implement fully automated responses (e.g., active defense), since this represents a conscious abdication of the cognitive to the content dimension. While some measures of automated defense may require fully automated responses to preserve or protect critical functions, perhaps like reflexes in a human neural system to protect one's hand from a hot stove, the indiscriminate application could potentially create more problems than it solves. 
51
It is reasonable to assert that current and future embodiments of cyberspace will follow the model of human conflict described by the Clausewitzian trinity of emotion, reason, and chance. As witnessed in the so-called "Arab Spring" events such as those in Egypt and Tunisia, social media via cyberspace provided a conduit for raw human expression to force change on the world stage. 
52
While we can evaluate certain limited aspects of operations in cyberspace using a domain model, the proper examination requires a holistic approach that includes current concepts of the commons as well as those of a conscious future-directed model that recognizes the continuing evolution of cyberspace. In addition, cyberspace theory should embrace the potential for radical emergent behavior that may shift the balance of influence among the cognition, content, and connectivity dimensions. This requires the deliberate and thoughtful pursuit of cyberspace theory as a continuing dialogue that may include multiple frameworks for analysis. This pursuit of cyberspace theory will not occur unless we adopt a formal bifurcated approach to national efforts-one that is integrated to address both the pragmatic and urgent present challenge as well as a separately resourced effort dedicated to examining the changing nature of cyberspace itself. Without such a "big picture" view, planners and decisionmakers add risk in their activities by not characterizing the full spectrum of the interactions and effects of creation and use in cyberspace. Again, for the purist, the goal of this paper was not to prescribe such a theoretical framework, but rather, to begin a dialogue toward that end.

Over the past 2 decades, many security professionals have declared cyberspace a new domain for warfare. More importantly, the ability to access and operate in cyberspace freely is considered a vital interest for the sovereignty and prosperity of the United States.

This chapter argues the need for the development and adoption of theories of cyberspace that provide the context essential for informed decisionmaking for the full spectrum of cyberspace security issues. It will not offer a codified and refined theory. Instead, this chapter introduces the reader to the concepts necessary to develop theoretical frameworks (some of which already exist in limited scope); in essence, it offers the beginning of a broader dialogue. To accomplish this, we establish fundamental nomenclature and constructs in cyberspace to avoid potential debate over semantics. Next, there is a short survey of some existing theoretical frameworks that illustrate the utility of examining activities in cyberspace in a broader perspective. A more detailed examination of applying (by analogy) established naval theory is presented. Focusing on theory for the operational level of war, we offer for consideration examples of cyberspace manifestations for the principles of joint operations that include all nine classic principles of war. Broadening the scope again, the article then addresses the ontology of cyberspace itself, which includes its possible evolutionary paths. It concludes with implications for present strategic leaders and some of the fundamental questions that should guide how the nation will shape its interface with and activities in cyberspace. The thoughtful pursuit of answers to many of these questions is left to the readers.
This section provides definitions as a baseline for evaluation of frameworks for cyberspace theory. Rather than debate the intricacies of these definitions, the domain approach is reconciled in the context of the cyberspace commons, which incorporates all instruments of national power. The section also presents key characteristics of cyberspace activities in general terms.
Currently, the Department of Defense (DoD) defines cyberspace as "a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers."
