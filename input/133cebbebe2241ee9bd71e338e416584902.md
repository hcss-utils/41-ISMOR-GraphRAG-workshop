Finally, there is the possibility of a much more radical nuclear force, one that is the main focus of U.S. military operations.
This would be a significant departure from anything the United States currently plans.
In essence, it would do something similar to what Russia says it wants to do: rely heavily on nuclear forces-strategic forces supplemented by a larger arsenal of smaller nuclear weapons designed for bat√ºefield use-to be the mainstays of U.S. combat capability.
Such an approach, while possible in principle, seems hard to justify based on the state of the world as it seems to be evolving and the effectiveness of modern conventional weapons.
At the very least, it would almost certainly end any hope of limiting nuclear proliferation.
