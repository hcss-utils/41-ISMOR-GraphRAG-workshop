Similarly to how the Russians have developed new Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) through the U.S. experience, the U.S. Army can adapt based on the lessons learned from the Russian conflicts in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine.
While the conflicts in Chechnya and Georgia may appear to be decisive victories, Russia made numerous mistakes that the U.S. Army can exploit.
It would not be prudent to assume Russia would fight against America in the same way they did in each of the above conflicts, but it is probable they would build upon their experiences.
