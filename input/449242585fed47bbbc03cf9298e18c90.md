In addition to my editors at Pluto Press, especially Roger van Zwanenberg, Robert Webb and Rebecca Wise, I would like to recognize the following people who gave me direct assistance in the writing or conception of this book, or who gave me insight, inspiration or encouragement
For a quarter century I have been teaching courses at the University of Massachusetts-Boston on American wars of the twentieth century with emphasis upon social, political and economic consequences to the United States and the even more bitter costs to those nations on the receiving end of American fi repower. Any assumptions I had initially about basic knowledge on the part of students were shattered early on. Even back in the 1980s, only a decade after the war in Vietnam ended, many students did not know whether the US had sided with the North or South. Many had no idea who Ho Chi Minh was. I encountered one student who had come to believe that the pernicious communists had employed 'Asian Orange' herbicides on American troops in an attempt to poison them. Many students, and presumably the larger public, remain unaware of what occurred at Pearl Harbor during World War II, or of what nations comprised the Axis. Nor could many name even one of the US presidents during that confl ict! More than a few believed the US had fought the communists. World War I and the Korean War are terra incognita to say nothing of the Spanish-American, Mexican and all other wars. All this in a major university! Matters seem to be getting worse.
Gore Vidal mocks the country of his birth as 'the United States of Amnesia', knowing full well that none of this is an accident. Many years ago, shortly after undergraduate studies and just as the innovative educational experiments of the 1960s were undermined by the conservative reaction, I worked as a substitute high school teacher in a Boston suburb and attempted to bring in materials outside of the prescribed curriculum to make sense of matters in the assigned text that were incomprehensible otherwise. I was told in no uncertain terms that I would teach that curriculum or I would be gone. I was shortly gone. Commercial television, pop music and Hollywood have widely replaced reading as a source of 'information' and those who control such channels ensure that the menu of choice involves very little that can explicate for viewers the world they have inherited, much less provide any analysis or discussion about what alternatives might be possible. The culture of narcissism ensures a certain kind of moral blindness to the very real crises that emerge throughout the world and the suffering these impose on victims. The internet provides some hope but there is much quackery there and studies have shown that a majority of users visit pornography, sports or betting sites in any case.
So the conundrum remains: given the function of the mass media as purveyors of consumerist propaganda, how can we inject more relevant analysis of the past into the culture in order more clearly to illuminate our present and journey therefore into a better future?
Most young people remain aghast at the attacks that took 3,000 American lives on 9/11 but have no idea that the US has killed quite literally, directly or indirectly, millions of civilians across the planet since the 1940s, let alone the body count in the national territory since 1607. When informed that their nation has troops in 140 of the 191 nations globally most students shrug. If such is the case, they seem to imply, there must be a justifi able reason, and anyway what can be done about it? To the extent that students know anything of past wars these and the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are rationalized by the usual rhetoric. If queried to answer with any detail about why the US entered any of its wars the all-too-usual answer, often punctuated by a quizzical look, is 'freedom?' or 'national security?' Despite the absolute centrality of war to the creation and evolution of the United States, the nation's public schools, and for that matter universities and colleges, do a miserable job of educating the young about these crucial matters. More to my dismay, for almost two decades I have hosted annual workshops for high school teachers and discovered that alarming ignorance about American warfare also characterizes too many charged with that instruction.
As I tried to understand this state of affairs I thought about my own grade school introduction to the past, in the shadow of World War II, and remembered the highly jingoistic mis-education about that war drummed into my head, long ago concluding that it was the sort of triumphalist version that victors always write. But at least I had essential facts upon which to build when I began to delve deeper. That is not so today. In almost all states today history is taught 'to the test', i.e. to standardized prescriptions about what great names, events and dates students need to memorize in order to pass an examination that is the pre-requisite of graduation. With few exceptions students revile their history curricula, condemning them as insufferably boring and a 'turn-off'. Students who pass such high stakes tests most often instantly forget what little of substance they have been 'taught'. The inevitable result is widespread ignorance PREFACE xiii xiv WAR AND EMPIRE and an equal aversion to any more history, or its close relatives -politics, economics and sociology. Some might say that this is really an advantage for teachers since we don't have to overcome entrenched mythologies, but the real problem is that while the details of many hyper-nationalistic legends have largely been lost to today's youth, the highly idealized belief system they were intended to buttress remains as deeply rooted as ever, according to which the American way of war is really the way of peace and the defense of liberty. The American people are essentially peace-loving and go to war only when the misdeeds of others force their hand. That is the incessant credo propagated in most of the mass media and increasingly unchallenged in academia.
Henry Giroux, an American professor driven to a Canadian university because he challenged the corporatization of the American university, has said that: Universities, in general, especially following the events of 9/11, were under assault by Christian nationalists, reactionary neoconservatives and market fundamentalists for allegedly representing the weak link in the war on terrorism. Right-wing students were encouraged to spy on the classes of progressive professors…Put differently, corporate and Pentagon money was now funding research projects and increasingly knowledge was being militarized in the service of developing weapons of destruction, surveillance and death. Couple this assault with the fact that faculty were becoming irrelevant as an oppositional force… and many simply no longer had the conviction to uphold the university as a democratic public sphere.
If colleges and universities are inexorably being drawn into the orbit of the warfare state should we really be surprised that the realities of that state's agenda should be hidden or overlaid with mendacity?
This slim volume is a modest attempt to provide a framework for young readers to understand the confusing, and perhaps disturbing, historical process in which they fi nd themselves and who wish to begin formulating an alternative interpretation of the American past by which to measure the present. Given the limits of space I make no claim to be comprehensive. That would require a volume many times this length. I've chosen the key confl icts that have shaped the American present with a view toward elucidating their causes and consequences. The study of history is not a sterile exercise wherein we implant our heads in the sands of the past. Imperfect as it is, history is the only roadmap we possess to see the landscape of the present. As a useful guide to the future we ignore its milestones at great hazard.
As I write, the United States and the world are in an economic crisis of such depth not seen since the 1930s. If we examine the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties, and the economic collapses they engendered, we encounter the same moral and financial corruption so much in evidence today, and, most perilously, the wars chosen by elites to resolve their problems and discipline the masses.
Our roadmap shows us that we've been on this treacherous terrain before; we need not repeat past tragedy by enacting cruel farce yet again. If this text accomplishes nothing else I hope it reveals that every war in the American past was at bottom a matter of choice, not, as our national ideology proclaims, a necessity. War has never made the world safe for peace but only for more war.
How many Americans have ever paused to consider that the United States has never bombed any nation that could bomb us back? Ponder the 'Good War'. Neither Germany nor Japan was remotely capable of devastating American cities during World War II, as the US assuredly desolated theirs. If they had possessed such capacity we would never have bombed them for the same reason we never bombarded the Soviets. Since neither of the Axis allies wished war with the US (for the simple reason that they didn't believe they could win), and neither could cross the ocean to attack our cities, neither constituted a genuine military threat to the US. In Chapter 7 we shall examine the real danger offi cials perceived, and how the administration of Franklin Roosevelt manipulated events such that both Germany and Japan would view America as the primary threat to their imperial aims, and therefore opt for war as their only possible insurance, thereby enabling the US to enter a war the public had decidedly not wanted. But would Roosevelt have chosen war, as he surely did, had he believed that a majority of our cities would lie in ruins? Of all belligerents the United States lost the fewest lives by far. Would decision-makers have been willing to accept civilian casualties on a scale like Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, or even London during the Blitz? The strategic goal of American elites in World War II was to expand their global power and reach, taking advantage of the ruin and decline all the other combatants would suffer, enemies and allies alike. The US waged war in such a way as to rise in the global hierarchy, not to sink, and it rose to the top.
Certainly there were American casualties in all wars but never on the scale faced by the losing side. None of this is to dishonor those who gave or risked their lives. Most believed what their offi cials told them about the threat to the nation. In all cases offi cials who opted for war believed material gains would far outweigh the loss of life since the war makers would not be risking their own, or in most cases, their kin's.
Or consider how the US approached its communist enemies of a generation ago and ask the same questions. Though the US falsely blamed both the Soviet Union and China for the wars in Korea and Vietnam, and for resistance to the US throughout the so-called 'Third World', American bombs were never unleashed on either of them, though American ordnance lay waste to Korea and Indochina. The reason is quite elementary. The communist giants had nukes and could incinerate us. We ravage only those who lie all but helpless before us.
I challenge any who disagree with the foregoing to name a single American war, with the exceptions of the Revolution and War of 1812, in neither of which Britain brought its full might to bear, where the opponent came close to matching the wealth, resources, and military power the US threw against it. Could any of the following have despoiled our own territory? Iraq? Afghanistan? Serbia? Panama? Nicaragua, Vietnam? Cambodia? Laos? Dominican Republic? Korea? Spain? The Philippines? The Sioux? The Cheyenne? Mexico? The Cherokee? Both Germany and Japan were the strongest enemies the US ever faced in battle, but let us note whose cities were reduced to rubble at the close of that war, and whose were not. The US emerged from World War II with the fewest casualties, its continental territory unscathed, and richer and more powerful by far.
I'm not aware of any scholarship that attempts to quantify the number of civilians killed by the US in its many wars. The fi gure must be in the millions though many policy-makers, military strategists and arm-chair generals would undoubtedly claim that most such civilians were victims of the misfortunes of war -'collateral damage' is the current newspeak on the subject. But in many cases the killing of helpless civilians was deliberate. Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki? General Curtis LeMay insisted there were no such thing as civilians in Japan but one of his principal lieutenants, later Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, has admitted that had the US lost the war he would have been tried as a war criminal. Pyongyang? Hanoi, Haiphong? 'Free fi re zones' across South Vietnam, killing and maiming the very people we were supposed to be saving? Cambodia, Laos, Belgrade, 'Shock and Awe' Baghdad, Falujah? And we mustn't forget the many hundreds of thousands killed by Washington's clients who received advanced American weapons and who were given tacit permission for wholesale murder in places like Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Congo, Angola, Lebanon and Palestine, even Iraq when Saddam Hussein was our man in Baghdad. For a people outraged at the murder of our civilians on 9/11 we are morally anesthetized when it comes to admitting the crimes our own actions, votes and tax dollars have wrought.
A survey of the American past indicates beyond any doubt, and only with the exception of the British during the earliest years of the Republic, that the US has consistently waged warfare always by choice and only against foes that could not win. The romantic fantasy surrounding the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 ignores the fact that the British did not project their full power because they were tied up with more powerful foes in Europe. If they had dispatched their best troops instead of numerous mercenaries the outcome would have been quite different. Washington, Jefferson, Franklin et al. would have swung from the gallows. Since that era the US government, and American public opinion, has always claimed, in all wars, that it was the enemy that initiated hostilities, to which the inherently peaceful American people were honor bound to respond in order to defend ourselves, to restore justice, and overcome 'evildoers'. But this is simply false. Enemy attack of one kind or another was always the justifi cation for war, but in all cases the preconditions, indeed pretexts, for war were set in motion prior to actual combat. American wars have always been matters of choice, not necessity.
Today, less than a generation after the Cold War ended, the United States is at war again, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and is threatening to attack Iran and Pakistan. Of the 191 states comprising the United Nations, the US has military bases in 140 of them. American arms patrol all the seas and skies, including outer space. The Pentagon declares fl atly that its strategic agenda is to achieve nothing less than 'full-spectrum dominance' over any potential foe of the future. While many American offi cials wring their hands about nuclear weapons proliferation, those same public 'servants' believe that the US is justifi ed in constantly upgrading its own nuclear arsenal and missile systems, dismissing the real fear that others have about this. Nor is much made of the hypocrisy of condemning violations of nuclear proliferation in Korea, Pakistan or Iran, while condoning, and even aiding, them in Israel or India.
Much media commentary about the policies of the Bush Administration insists that all this is a perverse departure from the traditional American values and ideals that are claimed to have been in play since the founding of the Republic. But that is a self-serving fantasy fortifying our national conceit that we are a people apart, exceptional and singled out by God or Destiny to redeem humanity. The template for current policies and war was set even before the Founders rose in rebellion against their government. While many of them used powerful rhetoric to exclaim about natural rights and liberty, they only meant such to apply to 'natural aristocrats', like themselves. Their primary goal was to replace their masters in London, to reap the riches of the American continent themselves, thence, as the motto on the dollar proclaims, to establish 'a New Order of the Ages'.
The American enterprise began in savage violence against the peoples Europeans encountered on this continent. The US itself was brought forth by martial exploits glorifi ed and celebrated every Fourth of July, and its vast territory was wrested from others by pretext, aggression, extreme brutality, genocide and 'ethnic cleansing'. Since the US emerged from World War II as the most potent nation in history we have slaughtered millions, directly or not, the vast majority being helpless civilians. In the requisite patriotic storyline, we congratulate ourselves as apostles of peace, compromise and conciliation, and insist that our grossly uneven campaigns are evidence of national heroism mounted against evil.
Mass public acceptance of hypocrisy on this scale requires a deeply-rooted rationale for explaining to ourselves why we can commit naked aggression and not have to experience the guilt or shame which we insist others should feel when they act similarly. In sum, Americans possess a highly adaptive ideology that provides ready-made justifi cations for our actions, and reproaches for those who oppose us. At bottom the American ideology claims to adhere to a morality that defends self-determination universally for all. But that assertion is honored mainly in its breach.
Humans tend to take their idea systems for granted, descended as if from heaven, not paying much attention to how they have developed, what purpose they serve, who transmits ideas in whose interest, or how they've been acculturated to accept them as given. In all cases, the predominant ideas that circulate, that are allowed to circulate, are the ideas of the dominant members of any given society, and they justify or rationalize the privileges, advantages and interests the system gives them. So long as any given system works well enough for most of the population a level of stability sustains the status quo.
Americans pretend not to be subservient to set dogma, believing ourselves to be utterly pragmatic and utilitarian; that is to say, non-ideological. We even contend to be anti-ideological when we oppose the claims of communists or jihadists, yet refuse to believe that we ourselves are captives of an idea system that colors our every perception and renders us incapable of seeing the world as it really is, much less seeing ourselves as others see us. That belief system has developed and evolved over the 400 years since Britain erupted from its slim borders. Inheriting ideas and methods from British empire-building, the US eventually surpassed its parent in scope and method. The American idea system, which justifies and explains the economic and political system, has evolved incrementally, with each stage building upon earlier suppositions derived originally from Britain itself. No radical break occurred as was the case with the French, Russian or Chinese Revolutions. Both the American and British polities evolved along a similar trajectory. From the beginning in the US a self-selected and tiny elite spoke of 'We the people' and 'democracy' but actually feared popular rule, and created two-tiered political institutions designed to thwart it, much like their model, the British Parliament. The system of profi t known as capitalism has always been claimed as the only engine of economic and political activity that can rationally meet human needs. Though the communist world was condemned for its 'slave system', we breezily dismiss the fact that the American system at its inception was built on the backs of the dispossessed and enslaved, or people in other conditions of servitude, and is today proclaimed as the culmination of human political evolution. More than 150 years ago, during America's bloodiest war, Abraham Lincoln declared that the US was 'the last, best hope of mankind'. More recently, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright averred that 'we are the indispensable nation'. For some time now humans in most 'advanced' civilizations have regarded themselves as the crown of creation. Today Americans believe they are the apex of human social evolution.
At every stage of American development key ideas circulated widely to rationalize the circumstances and policies of the day. Actions, often brutal, revealed true motivations. At the dawn of British colonization, Protestant and Puritan religious ideas portrayed a 'New Canaan', a new land endowed to a new 'Chosen People'. The early republic advanced ideas already prevalent in England, borrowed in part from the study of ancient Roman texts, about the rights of citizens and balanced government, although ancient certainties that only an aristocracy should rule were also retained. By the mid-1800s religious ideology merged with what was claimed to be 'scientifi c' racism in the doctrine of 'Manifest Destiny', avowing that the rapid spread of Anglo-American civilization across the entire continent was evidence of God's approval and blessing upon the United States. By the turn of the twentieth century, with massive demographic shifts and industrialization utterly transforming the social landscape, the national ideology proclaimed that the American way of organizing society was the most advanced the planet had ever witnessed, and called for the world to open its doors to American capital. At the start of both World Wars I and II, as economic collapse threatened the very foundation of the American system, the nation promoted itself as the savior of democracy, pitted against the forces of aggression and militarism, utterly discounting the means by which the US has always wielded its power.
We shield ourselves from such unpleasant truths by imagining we have created this most materially prosperous society by virtue of our own industry, creative genius, work ethic and our exceptionally humane national character. We fantasize that if nations or peoples remain 'undeveloped' and mired in poverty, it can only be because they are slothful, or uneducated, lacking in drive or ambition, or otherwise benighted. Others see more clearly. As an African student of mine once put it, angering American students in the process, 'With what are we to develop? We have been plundered of our very people and resources for fi ve centuries for the sake of your development! '  The reality is that the United States has become an empire, an empire different in certain respects from others. But just as all empires before it, the American model seeks to enrich itself by exploiting the peoples over whom it rules.
In 1789 upon leaving Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin, who had presided over the Constitutional Convention, was asked what the 55 men inside had accomplished. His answer was terse and succinct: 'A republic if you can keep it!'
Like the other Founders, Franklin was well aware of the slim history of self-governing peoples. In all cases, institutions of representative government, from ancient Greece to Rome to the Italian republics of the Renaissance, had decayed owing to corruption and had devolved into dictatorship. Old Ben was not optimistic about the chances for the newest republic. Rome had once been a functioning republic with popular institutions to safeguard the rights of citizens, but for a full century before an emperor assumed the throne these had been collapsing as the hunger for more land and treasure and the armies to procure these became the principal preoccupation, fi rst of the ruling classes, then of the plebs. Even the imperial dictatorship was circumspect enough to retain the outward symbols of representative government like the Senate and tribunes of the people, in order to foster the illusion that civil rights were still intact. But Rome was increasingly ruled by the sword and by imperial fi at.
The same fate is now befalling the United States. Every president since World War II has engrossed the powers and perquisites of the offi ce. Congress is but a debating society doling out treasure to its corporate benefactors, chiefl y banks, insurance giants, oil corporations and military contractors. Bit by bit the Bill of Rights erodes before our eyes with measures like the Patriot Act eroding privacy rights and the prohibition against unwarranted searches. American 'popular' culture (manufactured from above) is little more than videonic 'bread and circuses', the imperial Roman practice of distributing food to the masses when unemployment rose too steeply, and allowing them entry into the chariot races and gladiatorial combat in the arenas, in order to let off frustration that might have led to riots. If ordinary Americans oppose the current wars they do so for the most part only tepidly because we are a people, like others, who prefer the guise of fantasy to reality. We have the most bloated civilization and lifestyle ever seen on planet earth and we know, if only by keeping this forbidden knowledge just below our consciousness, how we got to this state, and whom we had to kill. And we do not want our globalized cornucopia to cease providing its fruits. If the resources we need to sustain our conspicuous consumption happen to be in other people's countries, if their labor is cheaper in order to provide the goods, then history obliges us to do what the Romans did. And we do.
The United States was born amidst war, slavery and genocide at the dawn of the Age of Empire. The American system of production and allocation required unpaid or cheap labor and began with outright plunder and annexation of other peoples' land. That system has evolved to deal with domestic inequality, mal-distribution of wealth and political instability by continually enlarging the pie, at the expense of others. Though elites remain fi rmly in control of power and own or control the vast bulk of resources, enough surplus is generated so that, with signifi cant exceptions, the American system has been able to include vast sections of the middle and working classes in its material bounty and rewards, but always because others had to die or be dispossessed. As long as the American economy does not allow extreme poverty and unemployment to rise above a certain threshold and affect the largely white middle class, it has generally had at least the passive support of a majority, except when the inherent defects lead to recession or depression. But the prism of ideology has always fi ltered out much in the larger spectrum of reality. We refuse to believe that the American way of life is, and always has been, the way of war, conquest and empire. We refuse to believe that many Americans enjoy bloated, wasteful lives by wreaking havoc upon others, and because we have promoted our own model of industrial development as the zenith of human progress we have inspired or induced other nations to follow the example, thus infl icting mayhem upon the very biosphere itself. We could, if we were honest, dub ourselves the culture of spoliation.
To be sure there are some who will say that throughout the human condition it has always been thus. History would seem to agree. But we Americans are in profound denial of the extent to which we are not exceptions to this arc of history. Thus, any serious hope or prospect for peace in the twenty-fi rst century must frankly confront the indisputably bloody history and present policies of the most potent armed entity ever to bestride the planet. And then, or else, we must begin to live up to the ideals and professed values we claim and teach small children.
Most are taught that the American Revolution was necessary to right the intolerable injustices the British had visited upon their colonial subjects. Yet analysis of the fi nancial interests of the principal Founders indicates clearly that they stood to gain far more by being rulers than the ruled. Their rhetoric of freedom certainly was not applied to the majority of Americans, including most white men who were not allowed to vote. The Declaration of Independence decried the 'slavery' that British rule had imposed upon the likes of Washington, Jefferson and many others but manifestly excluded the real slaves. No sooner had the infant US come into existence than it set out immediately to replace the former mother country as the ascendant power in the entire western hemisphere, more than once attempting to wrest Canada too. It waged war against the Spanish and the French to acquire the lands they claimed, and then against the indigenous peoples over whom the empires alleged to reign. In the most rapid territorial expansion in history the US transited the continent 'from sea to shining sea', piling up a mountain of corpses along the way and trailing millions of slaves in their wake.
By the middle of the nineteenth century the southern slavocracy's desire to exploit more land for the profi ts generated by unpaid labor dovetailed with the northern industrial-fi nancial elite's longing for the ports of Los Angeles and San Diego. The problem was that these lands belonged to the newly independent nation of Mexico. So the dark art of pretext was employed, as it would be so many times again, and Mexico was charged with violating American territory, whereas exactly the reverse had occurred. The result was that Mexico lost almost half of its land and the US augmented itself by about one-fourth. Now a Pacifi c power, the US lost no time in crossing the vast ocean to open what was hoped would be the Great China Market. Bases would be needed and in due time Samoa and Hawaii were annexed, the latter by force. The hermit island-nation of Japan could serve nicely as ports for American warships and merchant vessels, but the local daimyos, or warlords, wanted to be left alone and isolated. This would not do. So American warships were dispatched to teach them the error of their ways. The result was Japan's awakening to the fact that much of Asia was being conquered by westerners. Putting aside their differences Japan's rulers unifi ed and centralized authority in their emperor and entered the contest of empire themselves, hoping to beat the west at its own game, a move that would bring on the tragic Pacifi c War of the mid-twentieth century.
Back in the US, acquisition of the Mexican territories spurred the onset of Civil War and while the competing elements of the American ruling classes sorted out their differences to the tune of 620,000 dead, the nation would await the further development of its fi nancial, industrial and military thrust.
By the late 1800s, with most native tribes subdued or eradicated, with growing wealth produced by the internal combustion engine, electricity and the poorly paid labor of immigrant millions, the US was set to emerge as one of the new arrivals on the stage of empire, hungry to displace the competition. As matters turned out, in addition to Japan there was another latecomer hungry for its own place in the sun -Germany. The martial landscape of the coming twentieth century was looming into focus.
In 1898 another pretext was employed for war, this time against tottering Spain. In the midst of the worst depression in history up to that time, the American polity was being rent asunder. The unprecedented wealth resulting from industrialization remained in the hands of a tiny elite of 'plutocrats' while huddled masses endured terrible privations. Popular demands for a radical redistribution of wealth terrifi ed the plutocrats and nouveau riche. Their solution was to openly embrace empire and seek new sources of wealth overseas, thereby enlarging the economic pie and dispensing larger crumbs to the bottom of American society while retaining control at the top. Though members of the patrician classes like Teddy Roosevelt declared that the object of war was to liberate the peoples of Puerto Rico, Guam, Cuba and the Philippines, they were more worried about the threat of revolution at home and the means to avoid it.
In short order, with a crushing victory over Spain, the Caribbean Sea became, as the Romans used to say, mare nostrum, 'our sea'. All four island-nations became de facto American colonies, exploited as bases for the American navy and for their resources, their people now serving American masters. Cuba's constitution was written in Washington and came with the proviso that the US could intervene militarily on the island any time American interests were said to be at risk. The American base at Guantanamo Bay was signed over in perpetuity for insurance. The Philippines had been promised outright independence but Manila Bay put the US at 'the doorstep to Asia' and no imperial advantage such as this could be surrendered no matter what had been guaranteed. When Filipinos rose in rebellion against the army that had claimed to free them, the US had its fi rst counter-insurgency jungle war and waged it with utmost brutality and racism, killing upwards of 200,000 civilians, the greatest number in one confl ict up to that time. The Philippine War could have served as the template for the war in Vietnam but by the 1950s Americans had long since forgotten that the US had conquered the Philippines 40 years before the Japanese tried to in World War II.
With the riches of Asia looming, which of the new empires would dominate?
At this critical stage the US enunciated its plans for the future and on fi rst sight these seemed benign and equitable as well. The Open Door policy asserted the right of all empires to access the wealth of China on equal terms. But since the US economy could already out-compete its capitalist rivals, and would begin with a clear-cut advantage, American competitors understood that the US could potentially close the doors to them. Japan especially took notice. Washington was asserting the fundamental rules of a new game, applicable to the entire world, even if the US was not yet powerful enough to enforce them. But the message was clear. Henceforth, the markets and resources of the world would remain open to American penetration. From that moment on the US would rely increasingly on its arms to enforce what would be its overarching policy.
Meanwhile, the shores of the new American lake had to be pacifi ed. American marines landed in Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and those nations were brought to heel. Colombia was refusing to allow a new inter-oceanic canal through its province of Panama to enable the American navy and merchant fl eet to pass easily between the Atlantic and Pacifi c. Roosevelt's solution was simple. He told Washington's handpicked Panamanian rebels to declare independence and then dispatched the navy and marines to prevent Colombia from doing anything about it. Some in Congress objected to this naked land grab but, said Teddy, 'I took the Panama Canal, let Congress debate!' Only a few years later Woodrow Wilson would justify a new war against Mexico with the words 'I will teach them to elect good men.'
Now an imperial power of the fi rst rank with an economy larger than the next three rivals combined, the United States stood ready to challenge for supremacy. In Europe the older empires Britain, France and Russia now also faced a unifi ed and highly militarized Germany. With the outbreak of World War I Europe was about to self-destruct.
President Wilson ran for re-election in 1916 claiming he would keep the country out of the war but his policies fl atly contradicted that assertion. Wilson proclaimed neutrality yet, on terms essentially dictated from Wall Street, the US had been steadily building up a vested and one-sided interest in the war's outcome. Unless the Allies won the war, the money loaned and invested in them would never be repaid, and if Germany came to dominate central Europe that vital market might be closed to American business, at least on American terms. Worse, that nation might rise as a powerful economic competitor in the very markets of the world desired by American enterprise.
Germany sought to strike at Britain's economic lifeline with the US and began sinking British merchant vessels, infl icting enormous losses. When in desperation Germany announced it would sink all ships attempting to enter British waters, including American ones, and then did so, Wilson and the war hawks had their reason to enter the war and to attempt to shape the order that would follow.
The entry of the US immediately altered the battleground and forced Germany to seek a cease-fi re, hoping to gain at least half of its war aims. But it was internally divided and too weak. The British and French were able, despite Wilson's efforts, to impose draconian peace terms that ravaged Germany's economy even further, ultimately setting the stage for the rise of the Nazis.
Wilson's proclaimed agenda for a 'peace without victory' and to 'make the world safe for democracy' came to nothing. The war destroyed the Russian crown and brought on communism. The colonies of Britain and France sensed their growing weakness and they desperately sought to maintain their eroding imperial positions. In Germany, Adolph Hitler came to power vowing to return the nation to glory and to exact revenge against the victors, the communists -and the Jews. In Asia Japan rejected the American Open Door and occupied Manchuria. All the 'Great War' had accomplished was to make the world safe for more carnage. The brief truce unraveled and the world descended again into the maelstrom of war.
American culture perceives World War II as the 'Good War'. Accordingly, the US, again with the greatest reluctance, took up the sword righteously to rout those who had treacherously stabbed us in the back, and thereby prevented the evildoers from achieving their totalitarian aims. As the other empires descended into war the American people insisted that their government stay out. But there is no disputing the fact that prior to December 7, 1941  President Roosevelt secretly ordered the US Navy into the Battle of the Atlantic as a de facto ally of Britain and engaged in a real shooting war with Germany. As Japan expanded its occupation of China, Roosevelt allowed American fi ghter pilots to resign from the Army Air Corps and fl y for China in aircraft supplied by the US. Roosevelt provoked both nations. As the commander of the US Pacifi c fl eet revealed, FDR hoped that 'Sooner or later the Japanese would commit an overt act against the United States and the nation would be willing to enter the war.' Thus Congress' Neutrality Act, the expressed will of the people, had been rendered null and void. Ten days before Pearl Harbor, on FDR's orders, the US State Department issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw from China and Indochina with the full knowledge that Japan would no more capitulate than Washington would have, had Tokyo demanded the return of California to Mexico. FDR desired war and knowingly made Japan an offer it could only refuse.
Contrary to what many university freshmen believe, the US did not enter World War II to save Jews or rescue the defenseless. Nor did Germany and Japan have the remotest possibility of invading, much less conquering, the United States or of bombing it from afar. Both nations were creating their own self-contained spheres in regions the US wished to penetrate, much as the US had been doing in the western hemisphere. Both nations' imperial aims in vital areas of world trade promised to shut out American capital and business, at least on the Open Door terms that were the essence of the US strategy. Both nations, if successful, would build giant economic powerhouses competing with the US. Given the nature of capitalism there would be no escape from depression and domestic instability at home other than to defeat the competitors and then to open access to resources and consumers by force.
The US faced much the same problem as it had in the late nineteenth century. The inability of the American public to absorb what the economy produced was a major factor in the Great Depression. The surplus had to be sold abroad. This time opening new sources of consumption would not be as easy as in the 1890s. Now the US faced the 'nightmare of a closed world'. To avoid a radically diminished standard of living, and a profound change in the political structure at home, ruling elements of the American oligarchy maneuvered to remake the global order entirely and conform it to American corporate interests. This would require entering the war at the right time, under the right circumstances. World War I had cost 110,000 dead; this time the ruling elite would have to sacrifi ce 405,000 lives, not to mention the millions of enemy civilians killed.
The notion that the primary motive of the FDR Administration was humanitarian is belied by its deliberate inaction on the Nazi extermination of Europe's Jews and by the fact that victory against Hitler was impossible without an alliance with Soviet communism, a system every bit as murderous as the Nazi regime, and one equally committed to thwarting American capitalism, if by different means. At the war's end the Red Army occupied half the territory the US wished to free from Hitler and cut off from capitalist penetration. While far less powerful than the US, the Soviet Union was still potent enough to obstruct the American grand agenda. The wartime marriage of convenience unraveled, devolving into the most deadly arms race in history, more than once bringing the planet to the brink of nuclear war.
Unscathed by World War II, the US emerged the most powerful and wealthiest nation in history. As such, it alone could spell the terms by which both its allies and enemies could be reconstructed and re-integrated into the new world order desired in Washington and on Wall Street. The long-range goal of a world open to American business enterprise on American terms seemed at last in sight. There were two great obstacles, however. On the one hand, the colonies that American allies and enemies had exploited now sensed the weakness of their European imperial overlords. They would soon be in full revolt. In another of history's ironies the very defeat of Germany and Japan enabled two even greater powers -the USSR and China -to rush into the vacuum and obstruct American goals. The world American rulers wished to reconstruct on their terms was not cooperating.
As millions of soldiers returned to the US, a resumption of mass unemployment loomed and those who had directed wartime production called for a 'permanent war economy'. For that a permanent enemy would be required. Thus yesterday's ally became the new foe. All opposition to the American grand strategy was ascribed to the communists (though that was untrue) and on the basis of this they were proclaimed the new threat. American society was militarized as never before, increasingly ruled by what President Dwight Eisenhower would call the 'military-industrial complex'. The Cold War that replaced the carnage of World War II lasted almost half a century, and witnessed numerous hot wars across the planet, from Korea, to the Middle East, to Vietnam, Southeast Asia and Afghanistan, and back to the Middle East. In addition to outright war the newly established National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency ensured there would always be new foes to fi ght as they fostered the very anti-Americanism they claimed to oppose by engaging in illegal, covert operations across the planet, overthrowing governments, assassinating leaders who opposed their agenda and undermining entire economies. In this new Orwellian world millions of human beings died while the corporations that fed from the dollars provided by the warfare state racked up trillions in profi t, all in the name of national security.
By outspending the communists in the arms race the US hoped to force the USSR to choose between the proverbial 'guns and butter': either to provide material prosperity for its citizens, or to devote the bulk of productive capacity to the arms race. Thus unable to meet its promises of a materially rich and classless society, communism would collapse from within. This was a profoundly dangerous gambit and during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 brought the planet to the brink of Armageddon.
Even as the 'Evil Empire' of the Soviet Union collapsed in the late 1980s, there would be no end to enemies. Even as they outspent almost all other nations combined on national defense and deployed their armed forces to two-thirds of all the nations on earth, American leaders insisted the US was a lone island of righteousness encircled by geo-political sharks. The USSR's demise was hastened by the trap the US had laid by arming Afghan militants and then drawing Soviet forces into a no-win war in Afghanistan. By playing a major role in the utter destruction of that poor nation the US was thus setting itself up for what the CIA terms 'blowback'. Having recruited many thousands of Islamic jihadists from the entire Muslim world to wage holy war on the evil empire, the US soon saw the weapons it had provided those clients turned upon itself. As the twenty-fi rst century dawned the US would fi nd itself bogged down in an impasse in Afghanistan.
No sooner had the American ploy to fell the communist giant succeeded than Saddam Hussein, who had been assisted to power in Iraq by the US in the fi rst place, was regaled as the re-incarnation of Hitler. Earlier he had proved valuable by killing at least half a million Persians when Iran had broken away from the American imperial yoke and raised the specter of Islamic revolution in the Middle East. Yet, when Saddam stepped outside the role created for him by invading Kuwait, putting the US supply of oil, its cost and the value of the dollar at risk, American forces almost effortlessly crushed him, while allowing him to remain in power so that a convenient demon could always be invoked.
Even before the attacks of 9/11 the so-called neo-conservatives who had ascended to power in the George W. Bush Administration had issued their manifesto 'Rebuilding America's Defenses'. The document emphasized the extraordinary opportunity the US now had with the collapse of the USSR and called for nothing less than American dominance in every conceivable sphere of life -economic, political, military and cultural -but bemoaned the probability that the plan could not become operational without a 'catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor'.
Then the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon became precisely that catalyzing event.
Although American arms and a vise-like embargo had nullifi ed Saddam since 1991, he was nevertheless held culpable for the horrifying attacks in the US on 9/11. The claim by the Bush Administration that Iraq had abetted the attacks and had nuclear weapons it could launch at the US were fabrications designed to win popular support for the invasion of Mesopotamia, the takeover of the world's second greatest reservoir of petroleum, and the opportunity to build permanent American bases from which to project military power throughout the Middle East.
The 'New American Century' envisioned by the neo-conservatives, and accommodated by neo-liberals, therefore depends on maintaining control of the critical fuel necessary to power the American economy and its massive military machine that now straddles the globe. Yet the very exhortations we delivered to former enemies to follow our example have brought forth bitter fruit. They have followed our example. China and Russia are now fellow travelers and as such compete with the US for the very resources and markets that we had previously sought to deny them. In the inevitable irony of history China now deposits its surplus production on the US and holds a substantial portion of the US national debt. Our new capitalist comrades are now more competitive than before. It is past the time when humans understand that such a 'zerosum game' or beggar-my-neighbor system inexorably leads to violence, and given the advancement of super-destructive weapons, the arc of history has brought the entire species to a crisis. We now assuredly have the means to make ourselves extinct. Unless Americans begin to re-orient the employment of our power away from hypocrisy and toward genuine international cooperation and compromise we will be met inexorably by resistance that will take new, unparalleled and destructive forms. We cannot continue to ignore the exacting toll this mutual competition has taken on the environment and the diminution of un-renewable resources that will, in turn, lead to yet more confl ict. The circumstances are ripe for a mere accident or minor spark to ignite another, perhaps fi nal, global holocaust. The times and the future of humanity itself call for an unparalleled commitment to global mutual cooperation, compromise and assistance.
The Great Seal of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts depicts a native dressed in traditional Algonquian clothing, holding a bow and an arrow with its point turned downward, an obvious symbol of that peoples' ignominious defeat. This image remains from the seal of the original Massachusetts Bay Colony, which as early as the 1640s adopted the likeness and depicted the Indian pleading 'Come on over and help us'. The state motto accompanying the seal is in Latin and is translated as 'By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty'. These are curious insignia of statehood since natives made mighty efforts to prevent Massachusetts from becoming a British possession at their expense in the fi rst place and Massachusetts was also one of the fi rst British colonies systematically to depopulate itself of Indians and to abuse and deprive of liberty such few as remained, even those who converted to Christianity. In fact the very name 'Massachusetts' is an Algonquian word and is what the people living on the bay near Boston by the same name called themselves. Today there are no members of the tribe once known as the Massachusett. They were systematically rooted out of their homes, sold into slavery or killed and are now extinct. Only their name remains. Their crime was that they believed the land they had inhabited for uncounted generations belonged to them.
These simple illustrations sum up fairly well the history of the American relationship to the native peoples who inhabited what is now the United States before the European conquests and, for that matter, also characterize the relations of the United States with the non-European peoples in those nations upon which it has waged war most recently. American troops in Vietnam regularly called the areas outside defensive perimeters 'Indian country'. A phrase more laden with meaning could not be imagined. The originating assumption was that the aboriginal tribes and clans needed civilizing and this could only be done by Englishmen. Should native peoples (or today those under American occupation) reject the American enlightening mission, the ultimate sanction was and always has been deadly violence. The substantial bloodshed accompanying the educative enterprise carried out by Americans is, and has always been, claimed to be in the service of the higher and nobler purposes of liberty, democracy, or national security.
Of course the so-called civilizing mission was always ultimately a lie. The real venture was to take land and resources from others and transfer these to the conquerors, or to open or maintain sources of gain that would deprive the other of self-determination.
Another curiosity involves the fact that in Washington, D.C. there is a museum devoted to the Holocaust perpetrated in Europe during World War II by the Nazis. The historical record clearly shows that while the United States obviously waged war upon Nazi Germany it did next to nothing to mitigate the Final Solution, the systematic extermination of Jews, so the museum presumably refl ects some sense of national guilt. More curious is the absence of such a museum and the collective shame that would memorialize the holocaust that transpired in the United States, and the rest of the Americas, and the horrors and mass deaths engendered by the African slave trade. That vile traffi c, in turn, was fostered when deliberate slaughter and European diseases so ravaged native populations that too few Indians remained to be enslaved. All this so that Europeans could reap the riches of the conquered peoples and lands of the Americas. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 he wasn't doing anything the Americans hadn't done too.
Apologists for the European conquest as a boon both for Europeans and natives insist that the destruction of native peoples and their cultures was inadvertent, owing largely to the unforeseen ravages of diseases to which the natives had no resistance. Yet, the record is clear that Spaniards, French, Dutch, Portuguese and British all took advantage of the opportunities that smallpox, measles, diptheria and many other pathogens provided to pursue dominance throughout the western hemisphere. In British North America smallpox was sometimes transmitted deliberately in the knowledge that the natives were particularly vulnerable. When illness did not carry off populations entirely, the effects of forced labor and outright slaughter did. The fact remains that, as a major historian of the American holocaust avers, 'the destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world'.

The myth that microbes were the culprit in Europe's takeover of the western hemisphere is widespread, as is the parallel fable that the Americas were largely un-peopled. Both fantasies have been cultivated precisely to deny the fact that 95 per cent of the hemisphere's native population, numbering in the tens of millions, were killed or died as a result of the conquest within only a few generations of European arrival.

The murderous rivalry that developed between the European Atlantic nations of Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain and France was well underway before 1492, leading inexorably to the global wars of the twentieth century, as well as much violence since. That fateful date marks the point at which the conquest of the planet by Europeans began in earnest with calamitous consequences for the indigenous peoples of Asia, Africa and the Americas.
Columbus was hardly crossing the Atlantic to prove the world was round, as children are still taught. The shape of the globe was known 25 centuries ago, probably much earlier. He wanted a shorter route to the east, to the source of luxuries that were imported into Europe via the fabled Silk Road that transversed all of Eurasia. Determined to outcompete rival Portugal in the Indies, Columbus made his fi rst landfall on the island later named Hispaniola, today comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Because he believed that he had indeed reached the eastern shores of Asia the islands retain the name, now the West Indies, hence the term 'Indian'. There he found a peaceful people similar in language and culture to those on the other Caribbean islands, who lived amidst such plenty that they had no need of a complex social system, nor did they have or desire the kind of riches after which the Spaniards lusted. But they did posses some golden trinkets, obtained in trade, which suggested more opulent societies on the mainland.
In their fever to obtain riches the Spanish observed no scruple in their efforts to discover their source. The Arawak (called so by contemporary anthropologists and also sometimes called 'Tainos' or Caribs) saw such jewelry as they had as mere trinkets but Columbus and his soldiers accused the natives of hiding their wealth. What followed has been and still is a largely suppressed aspect of American history, almost never discussed, except by indigenous peoples, during the annual offi cial celebrations of the national holiday, Columbus Day. The barbarities perpetrated by the Spaniards upon the Caribbean peoples, and subsequently by all Spanish conquistadors and their rivals throughout the Americas, were so atrocious that their practices are quite literally comparable to those of the Nazis.
Columbus and all subsequent Spanish conquerors brought the cross of Christianity with them and priests to bring the natives to the 'true faith'. It is all but impossible to reconcile the religion they claimed, in which compassion and charity are said to be among the highest virtues, to their abysmally cruel and merciless crimes. Usually the Catholic clerics were the only literate members of the expeditions and in some cases left an honest and horrifying picture of what transpired. One such chronicler was the monk Bartolomeo de las Casas, whose diary is extensive and gruesomely detailed. He also seems to have had something like the conscience that Christians assert is a hallmark of their faith and he became an outspoken advocate for the natives in Spain. To their victims, certainly, the conquistadores must have seemed like demons from the hellish regions.
From Hispaniola Columbus dispatched forays to the islands of Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico and others where, as his son Fernando airily put it, the Spanish spent their time 'looting and destroying all they found'.

It was in present-day Central America and the Andean region of South America that the Spanish conquistadors found civilizations to plunder beyond their fevered imaginations. Far from being the 'primitives' who were said to occupy North America (a falsehood in any case), the Aztec civilization of Meso-America, and the Maya, Toltec and Olmec ones before that, were superior by almost any measure, with the exception of steel weapons and gunpowder, to any civilization in Europe. The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and the Inca city of Quosco (Cuzco) were far larger, and more populated, than any city in Europe, and were cleaner too. Madrid, London and Paris were pestilential stinking sewers by comparison. It is estimated that 25 million people lived in the great valley of Mexico at the time Hernando Cortez began his conquest in 1519. 
12
13
In Mexico hydroponic agriculture was practiced; in Peru great terraces were carved to capture the melting waters of the Andes and thus both cultures provided food on a scale that dwarfed anything in Europe, where famine was endemic. Speaking of the great civilization he encountered, Cortez himself admitted that 'In Spain there is nothing to compare with it.' Writing to his king he declared: I cannot describe one-hundredth part of all the things which could be mentioned…which, although badly described, will I well know, be so remarkable as not to be believed, for we who saw them with our own eyes could not grasp them with our understanding.

15
Cortez initially encountered members of a tribe that was in confl ict with the Aztec who were attempting to subordinate them. The Tlaxcaltecs infl icted heavy casualties on the Spaniards and could easily have destroyed Cortez's cohort. Seeing new and surprising weapons they instead hoped the Spanish would be their allies and help them wrest independence from the Aztec. When the conquistadors approached the capital of the Aztec at Tenochtitlan with perhaps 150,000 Indian allies, the Aztec emperor, Montezuma, sent envoys bearing gifts and then welcomed the Spanish into the city. When the Spanish saw that the gifts were made of precious metals, said one Aztec, they 'picked up the gold and fi ngered it like monkeys…their bodies swelled with greed, and their hunger was ravenous; they hungered like pigs for gold.' Cortez himself admitted that 'We Spaniards suffer from a disease of the heart, the specifi c remedy for which is gold.'

Thirteen years after Cortez assaulted Mexico, in 1532 Francisco Pizarro, seeking similar fame and riches, executed out the conquest of Peru. Like Cortez he was a master of treachery and deceit. By that time the Spanish had also overrun Central America and what is now Venezuela and Colombia, and smallpox had made its way to the Andes, where the Inca ruled an empire larger than China's, indeed the largest the world had seen at the time. The disease had killed the ruling emperor and thousands of local peoples and set in motion a struggle for power, eventually won by his son, Atahualpa. Incan society was thus already severely depopulated and weakened internally. When Pizarro and his 168 men approached the throne of the new emperor, who was surrounded by 80,000 of his own troops, the conquistador suddenly attacked and captured him. The Inca were astounded and frightened by the gunfi re and by horses that they had never seen before. The Spaniard's armor also protected them from the stone weapons of the Inca with the result that many thousands of Inca died that day without one Spanish casualty. Subsequently, because they had invested the emperor with supreme authority, Atahualpa continued to rule in captivity at the direction of Pizarro, who demanded ransom in gold and silver. Believing that Spanish greed could be used to his advantage the Incan emperor ordered all the gold and silver in the palaces to be stripped. 
21
To pay the ransom for Atahualpa's release the Inca melted down an almost inconceivable quantity of gold and silver objects. Even so the Spanish demanded more, eventually melting the most sacred objects of the Incan religion. Conquistadors also burned the sacred and historical books in Peru and Mexico, thus depriving the world of the storehouse of knowledge that both civilizations possessed. In any case, Pizarro betrayed his promise to release the emperor and murdered him, an act which effectively decapitated the social structure of Incan society. Like Cortez, Pizarro encouraged subject tribes to revolt, and almost overnight Incan rule over their empire collapsed. Meanwhile smallpox continued its desolation of the Indian population and the Spanish ruthlessly plundered local peoples, those who had assisted them and the Inca alike. Taking over the silver mines and the coca plantations, the Spanish mercilessly worked the natives to death. Life expectancy of an Indian in forced labor during this early period in Peru was about three to four months, about the same as an inmate-laborer at Auschwitz in the 1940s. 
21
The story of Spanish conquest, and of the Portuguese in Brazil, the Dutch in Guyana and what is now New York, the French in the Caribbean and Canada and the British throughout North America, follows essentially the same plot. As the peoples of the Americas were subjugated, their lands taken and their riches carried off, the Europeans intensifi ed their own murderous rivalries with each other, all aimed at further conquests throughout the planet. While the Spanish would be the fi rst Europeans to establish colonies in North America -in Florida and the southwest -it was of course, the British who put their cultural, linguistic and imperial stamp upon what would become the United States.
Scandinavians had beaten Columbus to the 'New World' arriving in what is now Greenland and Canada centuries before he did, but those colonies disappeared for reasons that remain open to speculation -perhaps warfare with the natives, or inability to adapt to climate change, or both. After 1492 numerous mariners stopped at various points along the North American coast, trading with natives, kidnapping many as slaves and depositing their germs.
At fi rst natives of North America were not concerned about the newcomers, seeing them as weak and incapable of surviving in their attempted settlements, but also as treacherous. In fact, the Spanish attempted to establish a colony very near to what would later become the fi rst British colony of Jamestown, but were driven off. Like the Tlaxcaltecs of Mexico, the peoples encountered by the British in their fi rst colonies of Virginia and Massachusetts -the Powhatan and Wampanoag -attempted to use the colonists to advantage in their own relations with rival tribes. As was the case in Mexico and Peru, the British were quite successful in their strategy of 'divide and rule'. Though the assistance of natives was at fi rst crucial to British colonists' very survival, the newcomers, who eventually came in overwhelming numbers, ended up defeating and exploiting friend and foe alike. Despite their initial assurances to the natives that they wished to live side by side in peace with them, dispossessing 'savages' from their ancestral lands was the colonial intent from the beginning.
In his narrative of the Jamestown settlement, Captain John Smith said that he told Wahunsonacock, whom the British called Powhatan, as they also called the people he led, that the colonists had come only temporarily to repair ships. But the Virginia Company was a joint-stock, profi teering enterprise, a forebear of the modern corporation, and the colonists carried with them specifi c instructions that they were to establish a permanent settlement in order to challenge Spain's Catholic empire. 
23
Religion was a factor since England had rejected the papacy and Catholicism and had turned toward many different strands of Protestantism, and much rhetoric was expended in the claim that Protestant Britain had a mission to bring the true faith to the heathen and impede the reach of Catholicism. Puritanism would become especially important in the British colonies of New England and would put an indelible stamp upon the American national psyche. But military advantage, and the access to wealth that made it possible, was the overriding motive of the powerful, and ordinary English colonists were impelled by forces that had been drastically altering the European world and England especially for centuries.
The Protestant Reformation had developed out of the breakdown of what historians term feudalism (though no template applied everywhere) throughout northern Europe which, in turn, had been caused by advances in food production, technology, growing populations, warfare and the fact that laws and traditions no longer accommodated the realities of everyday life. Catholic Europe was a place of tradition with an emphasis on community in a context of rigid hierarchy. Society and the production of necessities was organized around use and immediate consumption. Society was seen as static and unchanging. If there was a 'Catholic ethic' it was that the individual owed his fi rst allegiance to the greater community.
As populations swelled, cities grew, and trade and commerce became more complex, the laws and customs of traditional society were no longer suitable for the actual conditions of life. Ever growing numbers of people dwelled in cities outside of rural tradition, many engaged in new occupations and, menacingly, in increasing unemployment. As markets grew larger so the profi t motive swelled too. Soon land was seen as an opportunity to produce for the larger market and for profi t and not for immediate consumption. In England peasants were evicted from the lands they had tilled for centuries and the fi elds were fenced in and enclosed to raise sheep for the growing wool market, not for food crops. As Thomas More, the great British theologian, remarked at the time, the agricultural process had been stood on its head; now, he said, 'Sheep eat men.' Formerly guaranteed a living as farmers, English citizens were now cast into joblessness and fl ooded to the cities (a process underway today throughout what has long been termed the Third World, with similar catastrophic consequences).
This displacement of countless people created a restive population with few resources and condemned to pauperization. One of the principal motives of the British colonial endeavor was to move the more dangerous elements of society from the British Isles and transfer them to America (and elsewhere). Many of them had found a kind of employment as soldiers in the various wars between the English, Scots and Irish, and then the English Civil War. Rough and violent men, they would practice their warcraft anew in the colonies.
Rather than working for immediate use and consumption this new English working class worked, when it could obtain work, for wages set by new masters. At the same time another new social class arose, known as the 'bourgeoisie', or middle class between the hereditary landed nobility and the emerging wage-earning classes. As this new social grouping grew in wealth obtained from trade and commerce, and by paying wage earners less than the value of the goods they produced, it was slowly displacing the old nobility as the new ruling class.
Newly emerging social classes were torn loose from formal convention and, loyal primarily to themselves, challenged traditional authority and fostered profoundly new institutions and laws, including new religious sects and what would become the modern corporation. All of these changes discomfi ted peoples anchored to tradition. Living in uncertainty and insecurity they sought solace in new ideas that would explain and rationalize the great social upheavals. These ideas took the form largely of religion. In England the Reformation challenged Catholicism and bitter internecine strife followed, with the execution of the Catholic monarch King James I. Yet the new Church of England, the establishment of which had initiated the Reformation in Britain, became a target of rebellion too, and Protestantism would soon devolve into numerous competing, and ultimately warring, sects.
The English Civil War of 1640-1660 occurred between King Charles I and his loyalists, mainly the hereditary nobility, and those members of Parliament whose social origins lay mainly in the emerging middle classes. This civil strife has often been called the Puritan Revolution because the religious persuasion of the king's opponents was prevailingly Puritan. These terms, however, disguise the real underlying issues, which were overwhelmingly social and economic. Most simply, the constitutional issue was, on the one side, between the king who claimed to rule by traditional feudal 'divine right' with his allies, the landed nobility, against many in Parliament who claimed rights and privileges independent of the crown and believed that sovereignty should be theirs. In short, the civil war that appeared to be based upon religious beliefs was primarily a class war based upon competing economic and political interests. The Puritans largely represented the commercial middle classes whose primary goal was the pursuit of profi t, but also drew in members of the new class of wage earners, who joined as soldiers in their army. Interestingly, many of these foot soldiers came to profess an egalitarian ideology and later were known as 'levelers' because they wished to see a leveling of all social groupings to the same status. This set of ideas was quite radical and far in advance of its time. The real struggle lay between two different factions: one the old ruling class, the other the would-be new rulers, each seeking the upper hand in control of state power and 'property', one vested in land, the other in 'capital', or money, credit, new forms of real estate and banking. When this period of upheaval and profound change ended, feudal relationships which had been based upon use and immediate consumption were overthrown and replaced with new contract-based relations aimed at profi t and future income. Modern corporate capitalism was in its fi rst stage of development.
The Puritans triumphed for a period and though ultimately displaced, their ideas about political power and property became fundamental in the evolving structure of English society, and importantly would migrate across the sea and evolve into the 'American creed' of individual rights. Well before the Puritans took power in England, they and other Protestants, with new ideas about how society should be organized, were shaping the structure of what would eventually become the United States. Though such ideas were fostered only to encompass Englishmen, they would eventually resonate throughout American society.
Before the English Civil War, and while Protestant ideas were percolating into British society, powerful men at court invoked the 'law of God', which they claimed allowed Christian rulers to settle the lands of the 'Infi dels or Savages' in order to establish 'God's worde'. Sir Walter Raleigh, soldier and adventurer, dreamed of a 'New Britannia' that would rival New Spain in its domains and raw power. Thus the royal charter of 1606 divided the North American coast into two spheres, granted to the newly organized joint stock companies, the forerunners of the modern corporation. The Plymouth group of investors would settle New England, while the London group would establish colonies from North Carolina to the Chesapeake. 
23
The fi rst British colony was attempted at Roanoke about 100 miles south of Jamestown. These settlers were completely unprepared for the rigors of life. They seemingly expected food to drop from the air and gold to spring from the earth. Every last one of them disappeared without a trace. The settlement at Jamestown at fi rst appeared to be heading toward the same fate. John Smith complained that the Virginia colonists disdained physical labor and were obsessed with the lure of gold. 'There was no talke, no hope, no worke, but dig gold, wash gold, refi ne gold, loade gold.' 
24
25
What will it avail you to take that you may quietly have with love, or to destroy them that provide you with food? What can you get by war when we can hide our provisions and fl y to the woods, whereby you must famish, by wronging us your friends? 
26
Yet the British, with rock-ribbed faith in their own superiority, were unwilling to acknowledge their debt. Rather, they maneuvered to get Wahunsonacock to accept submission to King James I. John Smith met with Wahunsonacock and told him that the English king had sent many presents that awaited him at Jamestown. Moreover, the Indian chief was to be crowned, British style, as king of the Powhatans. Wahunsonacock was not deceived, reading the ploy to make him the equivalent of an English vassal. Said the chief: 'If your king have sent me presents, I am also a king, and this my land, 8 daies I will stay to receave them. Your father the Virginia governor, (not King James) is to come to me, not I to him.' 
28
29
The Virginia Company stockholders in England concluded that if the Indians would not accept English rule they would have to be put down with force. They recruited hardened veterans of the Irish campaigns (where the British were subduing the inhabitants of their very fi rst overseas colony) who arrived in 1610 and immediately conducted the same kind of scorched earth policy they had infl icted on Ireland, attacking every tribe in the region, killing women and children. In one case, having captured a woman of high status whom they termed a queen, the British commander said:
And after we marched wth the quene and her children to our Boates again, where beinge no sooner well shipped my sowldiers did begin to murmer becawse the quene and her children were spared. So upon the same a Cowncell beinge called itt was Agreed upon to putt the Children to deathe the wch was effected by throwinge them overboard and shotinge owtt their Brayns in the water yet for all this Crewellty the sowldiers weare not well pleased And I had mutche to doe to save the quenes lyfe for that Time. 
30
In 1622 the Powhatan and other tribes rose in rebellion against the British, who called it the 'Great Massacre' after about one-quarter of the colonists were killed. Now, said the British propagandists, they could be cleared from the land. '[H]aving little of Humanitie', they claimed, they no longer had any right to be treated as humans: …our hands which were tied with gentlenesse and fair useage, are now set at liberty by the treacherous violence of the Savages... so that we…may now by right of Warre, and law of nations, invade and destroy the country, and destroy them who sought to destroy us. 
31
Our fi rst worke is expulsion of the salvages to gaine the free range of the countrey for encrease of Cattle, swine &c which will more then restore us, for it is infi nitely better to have no heathen among us, who at best were but thornes in our sides, then to be at peace and league with them.

Meanwhile the joint-stock company that was chartered in Plymouth, England, recruited members of an ultra-religious sect of Puritans who would enter history as the Pilgrims of the Mayfl ower.
While it is true that this particular group did wish freedom to practice their religious faith, as all schoolchildren are taught, they were by no means keen to extend such a privilege to others, especially to the natives they encountered throughout New England, and as events later showed, the Puritans even persecuted Quakers in much the same way that they had been. The issue of religious freedom is an ideological cloak for the real 'mission' which as the charter of the Plymouth colony attested, was primarily a profi t-seeking operation. Given the riches to be harvested from New England's rich fi sheries, and from the fur and lumber of its forests, this enterprise quickly became ruthlessly warlike as well.
Like the hapless colonists to the south in Virginia, the Plymouth pilgrims were hopelessly unprepared for life in Massachusetts. Most were middle class artisans, merchants or clergy, and were unskilled in growing food in England, let alone in the very different conditions of New England. They survived their fi rst months by raiding the graves and abandoned villages of natives who had already been decimated by European diseases. They would have perished utterly, like the colonists at Roanoke, had they not been fed and taught by the local Sachem of the Wampanoag, Massasoit.
While various tribes distinguished themselves from each other, most spoke a variant of the Algonquian language known as Massachusett, though a separate tribe by that name also existed (but not for long!). In this tongue the peoples of the New England coast called their home 'dawnland' and themselves the 'people of the fi rst light'. 
39
In one of history's numerous tragic ironies, the alliance Massasoit forged with the English actually enabled their colony to survive, thereby drawing ever more English settlers and ensuring the very destruction of his tribe that the great Sachem hoped to protect. Indeed, it proved utterly disastrous for all of New England's aboriginal peoples.

In the decade after 1620 thousands of English settlers arrived in the dawn land. Though the pact of friendship that Massasoit signed with the Plymouth colonists was to last for 50 years, the pressures brought to bear upon Indian lands by land hungry colonists proved to be its undoing. In yet another irony it would be Massasoit's son, Metacomet, who would wage full-scale war, unsuccessfully, against the people his father had saved.
As British colonists fl ooded into Massachusetts they quickly moved to areas north and south, coming into confl ict with other peoples, but also employing divisive tactics against traditionally competing tribes. Some whites sought to understand the Indians in their own terms, and more than a few lived with natives. Thomas Morton, who would later be shipped back to England in chains as punishment for living among the Massachusett, said 'I have found the Massachusetts Indians more full of humanity than the Christians.' But the most common response to white-Indian confl icts was increasing violence on the part of colonists.
Though Britons born only a century earlier would have understood the concept of land and resources held in common, the new ethic of individualism that was evolving among the British and new ideas of property made clashes all but inevitable. In New England, Puritanism gave special force to these new notions. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Puritanism was its doctrine of predestination. As is the case for most new cults, Puritans believed themselves to be 'a new chosen people' singled out by God with a divine mission to create a 'new Canaan', or 'new Jerusalem'. Perceiving only a 'howling wilderness', the 'Saints' (as they called themselves) believed their mission was to make the land into one 'fl owing with milk and honey', not seeing that this was already the case. As Cotton Mather, the foremost New England Puritan minister from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, declared: 'Here hath arisen light in darkness.' Taking their inspiration from the Old Testament Book of Joshua the Puritans also called the natives 'Amalekites', 'Amorites', or Philistines after the peoples of ancient Israel whom the Hebrews conquered and displaced. When the expedition against the Massachusett that resulted in Thomas Morton's imprisonment attacked their encampment at present day Quincy, a Puritan elder admonished John Endicott:
There are three thousand miles of wilderness behind these Indians, enough solid land to drown the sea from here to England. We must free our land of strangers, even if each mile is a marsh of blood. [emphasis added] It had taken only a few years for the Puritans to believe as an article of faith that the people whom they were dispossessing were the 'strangers'. For these self-styled Saints their doctrine of predestination informed them that individuals had been singled out for salvation even before they were born. This raised a diffi cult problem. How did members know they were among the saved? They resorted to circular reasoning. Their answer was that salvation was proved by the very fact that they belonged to the new community of the saved. Thus Puritanism as it fl ourished in the fi rst decades of British colonization was highly self-righteous and intolerant, not only of the Indians, who were deemed pagans and devil worshippers, but also of other Protestant sects, like the Quakers.
A doctrine-like predestination was a very thin reed upon which to build a faith, so Puritans also imagined more concrete manifestations of their divinely inspired destiny. As individuals garnered more land, and raised more livestock, or caught more fi sh, or stockpiled more lumber, then sold these commodities for profi t and in general became ever more prosperous, their very success became the needed evidence for the faith that they had been singled out for salvation. Achievement in material terms became the fundamental hallmark of God's blessing. Thus the drive to obtain land, show defi nitive evidence of prosperity and the accumulation of wealth became paramount. Just as enclosure became the norm in England so did the Puritans of New England begin to claim ever more and larger tracts of land, fencing them in and banning Indians from hunting or fi shing or otherwise using lands that had been traditionally open to all. Such radically different ideas about land, and the relationship of people to it, was enough to bring about violent confl ict. On one side land was the birthright of all, on the other land was to be held in private by individuals for their own use.
Of course this new belief system was at bottom a rationale and justifi cation for selfi shness, though its adherents believed intensely in their own rectitude. The Puritans who settled New England imposed an indelible stamp upon the later American self-conception. Their ideology took the form of religious doctrines (as did most ideas at the time) that claimed that God had singled them out as a 'New Chosen people' who were to establish a 'New Jerusalem' or 'New Zion' in the wilderness of America. They believed themselves to be among the elect, that is, those who were destined beyond question for an afterlife in heaven. What is most important is how they convinced themselves they were predestined to paradise.
Having sprung into existence as the result of the breakdown of traditional religious (Catholic) authority, and making their living in the new market economy which was very different from feudal agriculture, Puritans were highly infl uential in the development of the capitalist system, and the ideas which sustain it to this day. How did they know God favored them? Because they prospered; because they increased their wealth by trade, by investment and profi t. It followed from such logic that those who did not profi t were not among the elect and were estranged from God. In the old conception of religious community God wished people to aid each other. Now God helped those who helped themselves. Individualism would replace the collectivity and the clearest expression of God's favor was whether the individual prospered or sunk into poverty.
So ideas of private land ownership became wedded to religious doctrine, and dogma soon coupled with racism. Whatever attitudes about the Indians Puritans brought with them, the rapidly growing confl ict fed the inclination to envisage the natives as most defi nitely the 'unchosen people'. Indeed, they were scarcely seen as human. William Bradford, the second governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, wrote of his fi rst glimpse of the new world and could see only a 'hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and wild men'. The writings of the earliest Puritans are replete with images of the Indian as the 'spawn of Satan' or the 'devil's instruments'.
In 1636 a group of Niantic Indians killed a Briton off Block Island whom they accused of mistreating them. From Boston, Puritan leaders immediately conspired to revenge and sent an armed force to Rhode Island and Connecticut to engage in what they termed their fi rst 'war'. Because the Pequots were the most numerous tribe in the region, and had also recently killed British subjects trespassing on their territory, they became the main focus of attack. The band of Saints set out, in their own words 'to cut off remembrance of them from the earth'. Governor John Winthrop, who is still celebrated for his injunction to the Puritans of Boston 'to be as a city upon a hill', instructed his captains 'to put to death the men of Block island, but to spare the women and the children, and to bring them away, and to take possession of the island…' What actually transpired was Puritan New England's fi rst massacre of natives.
In reality the act of vengeance was merely a pretext to establish new colonies throughout Connecticut. As was the case throughout the Americas the Puritans had made promises to the tribal enemies of the Pequot, promising the Narragansett that for their assistance in removing their rivals the Puritans would take only Pequot land. Yet the removal of the Pequot did for the Connecticut Valley what the plague had done earlier in Massachusetts Bay. By removing one major tribal obstacle to their further colonization, the Puritans established a foothold that enabled them subsequently to suppress all the natives of the region, including, of course, the Narragansett.
The inexorable encroachment of the English upon traditional hunting grounds, and by cattle on native cornfi elds, fi nally led rival New England tribes to realize that their entire way of life was at stake. As one Narragansett sachem, Miantonomo, realizing too late that the English intended to take all native lands, put matters to his tribe:
So we are all Indians as the English are all English, and say brother to one another; so must we be one as they are, otherwise we shall be all gone shortly, for you know our fathers had plenty of deer and skins, our plains were full of deer, also our woods, and of turkies, and our coves full of fi sh and fowl. But these English have gotten our land, they with scythes cut down the grass, and with axes fell the trees; their cows and horses eat the grass, and their hogs spoil our clam banks, and we shall all be starved.

As tensions grew all over New England only a spark was needed to initiate a confl agration. Thus the fi rst true, all-encompassing war in British North America ensued, only a few generations after Massasoit had saved the fi rst Pilgrims from starvation, with devastating results for the colonists and virtual eradication for the Wampanoag, the Narragansett, the Mohegan and their other Amerindian allies. This war was far more destructive on a per capita basis than any other in American history. If the New England tribes had been able to persuade their western neighbors, the Mohawks, not to believe English promises that their lands would remain untouched, that English settlement would inevitably threaten them as well and to join their fellow natives, they might well have stopped English colonization entirely at that point. However, many tribes in the north and west were swayed to ally with the British, against their traditional rivals, eventually to succumb in exactly the same way. While truly horrifi c in intensity for the colonists, this fi rst colonial war resulted in total defeat for the New England natives and the extinction of their way of life.
The confl ict has come to be known as King Philip's War because colonists refused to call Massasoit's son, Metacomet, by his Algonquian name. The war began when Metacomet's brother, Wamsutta, died in mysterious fashion while being held captive by the English. When a Christianized and English-speaking Indian, who had probably served the British as a spy, was murdered subsequently, colonial leaders suspected Metacomet's hand. The English were blind to the true reasons for native resentment. As the Puritan divine, Increase Mather, was to write later, the Wampanoag killed the Indian 'out of hatred for him for his Religion, for he was Christianized, and baptiz'd, and was a Preacher amongst the Indians...and was wont to curb those Indians that knew not God on the account of their debauchereyes'. Aggression against Puritanism was not the cause of the war except in the sense that it provided the rationale for the English to assume racial and cultural superiority over the natives, and to justify taking their land. The colonial and imperial project was the true cause of native resentment and war.
As more Puritan settlers arrived the economic basis of the colony changed from dependence upon trading British steel and iron tools and other goods for fur, to a more intensive and environmentally destructive economy based on agriculture, fishing and timber harvesting. Newcomers insisted upon enforcing their own Puritan code of behavior and morality, criticizing the Indians for their lack of 'modest' dress and attempting to convert the natives as well. Massasoit had barred Puritans from attempting to convert natives but a fair number who became known as 'praying Indians' did adopt the immigrant religion and soon moved out of traditional villages and adopted the English way of life. Meanwhile Indians who strayed into what had formerly been their own fi elds and forests were arrested and jailed for trespassing. In only the span of two generations the Indians were becoming outsiders, strangers in their own land.
When three Wampanoag accused of murder were hanged at Plymouth the tribe rose up against the English. The war quickly spread into the far west of Massachusetts and down the Connecticut Valley. Half of the 90 English settlements were attacked and many wiped out. At the height of the war villages only ten miles from Boston were assaulted. Colonists were frustrated at not being able to draw Indians into a set-piece battle. Many English men were veterans of the Thirty Years War and were accustomed to battle in open territory. Indians, however, could not stand up to muskets and cannon and so resorted to ambush and other forms of guerrilla warfare, including raids on homesteads. As the ferocity of fi ghting increased so did atrocities on both sides leading to the murder of women and children and to the mutilation of bodies. The ritualistic stripping of British bodies by Indians, leaving them to lie naked, particularly offended Puritan sensibilities.

47
The very basis of their livelihood now appropriated by the colonists, the Wampanoag and Narragansett and other tribes had to adjust to English ways in order to survive at all, and rapidly seemed to disappear altogether. One measure of their precipitous decline was their loss of language. Cotton Mather, one of the most powerful religious leaders of the New England colonies after the war wrote that:
It is very sure the best thing we can do for our Indians is to Anglicize them…they can scarce retain their language, without a tincture of other savage inclinations, which do but ill suit, either with honor, or with the design of Christianity. 
48
It took the English years to recover and rebuild, but they did so, and from their new-found position of strength continued their subjugation of eastern North America. In the process of waging virtually incessant warfare with every native group, and testing their own identities against the 'devil's instruments', these English colonists were transforming themselves into a new breed: Americans. King Philip's War is little remembered in any detail today. Yet, the cultural effect in the memory of the Puritans and other English colonists was to imprint the natives' 'savagery' forever on future generations, omitting entirely the equal atrocities initiated by the English, and, indeed, what amounted to genocide. In American national mythology it was the 'good' Indians who made the fi rst Thanksgiving possible. In this sanctioned narrative it was the 'spawn of Satan' who trespassed upon Eden and despoiled the Puritan paradise, not the true strangers from across the sea. The 'elect of god' now enjoined themselves to establish their new promised land. The incontrovertible British design to take the North American continent from the people who already inhabited it was, and is, conveniently expunged from popular consciousness. French, Indians, Rebellion and Repression
Though there is a general dread of giving too much power to our governors, I think we are in more danger from too little obedience by the governed.
Benjamin Franklin (Weeks, 1996)   THE FIRST GLOBAL WAR PREFIGURES MORE GLOBAL WAR By the close of the seventeenth century British, French, and Spanish colonies had been fi rmly implanted in North America. The French dominated eastern Canada, the Spanish ruled Florida and the mouth of the Mississippi River as well as most of the south-west and California, and numerous British colonies ranged the Atlantic Piedmont from Maine to Georgia. The French claimed the vast Ohio River valley to the west of the Appalachian Mountains but the British were equally determined to claim it for themselves, especially as an outlet for a growing colonial population. Given that French policies aimed at dominating the European core, and Britain was equally adamant to prevent this, the two nations were already constantly at war. Once both had entered the race for overseas empire it was inevitable that their mutual warfare would extend across the globe. What Americans call the 'French and Indian War' is called by the British and French the 'Seven Years War'. It was the fi rst global war, 1756-1763, fought with other European allies, all competing for advantage in the global contest and ranging across North America, Europe, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, North Africa and Asia. While the war did not settle matters between the French and British on a worldwide scale, the British were victorious in North America, acquiring Canada and making claim to the territories between the Mississippi River and the Appalachians, a claim obviously not recognized by the numerous indigenous tribes of the region. The effort to wrest control of Canada, and to protect the British colonies to the south, virtually bankrupted the British treasury. It was in the aftermath of victory and insolvency that the British crown and Parliament decided to levy increased taxes upon their colonial subjects in America in order to pay for the costs of triumph. At this point the mutually opposite interests of British government offi cials and stockholders against those of colonial elites clashed. As British subjects who had benefi ted greatly from the expensive deployment of British troops, it seemed to the British that the colonials should have been willing to bear their fair share of the monetary costs, but this they were loathe to do, claiming that their losses in lives were payment enough. When the crown therefore imposed ever more fi nancial burdens by force the stage was set for armed confl ict between the colonials and their mother country. Out of this confl ict grew the demand for American independence.
While Puritans and their New England successors rationalized their conquests with religious ideology and claims of divine mission, most settlers in the other British colonies justifi ed their expansion with reference to the superiority of British civilization and practiced naked aggression. Britons had already routed the Scots, Welsh and Irish, whom they saw as inferior, and the new Anglo-Americans 1 simply took their right of conquest in North America for granted. If bellicose intent existed it was claimed to come from the other. Aggression was the charge leveled against the American natives trying desperately to hang on to their land and way of life. British colonial 'civilizationism' 2 also obsessed over 'security', ignoring the fact that British incursions into, and disruption of, ancient cultures fostered the very attacks they came so anxiously to fear. But the settlers justifi ed this state of affairs by claiming that if Anglo-Saxons did not seize the territory then the competition would. As noted, the British were latecomers to the game of empire and thus their relentless and rapid expansion in North America quickly brought them up against the French and Spanish who had got there fi rst, and, of course, the many indigenous tribes that had been there for millennia.
By the late seventeenth century a 'Glorious Revolution' had occurred in England that brought a good measure of power to the commercial middle classes, giving the House of Commons in Parliament considerably more authority, while weakening that of the king and landed nobility. In the process a great deal of intellectual energy was released. Treatises on politics and society abounded, such as those of John Locke, arguing a new philosophy of 'natural rights', and these ideas percolated throughout the British social structure, with the result that ordinary British citizens, including those at the bottom of the hierarchy, began to develop a new sense of their own individuality and right to liberty. Liberty meant not having to live at the sufferance of others and that meant having property. The primary measure of property was still land, and most of that was already claimed in England. But the vast bulk of North America was still up for grabs. While most of the early colonists would indenture themselves as servants to the wealthy in order to gain passage to America, their terms of servitude would be limited, if harsh, and they had every hope of achieving personal independence by settling the rapidly expanding frontiers of the British Empire. Once this autonomy had been achieved, most quickly adopted the characteristics and outlook of 'free born' Britons. They asserted a self-evident right to foster the extension of that empire and they pushed westward implacably.
After the initial setbacks were overcome, when the natives of New England and the Chesapeake and deeper south were defeated, an immense surge of immigration took place from the late seventeenth to the mid eighteenth century. While there were some aristocrats who immigrated, and others who aped their manners, most British subjects interacted with each other without the deference expected in England. In the American colonies Britons could escape subordination and pauperism. As Adam Smith put it, there 'was more equality among the English colonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country'. 
3
Just as the original colonies of Virginia and Plymouth were fostered by joint-stock companies, so prominent landowners and merchants in both these colonies, and the others that had been established, created such companies themselves to exploit the lands west to the Appalachian Mountains. Many states like Massachusetts and Virginia claimed everything west to the Pacifi c Ocean! 
4
It is often forgotten that most American colonists just prior to the revolution considered themselves British citizens, even more British than the British. Empire was rapidly becoming a way of life for England and the vanguard of this imperialism were those busy colonizing America and defending British frontiers. While the Puritan Revolution had been defeated and its rigidity had diminished, the English still took the religious superiority of their various Protestant faiths seriously, and gloried in British citizenship. For them there was no difference between Old England and New.
England's perennial clash with France intensified after the Glorious Revolution when power at the London court passed to men committed to crafting a vast maritime empire that historians call mercantilism: the transfer of wealth to the mother country in the early stage of modern capitalism. Colonies existed to enrich the metropolis, not primarily to benefi t the colonists themselves. Thus, a collision developed between the American colonials' idea of empire, acquiring territory, and London's goal of maritime supremacy. At all times, however, British authorities calculated the advantage over France (and Spain as well, though the Spanish empire in the Americas was already on the wane). London wished to clear both rivals from the Caribbean islands and thereby assert primacy over the entire Atlantic. New France's empire in North America was larger in area, but considerably smaller in power than her enemy's, and centered largely on trade with natives, not colonization. While England controlled the eastern coastal region, France claimed the area surrounding English colonies to the north and west, and the vast area from the great lakes down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans. Given the scale of British immigration, however, Britons soon vastly outnumbered the French in North America. 
5
The natives in the region bestriding or west of the Appalachian chain, like the Iroquois, Seneca, Delaware, Cherokee, Creek and others, retained their unity and strength. Those who lived between both the English and the French, like the Huron, tended to favor the French simply because they did not alter the environment and destroy the Indian way of life. One Indian leader put it this way: Brethren, are you ignorant of the difference between our Father (the French) and the English? Go and see the forts our Father has created, and you will see that the land beneath their walls is still hunting ground…whilst the English, on the contrary, no sooner get possession of a country than the game is forced to leave, the trees fall down before them, the earth becomes bare. 
6
One of the chief colonial proponents of imperial expansion at the expense of France and the natives was Benjamin Franklin: I have long been of the opinion that the foundations of the future grandeur and stability of the British Empire lies in America… Britain itself will become vastly more populous…the Atlantic sea will be covered with your trading ships, and your naval power will…awe the world.
He asserted further, 'Already in the old colonies many thousands of families are ready to swarm, wanting more land.' 
7
The war in North America quickly led to naval engagements in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and Asia. Thus the Seven Years War was the fi rst truly global war which foreshadowed ever more destructive wars and signaled the degree to which imperial rivalries would shape the future of the planet. In this early stage of worldwide struggle for supremacy, unconventional methods of warfare would fi rst make their appearance. Warfare in the forests of America did not suit the tactics practiced by professional soldiers on either side, who simply formed ranks en masse in open areas and fi red at each other almost at point-blank range. Though they had roundly condemned such practices when they had been employed against them, American colonists quickly adopted the guerrilla tactics of the Indians whom they recruited as allies against the French and the tribes that lined up with them. They would do so again when the time came to face their British cousins.
The earliest contact between Europeans and natives involved the fur trade. Indians were happy to provide pelts in return for more durable European tools and weapons, which clearly improved native material prosperity. But this new commercial relationship also altered Indian ways of life and undermined traditional culture and spiritual values. Competition between English and French traders also caused competition to develop between tribes and gradually forced them to choose sides, drawing natives 'into a market economy where their trading partners gradually became trading masters'. 
8
The presence of the French and their native allies in Canada and the Mississippi Valley were the obstacle to British colonial advancement into the west, and thus, while colonial spokesmen like Franklin insisted their support of the war was simply patriotism, it was in fact naked self-interest. London deployed 40,000 troops to North America and with the added support of colonial militias waged war on a scale never before seen on the continent. France was forced to cede Canada and the Mississippi Valley and most possessions in the Caribbean. While Spain was given New Orleans, it gave up much of Florida to English control. Thus the colonists believed that land was opened up to settlement. Speculators rushed to make their claims. Throughout the war merchants luxuriated in military contracts for food, uniforms and ships. British colonists who did not volunteer for military service, or who were not dragooned, enjoyed record employment opportunities and high wages. The French and Indian War appeared to have resulted in all that the colonists desired.
There was bound to be a down side and there was. Human losses were astounding for the era. Muster lists for Boston, for example, indicate that virtually all working-class families contributed soldiers. In a town that then counted only 2,000 families, 700 men perished. 
9
In return for the aid of their Indian allies British authorities had promised them a 'racial boundary' that would preserve western lands for various tribes. The Proclamation of 1763 ordered all colonial subjects then living in the west to withdraw east of the Appalachians and forbade further British emigration beyond the line. Needless to say the colonial subjects ignored the edict and tensions began to simmer between the crown, Anglo-Americans and natives, both those who had aided the British and those who sided with the French.
The British crown also wanted colonists to pay their fair share of the costs of war. Despite all the advantages that accrued to Anglo-Americans they quickly renounced any responsibility for it. In a speech to the House of Commons in 1766 Franklin essentially falsifi ed recent history, repudiated his own previous grandiose pronouncements and claimed the war had not been fought for colonial interests at all but was a 'British war', in which the colonists had 'no particular concern or interest'. Since Parliament could not allow Americans 'to benefi t from Britain's protection without contributing anything in return' 10 it shortly began to levy deeply unpopular taxes and imposed 'intolerable' acts upon the colonists leading many to assert that their rights as free-born Englishmen were being violated. The British government was impairing their liberties and reducing them to 'slaves'.

In the United States the American Revolution is celebrated as a near impossible victory over a mighty and tyrannical empire made possible by the heroism of those who introduced the concept of equality and self-government into a benighted world. The revolutionary generation took terrible risks. Only a few short years before they were shining exemplars of British citizenship but after 1776 they were committing treason. Had the crown not been so preoccupied with continental threats from France the real strength of imperial Britain would had been deployed, instead of inept commanders and foreign mercenaries. The colonial rebels would have been trounced and Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton et al. would have swung from the gallows, their names mere footnotes to history today. But luck and circumstances were with the new republic.
'All men are created equal' are, as everyone knows, Thomas Jefferson's words. Even though the Founders exiled all Africans from the very ranks of human beings, Jefferson's words did not even apply to the majority of white men in the colonies at the time. The signers of the Declaration of Independence and the US constitution selected themselves as representatives of 'We the People' but acted primarily in their own interests. Virtually all of them were plantation owners and slaveholders, or had extensive commercial and banking interests, and all feared genuine popular democracy. When Jefferson also wrote in the Declaration that all men are entitled to the 'pursuit of happiness' he was paraphrasing the British philosopher John Locke, whose ideas were widespread among all colonial classes. In late eighteenth-century America, happiness was identical to the possession of property because property enabled the individual to be free of subjection. Independence meant selfsustenance, not servitude. Those who failed to prosper were judged to be indolent, or incompetent, and certainly not fi t to govern. The most widespread form of property was land and there was land aplenty in North America. If Jefferson's 'empire of liberty' was to exist it could only do so if the troublesome natives were removed and, by 1776, if the British could be prevented from interfering with the pursuit of land and profi t.
Most emigrants from the British Isles left because they had no land or any other property and desired above all to acquire some. Most had to indenture themselves, to commit to servitude under others for a time in order to buy their passage to the colonies, but the promise of land and profi t thereafter became the animating motive of colonists. Many of the founders had invested in companies that bought cheap land west of the Appalachian Mountains before the British had attempted to put a stop to western settlement in deference to their Indian allies against the French. Their speculative plans to sell this land at a signifi cant profi t to the restive mass of immigrants in the eastern cities was at risk, even as their own fortunes dwindled from the imposition of the hated taxes.
Colonies had also established their own money to facilitate trade. When the British demanded payment of taxes or duties in pounds sterling or gold sovereigns the local currencies were devalued and the overall colonial economy was impoverished. Middling businessmen could no longer obtain credit to build their enterprises. Those colonists whose futures were limited as wage earners in the east also realized that continued taxation would limit job growth and keep wages lower. So a community of interest had built among all classes against the British. But the American elite had the most to gain. Many American colonists, probably a third, rejected rebellion and remained loyal to Britain. In what was really a civil war they were persecuted and killed and their properties confi scated. Many fl ed to Canada or the Caribbean. Franklin's own son remained a loyalist and the father never spoke to his son again.
In the fi rst blush of rebellion many rushed to volunteer. But leaving farms and shipyards entailed great sacrifi ce so recruitment and retention soon proved problematic. Unable to pay troops in hard currency the Continental congress issued 'scrip' or promissory notes, or entitlements to western land should victory be theirs. But promises did not send money home to wives and children, so the majority of revolutionary soldiers sold their scrip to bankers and speculators at usurious discounts for currencies that could purchase necessities. They also sold their notes to western land. Thus they were never paid the full value of their service, and as the war went on their families, farms and small businesses fell further into debt. One revolutionary soldier's narrative spoke for most:
When those who engaged to serve in the war enlisted, they were promised a hundred acres of land, each, which was to be in their own or adjoining states. When the country had drained the last drop of service it could screw out of the poor soldiers, they were turned adrift like worn-out horses, and nothing said about land to pasture them upon. 
13
The British declared that all slaves fi ghting on their side would be freed. Since colonial opposition to the crown was not universal and recruitment and retention in the continental army proved problematic when the rigors of extended war became apparent, slaves were dragooned. Some Americans recognized the irony of fi ghting for liberty with slaves and suggested that those on the American side should be freed as well. But southern leaders objected strenuously, fearing slave rebellions more than defeat. 
14
For the fact is that most of the Founders feared democracy as surely as any monarchist. To them the great mass of common people were the 'mob', stupid and drunken, incapable of self-governance owing to their ignorance.
Thus a 'republic' in which the choice of governing offi cials would be limited strictly to the prosperous and propertied was the only option for them. Though they rejected monarchy, they embraced the principle of representative and divided government and strictly limited suffrage. The US Senate and House of Representatives were clearly modeled on Britain's Houses of Lords and Commons. The upper chamber had the power of veto over the lower and would thus serve as a brake on any perceived radicalism. So the American revolution was not really a revolution. It was a rebellion that was fortunate to win and while it instituted key reforms and unique adaptations, such as a written constitution and a Bill of Rights, it was really a transfer of power from the British government to an American self-selected elite who ensured that governance would be held by them. When they spoke of equality, by no means did they mean 'all'. Yet by articulating this ideal they had let the proverbial genie loose and the democratic ideal would soon gather a life of its own, thence to bedevil future generations of the ruling elites.
The US constitution was established to foster centralized government with the power to tax and raise an army. Many American historians assert that the American revolution fostered 'universalist' values and principles that were intended to enlighten a benighted and backward world. The founders intended this only in the most limited sense. Just as the British nobility had opposed the rise of the commercial middle classes to power, so did the new ruling class oppose the political participation of the commoners, and this was just as true in America as in Britain. The proof was not long coming.
In 1786 a rebellion broke out in western Massachusetts that, more than any other event, spurred the American elite to write the US constitution and centralize power in their hands. Veterans of the revolution had returned to their farms only to fi nd them in disarray and burdened with debt and taxation that they viewed as unjust, since many did not meet the property qualifi cations to vote. In Massachusetts property qualifi cations had increased and hence many were being taxed without representation!

The hypocrisy of so many of those who initiated the revolution is clearly illustrated by their response to this upsurge of popular democracy against similar injustices perpetrated by the new domestic ruling class and the governments they controlled. Samuel Adams, an icon of the revolution, now condemned men he had inspired to rebellion who were resisting the very sort of 'taxation without representation' and tyranny that he had denounced. Adams claimed that British agents were fomenting treason and as a member of the new ruling class drew up legislation that suspended the age-old Anglo-American rule of habeas corpus and, making a distinction between rebellion in a republic and a monarchy, called for the execution of the Shaysites.

All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The fi rst are the rich and well-born, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the fi rst class a distinct permanent share in the government.

Most of the 55 self-selected men who drew up the constitution were lawyers; most of their wealth was in the form of land, slaves, manufacturing or shipping; half of them had money loaned out at interest and 40 owned government bonds. All represented their fellow citizens of wealth and were intent on protecting property and wealth and 'to repress domestic faction and insurrection'.

All American schoolchildren learn early of the sanctity of the Bill of Rights. Few learn that these fi rst ten amendments to the original constitution were opposed by most of the original framers. The document issued in 1789 had omitted to ascribe rights of free speech, assembly, trial by jury of peers, freedom from arbitrary search and seizure and many others precisely because they did not want the common people to exercise them. But opposition to the ratifi cation was so deep that promises of the later amendments had to be made or the constitution might have been rejected. Thus did the genie of democracy work its spell. While the universal right to vote was not among the new rights extolled, the ones that were enumerated were suffi cient to lead many to believe that they were genuine citizens and not mere subjects. This would have far reaching consequences.
The Founders had made one thing very clear. The threat to liberty came primarily from vested government, though once that power was in their hands they deemed it sacrosanct. But the lesson was absorbed by those who had borne the brunt of distress and sacrifi ce in the revolution. The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States providing for the right to bear arms was instituted as a defense against the new government's potential to replicate the tyranny of the crown. Armed militias would provide a counterweight to the standing army should that be employed against the people, as the British army had been. Since that time numerous legal cases have ruled that this right is embodied in the National Guard and since that agency can be federalized the original intent has been nullifi ed. It was one thing for popular eruption to create the US; it was another if similar upheavals were to contest the decisions of the new American governing class.
No sooner had the Bill of Rights been adopted than the Whiskey Rebellion broke out in western Pennsylvania and spread to Virginia. The new Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, and Congress lost no time in exercising the newly established power to tax. The justifi cation was to draw down the national debt but Hamilton also wished to impose taxes 'more as a measure of social discipline than as a source of revenue'.

Hard currency was scarce in this rural region and farmers could not easily get their corn to eastern markets, so they usually converted corn they could not sell or barter to whisky. Often the whisky itself served as a medium of exchange. Congress levied taxes on all distillers but the larger industrial producers (George Washington was the largest) were charged rates signifi cantly lower than small farmers. Since voting rights were limited by property qualifi cations many small farmers could not vote and saw imposition of the tax in much the same terms as did colonists at the time of the Stamp Act. As in Shays' Rebellion many of the whisky rebels were veterans of the revolution and their issue was taxation without representation and the clear bias in favor of the wealthy.
By the summer of 1795, civil protests became armed rebellion. As word of the upheaval spread across state lines tax collectors were assaulted and resistance took other forms such as robbing the mail and stopping court proceedings. With Shays' Rebellion still fresh in their minds Washington and Hamilton declared martial law and themselves led the new army of the United States into the west to crush the rebels. The fi rm precedent was established. Though the United States itself had come into existence by armed rebellion, the new national government would not tolerate the same from Americans. The unintended result channeled popular frustration at the biased power exercised in the capital toward universal suffrage, a fundamental right not fully recognized in law until 1964.
With the spirit of rebellion temporarily squashed the elites turned their attention toward the shape of the economy. American settlement by Britons had from the start been a profi t-making enterprise and citizens of the new nation were as committed to pecuniary self-advancement as ever. Though the Founders feared 'faction', political differences were inevitable. Thus two main camps and two different visions emerged. Jefferson imagined the vast continent fi lling up with independent 'yeoman' farmers, while Hamilton envisioned a strong centralized industrial and commercial economy, a central bank and an army of wage earners to serve it. To the Jeffersonians, Hamilton's system seemed too closely akin to Britain's but the Federalists understood that continued upper-class control would require greater centralization. Only that would enable the US eventually to out-compete Britain. Since the age of the self-dependent yeoman was over, and an increasingly global market was the focus of all production -agricultural as well as industrial -the result of the split between the Hamiltonian Federalists and Democratic-Republican Jeffersonians was a system that combined both conceptions. The vast American hinterland would be opened up to agricultural enterprise producing for eastern and European markets, while the American cities would evolve around banking, trade and manufacture. But fi rst the west would have to be won.
Wage war and call it self-defense.
Fisher Ames, 1798 (Ames et al., 1854)   What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic studded with cities, towns and prosperous farms…? Andrew Jackson, Second Inaugural Address, 1830 (US Government, 2001)   Now that the restive lower orders were contained, the political elites of the new nation set about fostering a sense of nationalism that they saw as necessary to channel popular frustration that would otherwise be directed at them. Jefferson's espousal of a republic, based on widespread ownership of land by a self-sustaining independent class of small farmers constituting the great majority, is still seen as the fi rst great advocacy of popular democracy, yet the vast majority of people could not vote, including most white males.
Hamilton and his fellow Federalists feared the growth of Jefferson's 'yeomanry' and knew the day was not far off when its white, male members would demand suffrage, and with it perhaps overturn the aristocrat's grasp on power and destroy the Hamiltonian goal of an industrial society with centralized banking and control of money. So, expansion was necessary to Democrats and Federalists alike in order to provide the growing white population with at least a small stake of property in the new system. The new nationalism would be based on whipped up fears of foreign plots both to contain Americans and deprive them of their vaunted birthright. The result would be aggression turned outward toward the native peoples and the imported slaves.
Though American independence could not have been won without the alliance with France, the new Federalist government soon waged undeclared war against its former benefactor. The French monarchy was overthrown in 1789 and many Americans initially viewed this event as a replication of the American revolution. However, Federalists viewed revolutionary France, and its radical call for democracy, as a threat to established order. They feared the infection would penetrate the United States.
Because conditions there were vastly different than those that obtained in the US, the French revolution became self-destructive, eventually leading to military dictatorship under Napoleon Bonaparte, who proceeded to conquer much of Europe and renew war with Britain.
Despite the recent animosities between the two nations, most Federalists remained Anglophiles and understood that their own wealth and power depended mainly on trade with their former rulers. As Hamilton put it: 'I have always preferred a connexion with [Great Britain] to any other country, we think in English, and have a similarity of prejudices and predilections.' Meanwhile the French sought to cut off trade between Britain and the former colonies, while the British seized American vessels bound for France. The continued Franco-American alliance would deprive the US of the one market that sustained it. Although President Washington had declared American neutrality, many members of his administration, especially Hamilton, plotted to ally with England and to seek its favor mainly to expand into the west. The treaty signed by Chief Justice John Jay won agreement from Britain to withdraw from forts in the Northwest Territory, thereby opening up that land for settlement. In response to what they saw as a repudiation of their alliance the French now seized American vessels. The erstwhile enemy was now ally, the former confederate a bitter adversary.

Deliberately instilling xenophobia and drawing attention to the large number of immigrants not of English ancestry, the Federalists under the second president, John Adams, passed a new Naturalization Act increasing the time required for citizenship from fi ve to 14 years. The Alien Act enabled the president to arrest and jail or deport the 25,000 French who resided in the US, or any other of the foreign born who dissented. Most chilling of all was the Sedition Act that effectively nullifi ed the First Amendment to the constitution and led to the arrest of numerous journalists and editors who voiced opposition to the war with France. They were condemned as traitors. These measures, coming so soon after passage of the Bill of Rights, were an overt attempt to invalidate it and revealed how deeply many of the Framers opposed popular dissent and democracy itself, especially when the issue was war or peace. Their counterparts in every subsequent era of American history would enact similar measures intended to cow the voice of popular opposition, right up to the present.
In 1800 the French, faced with enormous casualties and attempting to suppress slave rebellion in Haiti, agreed to remunerate the US for its shipping losses, thereby undercutting the war hawks, who had grown so unpopular that Jefferson ascended to the presidency that year. Termination of the war turned out to be a stroke of good luck for Jefferson's vision because he would not have been able to 'purchase' the vast Louisiana Territory only three years later otherwise. The French had forced the Spanish to 'retrocede' Louisiana (France had turned it over to Spain in 1763 to avoid losing it to Britain after the Seven Years War) and Napoleon, in need of funds, 'sold' the region for $15 million.

War between France and England spread to other European states and proved a boon to the infant US in other respects. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the US became 'a world class commercial power'.

Also, at that moment, the new American nation intervened for the fi rst time directly into the affairs of another. Pointedly, this involved what would later come to be known as the Middle East.
The quasi-war with France had spurred the creation of the American navy and a new threat led to its buildup. 'Barbary pirates' were seizing and enslaving merchants and sailors in the Mediterranean and then holding them for ransom. With insurance rates increasing and profi ts diminishing Jefferson soon deployed warships to counter these predations. By 1804 almost the entire navy was in the Mediterranean. In 1805 the American consul in Tunis asked for permission from Jefferson to overthrow its ruler and replace him with another more inclined to US interests. Secretary of State James Madison deplored meddling in 'the domestic contests of other countries' but decided the cause was just and approved the exploit. 'Jefferson took a Hamiltonian pleasure in the way his military venture had earned the respect of European great powers.'

We shall be obliged to drive them [natives] with the beasts of the forest into the Stony Mountains.
Thomas Jefferson, 1808
I see not how the Indians could have been treated with more equity or humanity than they have been in general in North America.
Whether the whites won the land by treaty, by armed conquest, or both...mattered little so long as the land was won...all men of sane and wholesome thought must dismiss with contempt the plea that these continents should be reserved for the use of a few scattered savages whose life was a few degrees less meaningless, squalid, and ferocious than that of the wild beasts. Theodore Roosevelt, The Winning of the West, Vol. IV
In his private correspondence Jefferson often indicated a paternalistic concern for the fate of the American natives, usually claiming that their best interests would be served by abandoning their traditional ways and assimilating into what he clearly believed was a superior civilization. In letters to native leaders he would call them 'my sons' and their peoples his 'children'; to whites he would claim that 'in body and mind' the native was 'equal to the white man'. But as was the case with his anti-slavery pronouncements, hypocrisy lurked just below the surface. All Americans know that the native peoples of the Americas were largely displaced but little attention is paid to the methods. Just as Indian lands in the seventeenth century were 'expropriated through trickery, legal manipulation, intimidation, deportation, concentration camps, and murder', so the model continued, becoming, in short, the prototype of what is now condemned by the US as 'ethnic cleansing'.

When the Louisiana Territory was obtained Jefferson wanted to see the Chickasaws of the south-eastern states removed to the farthest west, though they had been among the few tribes to take the American side in the revolution. Jefferson claimed that there were no other tribes in the west, ignoring both differences in climate and geography that would utterly disrupt Chickasaw way of life and the fact that they would then come into confl ict with the Plains tribes. Alarmed that white settlers were pouring into both the Northwest territories and Louisiana Territory, a number of Indian leaders like Tecumseh attempted to bring about a confederacy of the many tribes in resistance. To this Jefferson responded:
We too are preparing for war against those, and only those who shall seek it, and if we are ever constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we shall never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated, or driven beyond the Mississippi. In war, they will kill some of us; we shall destroy all of them.

With Florida completely surrounded by the United States, the Spanish had every reason to think that their claim would be the next to be absorbed. While many high school texts refer to the acquisition of Florida as a 'purchase', it was brought about by a man who would become the most bellicose president in US history, Andrew Jackson. Born of Scots-Irish ancestry in the Appalachian region of North Carolina that was fi ercely contested between whites and natives, Jackson was orphaned by the age of 13 and suffered brutal wounds at the hands of the British during the revolution. These traumatic experiences left him with an implacable hatred of the Indians and the British, and a desire for vengeance that he exercised without mercy. Climbing in southern society to become a land speculator and slave trader at the very moment the invention of the cotton gin caused the explosion of cotton as the prime plantation crop, Jackson yearned above all to cleanse the region of those he considered savages, though his own rages led him to knife fi ghts and to engage in a number of pistol duels, killing one man. (The 'gin' derives from 'engine'. This was a revolutionary invention by Eli Whitney in 1794 that enabled slaves to remove the seeds from cotton much faster and in more bulk than they could previously do by hand.) When escaped slaves and members of various tribes sought refuge in Spanish-held Florida among the Seminoles, Jackson took it upon himself to invade the area. Though his actions were condemned by President Monroe and his Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, their rhetoric was largely diplomatic camoufl age. They wished to annex Florida too and were perfectly happy for a rogue to accomplish it. Realizing they would lose the land anyway the Spanish then sold it to the US. Jackson became the territory's fi rst governor.
Jackson had become the nation's fi rst military hero since Washington because of his decisive defeat of the British during the war of 1812. Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans actually came after the peace treaty between Britain and the US had been signed, but communications by sea delayed the message. As during the revolution, Britain's best troops were pre-occupied with France. Had the full might of England been brought to bear the outcome would have been very different. Every American war aim failed. Most land battles were lost, though some naval engagements passed into legend, and the hysterical clamor for war reinforced what was already a growing sectionalism between North and South. Indeed, New Englanders even contemplated secession, long before the Confederacy of 1861. Boston merchants continued to trade with their prime partners, the British, even as war commenced. While a pugnacious nationalism emerged, it was also balanced by an equally assertive sectionalism. The very solidarity of the Union was weakened.

Many Americans accused the British of arming Indians in the West to block their westward migration. As tensions mounted the British continued to seize vessels and impress American sailors into their own navy. Certain Federalists were suspected of secret dealings in order to rejoin with Britain. The war hawks who carried the day desired material benefi ts but their words showed little hint of anything more than 'national honor'. President Madison declared that 'To have shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance would have been a degradation...' In the manner typical of the war hawk who himself will bear no cost of war but only its benefi ts, Senator Henry Clay asserted that the greatest boon would be 'the reproduction and cherishing of a martial spirit among us', and added: But I prefer the troubled ocean of war, demanded by the honor and independence of the country, with all its calamities and desolations, to the tranquil, putrescent pool of ignominious peace.
Despite the language of honor the underlying motive was land hunger. By a slim margin Congress voted for war.
Americans celebrate this war in the words of their national anthem, the 'Star-spangled banner'. But the British burned to the ground the new capital at Washington and forced President Madison to fl ee for his life. The attempted annexation of both Canada and East Florida were disasters. For the British the affair was a sideshow to their war with France and would not have come about (and it scarcely fi gures in their history).
But for Americans who now poured into the West, the second war against the most powerful empire, by not ending in re-subjugation, was perceived as a glorious victory and vindication of a new order. The new 'American system' was acclaimed as the vanguard of human progress, thus lending license to an exultant and belligerent nationalism that propelled settlement of the Louisiana Territory and would lead to uncompromising demands for more land and infl uence beyond its boundaries. As Clay put matters, the US now had the 'power to create a system of which we shall be the centre' and added that America would become 'the place of deposit of the commerce of the world'. 
10
Though the first of the American pronouncements known as 'doctrines' bears the name of James Monroe, it was formulated by John Quincy Adams. Unlike his fellow New Englanders, many of whom regretted the break with England, Adams was a committed nationalist with a grand vision of America's future, one that had no room for Britain. Like his Puritan forebears he believed that God had appointed the US to civilize the New World. Anticipating the doctrine of 'Manifest Destiny' he said as early as 1811, 'The whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one nation, speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles.'

So, instead of a joint declaration the US government issued the Monroe Doctrine unilaterally and proclaimed audaciously that the western hemisphere was no longer open for European colonization. American effrontery was remarkable in the face of British power. The United States could by no means militarily enforce its claim and it had no standing in domestic or international law. The British shortly repudiated the doctrine by establishing a new colony in the Falkland Islands. But the upstart nation had asserted that it would do what it insisted Europeans could not. It would continue territorial acquisition and it seemed to avow that it would one day dominate the hemisphere.
As Spain's western hemispheric colonies struggled for independence the US extended rhetorical support. But most Americans viewed Catholics in Latin America as backward 'papists' who were incapable of the virtues of liberty and self-government characteristic of Anglo-Americans. All Spanish territories, moreover, possessed large numbers of natives who were deemed utterly inferior. When Mexico achieved independence the US formally congratulated its neighbor but the new nation also claimed lands that many in the US insisted were part of the Louisiana Purchase. In any case, the legalistic argument over Mexico's border hid deeper desires among Americans to seize a great deal more than the region known as Texas.
The agricultural and industrial prosperity of the United States were two sides of the same coin. As a result of mechanical improvements, and above all, slave labor, cotton had become the most important export crop throughout the South. It was also a vital commodity necessary to textile manufacturers and the workers they employed in New England and other areas of the North. While the movement to abolish slavery was strongest in the North, even there most Americans believed that the 'peculiar institution' was vital to continued profi ts and employment. The American farmer, north or south, whether producing cotton or corn for export, did so as part of a growing market system and therefore required more and more land to profi t in that system. Enormous pressures were in place to settle the western continent beyond the boundaries of the Louisiana Territories. Profi ts engendered by slave-based cotton production were so great that representatives of the slavocracy demanded that south-western lands be acquired to spread that source of wealth.
But much land in the Deep South was still held by natives. Jefferson had been the fi rst president to call for the removal of Indians but it was not carried out until the 1830s. Historians refer to the 'Age of Jackson' as the period when demands by lower class white men for the right to vote were led and met by a president who stood for full democracy against the privilege of entrenched aristocratic power. While it is true that universal white male suffrage was obtained during this era, most of those who obtained it were no more democratic than their opponents. White men still barred women and every non-white from exercising the same right. Now that their votes were needed by both parties they could exact pressure on federal and state governments to confer advantage on them. The benefi t most sought was the land of those Indians who held title to it by treaty. Jackson was the most prominent voice calling to shred these treaties.
The governor of Georgia stated fl atly that treaties 'were expedients by which ignorant, intractable, savage peoples were induced without bloodshed to yield up what civilized people had a right to possess'.

Anglo-Saxonism was coming into full bloom. A senator from Virginia put matters in unmistakable terms:
It is peculiar to the character of this Anglo-Saxon race of men to which we belong, that it has never been contented to live in the same country with any other distinct race, upon terms of equality; it has, invariably, when placed in that situation, proceeded to exterminate or enslave the other race in some form or other, or, failing that to abandon the country.

Polk claimed to be 're-annexing' Texas, asserting falsely that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase. At the same time he called for the 're-occupation' of Oregon though the US had never occupied it in the fi rst place. By this time many prominent northern intellectuals and religious fi gures were openly supporting abolition but that did not mean they opposed expansion. Polk and his followers believed that by including Oregon they would mollify northerners concerned about slavery's expansion in the south-west. Northerners and southerners alike desired the ports of San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. Abolitionism, noble as it was, was far outpaced by a virulent racial nationalism claiming scientifi c evidence that melded into the doctrine of 'Manifest Destiny'. While the phrase itself is attributed to an obscure newspaper editor, the ideology was already in wide circulation.
Well before the nation of Germany came into existence the roots of Nazi race theories were being set in the United States, and for the same reasons. New pseudo-sciences of phrenology and 'craniology', in response to abolitionism, focused on claims of African inferiority, but were also put to use rationalizing the conquest of Mexico and native peoples. These ideas were paralleled by the ever more popular doctrine of 'Anglo-Saxonism'.

Both Mexico and the United States had recognized the Nueces River as their common border but now Polk insisted that the boundary was the Rio Grande, about 150 miles to the south. He sent a large American force under General Zachary Taylor to that river while also sending an emissary to Mexico City to 'resolve' the issue diplomatically, fully realizing that Mexico would not simply sign away its territory. All that remained was to wait for an incident that could then be used to justify war. It was not long in coming. On April 25,  1846 an American patrol was ambushed by Mexican forces and 16 soldiers were killed, the rest wounded and captured. Polk had his pretext. He declared that 'Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood on American soil.' War, 'notwithstanding all our efforts to avoid it, exists by the acts of Mexico herself'.

Only two members of Congress voted against war. One of them, Joshua Giddings of Ohio, labeled it 'an aggressive, unholy, and unjust war'. Later, after war had been declared, he also refused to vote funds for the war, saying that 'In the murder of Mexicans upon their own soil, or in robbing them of their country, I can take no part either now or hereafter. The guilt of these crimes must rest on others -I will not participate in them.'

Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of the leading intellectual proponents of the supposedly humane philosophy of Transcendentalism, passively opposed the war but said little and clearly counted himself among the manifest destinarians:
It is very certain that the strong British race, which has now overrun so much of this continent, must also overrun that tract [Texas], and Mexico and Oregon also, and it will in the course of the ages be of small import by what particular occasions and methods it was done.

The cost to Mexico was enormous. At least 50,000 died as opposed to about 11,000 Americans (the vast majority to yellow fever and other diseases, not combat) and it lost half of its territory. Many of Mexico's art treasures from its long history were looted as well. Years later Ulysses S. Grant regretted the role he had played as a young offi cer. 'I had the horror of the Mexican War…only I had not moral courage enough to resign.'

Jay Cooke, Wall Street baron, 1877 (LaFeber, 1980)   This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations… John Hay, 1886 (LaFeber, 1980)
God has not been preparing the English-speaking and Teutonic peoples for a thousand years for nothing but vain and idle self admiration. No, he has made us the master organizers of the world… Senator Albert Beveridge, 1899 (LaFeber, 1980)   NOT FIGHTING TO FREE SLAVES
The Civil War is taught in American primary and secondary schools in such a way as to leave children with the impression that it was fought primarily to free the slaves. Nothing is further from the truth. While the issue of slavery was the underlying cause of the war, the principal issue before the nation when Lincoln was elected in 1860 was whether slavery should be limited to the regions where it already existed, not its abolition. Most shipwrights from Massachusetts, farmers in Pennsylvania or blacksmiths from Indiana did not enlist in the Union Army to free slaves but rather to preserve the Union above all. Until that problem of disunion was resolved, the Civil War would bring a halt to expansion while the nation rent itself asunder. Abraham Lincoln chose to wage war against the secessionist Confederacy to emphasize his commitment to the Union and so did hundreds of thousands of northerners who volunteered rather than see the nation split in two. From the beginning of the American experiment the founders had desired to see the nascent republic dominate the entire hemisphere and most political and economic elites thereafter also earnestly pursued this goal. The rapid expansion of the US across 3,000 miles of territory, from 'sea to shining sea', in a mere 67 years (1781-1848) testifi es to that, and on the eve of the Civil War the US had already initiated inroads into the Pacifi c, Asia and Central America. Northern industrial and fi nancial interests were also dependent upon southern cotton and the vast profi ts the crop engendered, and the black slave labor upon which it all relied. The loss of these to a new independent nation would have weakened the position of the US against its principal commercial rival, Britain, which was more than happy to have its challenger torn apart. The breakup of the United States, had secession been allowed by Lincoln's administration, would have strengthened the already formidable hand of Britain in the Caribbean and South America, and destroyed any hope of achieving the American goal of hemispheric dominance. Union was an absolute necessity to carry out the primary goals for which the United States had been established.
The Civil War was the bloodiest and most costly of all American wars because Americans were killing Americans. Approximately 620,000 died on both sides, and the toll of other casualties was catastrophic, especially in the South, where entire cities like Atlanta and Richmond lay in ashes and the countryside was stripped of crops and livestock. While most northern states were spared the agonies of battles and physical destruction, the human toll was nevertheless staggering. The phenomenon of 'soldier's heart', or what today is called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was widespread. Across the nation, north and south, tens of thousands of soldiers were homeless and psychologically or physically incapacitated, reduced in many cases to begging. This was in an era when there was no Veteran's Administration to provide care or benefi ts. Some states, like Massachusetts, established homes for the stricken, but many, and especially in the devastated south, could not afford these measures. The carnage of the war was so horrifi c that it altered the American concept of death itself, as civilians at home tried to come to terms with overwhelming loss. Both sides, for different reasons, adhered to a faith that the fallen had died for transcendent and noble purposes, rather than in ignominy.

Lincoln did not issue the famous Emancipation Proclamation until 1863, two years after the war began, and to a great extent did so out of expediency. While Lincoln himself opposed slavery on moral grounds, he emphasized in his campaign speeches that he had no intention of abolishing slavery, but merely wanted to limit it to the areas where it already existed. In 1863, despite every advantage, the North was losing the war. Conscription had been implemented and it was violently opposed, leading to destructive draft riots in northern cities. One reason the Emancipation Proclamation was issued was to provide incentives to northern blacks to enlist in the Union Army. Until that moment black people saw the confl ict as a white man's war. If the goal of abolishing slavery could be added to the preservation of the Union, blacks would overwhelmingly support Lincoln. Once the proclamation was issued over 200,000 free blacks and escaped slaves did enlist and they played a major role in winning their own freedom.
The Emancipation Proclamation freed all slaves in areas not occupied by the Union Army (which meant in 1863 that it freed not a single slave! Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and Tennessee remained slave states and in the Union) but their legal status at the end of the war after the Confederacy surrendered remained unclear. So 'radicals' in Congress, all northerners or representatives of border states, fostered the addition of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in 1865, declaring all slaves henceforth free. At fi rst this was deemed adequate to ensure that freedmen were now American 'citizens'. But few whites treated them as such, and not only in the defeated South. So in 1868, and again in 1870, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were added, granting citizenship and the right to vote to all freed men. The eleven states that had seceded were not to be re-admitted to the Union, or allowed to vote in any elections, until they had ratifi ed these three amendments. They did so but only under duress and throughout the South freed blacks could exercise civil rights only where federal troops were stationed to protect them. But in the north the public tired of the seemingly endless occupation, weary of those waving the 'bloody shirt' of the rebellion and calling for further punishment of the South, and demanded that the troops be brought home once and for all.
In 1876 the former states in rebellion were fi nally allowed to vote in presidential elections. The election of that year was by far the most corrupt and contentious in American history. Lincoln was the fi rst Republican president and the Republican Party ruled in Washington. No white southerner would vote for a party so identifi ed with defeat and occupation. Although many northern whites, known as carpetbaggers, moved into the South their numbers were not enough to overcome the opposition of white southerners to Republican rule. While freed blacks certainly identifi ed with the Republicans, most were effectively disenfranchised by the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist organizations. The Klan had been founded by bitter confederate veterans at the close of the war who were committed to white supremacy despite defeat. Thus, in the key election of 1876 white terrorists prevented many blacks and northern whites from ever reaching the polls. By these corrupt measures Democrats claimed victory.
Republicans objected and the result was that in three key states (Florida was one) dangerous disputes arose over which party had actually won electoral votes. The argument grew so violent that civil war was brewing again in some areas. Northerners were in no mood to resume hostilities and so pressure mounted to resolve the issues. At fi rst it was proposed that Congress rule on the matter, but since it was dominated by Republicans that was not acceptable. Then the problem was tossed to the Supreme Court but the same dilemma obtained there. A special commission was appointed but its membership contained eight Republicans and seven Democrats. The political stalemate threatened to break out into renewed warfare in the South and so a great 'compromise' was reached behind closed doors in smoke and whisky fi lled rooms. If Democrats would give up their claims and allow Rutherford B. Hayes (known thereafter as 'his fraudulency') to assume the presidency, he would subsequently remove all federal troops from the South. The return to self-rule and white supremacy, rather than who occupied the White House, was of far greater importance to southerners and so the compromise was accepted.
Virtually on the day that Union forces left the South, the Ku Klux Klan took over and the former slaves were stripped of civil and political rights and most were reduced virtually to the same status as under slavery. Though technically 'free' they had no land and no means to self-suffi ciency and were at the mercy largely of their former masters. Most became tenant farmers or remained as domestic servants. Unable to vote and alter their circumstances the majority of blacks remained trapped in debt servitude. Tenants were bound to the land by debt incurred when tools, seeds and livestock were loaned by landowners at usurious rates. Very few were able to get out of debt and profi t to the point where they could buy land outright for themselves. When courageous freedmen and women attempted to exercise their newly promised rights they were faced with the Nazi-like evil of the Klan. One prominent politician and abolitionist, Carl Schurz, wrote to President Andrew Johnson that: Dead bodies of murdered Negroes were found on or near highways and byways. Gruesome reports came from the hospitals -reports of colored men and women whose ears had been cut off, whose skulls had been broken by blows, whose bodies had been slashed by knives or lacerated by scourges.

Meanwhile the territories ceded by Mexico and Britain in the far west would have to be settled, and this meant the conquest and displacement of yet more native tribes. The pattern of Indian removal and genocide followed the template set in the earliest years of colonization. In the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona and California, the US government and state offi cials signed formal treaties with the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Nez Perce, Apache, Comanche, Hopi, Navaho and many other tribes, granting them ownership of territories in 'perpetuity'. But whites poured into these lands in violation of the treaties and demanded that the federal government not only protect them, but enable them to settle. It was not long before offi cial American government actions effectively betrayed commitment to the treaties. As natives fought back, more and more troops were rushed into the west and the natives were gradually defeated and forced to live on reservations, usually on the worst land with fewest resources. A number of signal events occurred that were celebrated as great victories over tribes in the west but were really gruesome slaughters.
The infamous Sand Creek Massacre occurred on November 29, 1864. By a treaty of 1851 with the US government, the Cheyenne and Arapaho had been granted a vast territory encompassing parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. When gold was discovered in Colorado in 1858 whites demanded a revision of the treaty. The native chieftains knew they could not defeat the US Army so they signed an agreement accepting a reservation about onethirteenth the size of the original area. This caused many younger tribesmen who called themselves Dog Soldiers to revolt which brought renewed warfare between them and American soldiers.
Nevertheless the chiefs who had signed the acceptance attempted to keep it. They were told to camp their people numbering about 400 old men, women and children, near Fort Lyon at Sand Creek, where they would be regarded as friendly. Despite this, Colonel John Chivington of the Colorado Militia led a force of 800 drunken men to attack the camp. Even though the Cheyenne chief, Black Kettle, waved an American fl ag given him by Abraham Lincoln, a terrible massacre ensued. Small children were used as target practice. Men and women alike were scalped and their private parts cut out to be worn and later displayed as trophies in Denver. Virtually all the people in the encampment were killed. About 50 soldiers also died from their own 'friendly fi re' induced by their drunkenness.
As a direct result of this wanton slaughter the Dog Soldiers took their revenge on thousands of American civilians. A committee to investigate the massacre held an open meeting in Denver only to be greeted by a huge crowd shouting 'Exterminate them, Exterminate them all!' Many soldiers claimed the natives had fi red fi rst, though this was impossible since no native warriors had been present. One of Chivington's offi cers, Captain Silas Soule, who had refused to attack, bore witness to what had really happened. He was murdered a few weeks later.
The Cheyenne and Arapaho clan structure and way of life was effectively destroyed. Chivington was criticized by the committee but no punishment was levied. He would later justify his savage acts with the words 'Nits make lice.'

The nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. These words were written by L. Frank Baum, later to become the beloved author of The Wizard of Oz.

From 1865, at the close of the Civil War, to 1898, the United States underwent change so transformative that it emerged suddenly as a nation primed to leap upon the stage of global power to compete for empire with Europe and Japan. No comprehension of this process can be complete without understanding the enormous social and economic upheavals and dislodgments that resulted throughout this period from a renewal of the industrialization that had been on hold since the outbreak of civil war. One major result of the Union victory was the collapse of the political power of the old southern 'plantocracy' and its transfer to the industrialists and fi nanciers centered on Wall Street. Soon to be known as plutocrats this new ruling class quickly legislated more centralized banking, fostered high tariffs to ward off competition from abroad and passed the Homestead Act to rapidly populate the west and develop interior markets.
Americans settled more land after 1870 than they had in the previous 300 years.

The new system, however, brought equally massive dislocations of people. The pre-existing domestic population was not large enough to meet the increasing demand for unskilled labor in the proliferating factories. Resulting pressure by industrialists on the government forced changes to immigration laws and allowed huge numbers of foreigners to enter the country. But innovative agricultural technology rendered American farmhands obsolete and reduced their numbers, so rural dwellers were forced to move in huge numbers to urban areas for work, or to uproot to settle the far west.
Industrial capitalism produced immense profi ts but the new wealth was not shared equitably. Great fortunes were being made for a minority (though a much larger middle class also emerged) but extensive poverty was the lot of a huge part of the population. A major consequence of these many developments was the rapid change in the character of cities. As rural peoples and immigrants moved to urban centers, most cities in the north increased exponentially in size and population. Alongside the mansions of the rich, and the stalwart abodes of the new middle classes, slum dwellings multiplied overnight. Here, infrastructure such as clean running water and sanitation services were non-existent. Public privies in congested alleys were the norm. Horses still abounded and dropped their wastes in the streets, there to remain. Overcrowding and disease followed inexorably. These conditions, coupled with work days often 14 hours long, led to life expectancy being far shorter than today.
As if these multiple evils were not enough, they were exacerbated by the sheer instability of the fi nance system and the production cycle of boom and bust. There were no methods to judge the ability of this growing population to consume the vast quantities of commodities fl ooding the domestic market. As industrialization commenced the ideology of 'laissez-faire' became fashionable among those who benefi ted primarily from the new wealth and it therefore became the predominant doctrine of the master classes. This new secular religion held that the government should not interfere to regulate the marketplace lest it throw its 'natural' tendency to equilibrium out of balance. In the end, its proponents argued, the market would right itself. This completely ignored the fact for millions of people at the bottom end of the employment scale, wages were too often inadequate for necessities and the situation was far worse when unemployment rose, as it did with regularity.
People who had been independent artisans making a living under their own command, or who owned and ran small farms, now found themselves out-competed by machine-driven corporations, forced out of business and into the new class of wage-laborers, or 'wage-slaves' as they called themselves. With nothing but their labor to sell in a marketplace that was becoming the overarching regulator of social and economic life, they had no choice but to take jobs as factory workers, usually for considerably less money than they had made while their previous artisanal skills were still of use and value.
The ideology of laissez-faire also ignored the basic reason for the cycle: overproduction. In the scramble to profi t in the new economy manufacturers had to rely on 'economies of scale'. Huge factories would produce consumer goods willy-nilly, with no way of knowing the limits of the public's ability to buy and consume them. Sooner or later such anarchic production would fl ood the market with more goods than the people could consume. This, in turn, would require the shut-down of manufacturing and the subsequent lay-off of much of the work force. This then led to a drop in the ability of the unemployed to buy, leading to further damage to other sectors of the economy in a cascading ripple-effect.
Such business downturns had always characterized the American economy, but in the post-Civil War era the scope and size of the industrial economy meant greater dislocations and consequences for millions. Between 1873 and 1877, and 1893 and 1896, two catastrophic depressions occurred with dismal results for those in the bottom half of American society.
By 1886 railroad construction had virtually ended, leaving large numbers of the approximately 200,000 iron and steel workers unemployed with few other opportunities. 
6
While industrialists and fi nanciers were quick to grasp the new opportunities made available by mechanization, they were equally quick to contradict their own doctrine of laissez-faire when depression eroded profi ts. They formed political organizations, like the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Board of Trade, the American Banking Association and others, to lobby government for special favors in the form of tax breaks, land deals and legislation protecting them from foreign competition, and especially laws to limit the freedom of wage workers to unionize or strike. While claiming that the American creed gave them the right to pursue self-interest in the market, plutocrats were keen to deny similar guarantees to their work force. Thus the new working class came rapidly to the conclusion that it had to organize in the form of labor unions and new political parties in order to meet the power of the industrial and fi nancial magnates and to obtain a fair share of the profi ts their labor produced. Small farmers also formed the National Farm Alliance in an attempt to counter the railroad owners and middlemen who profi ted even as the farmers went bankrupt. As the political clout of the new plutocrats increased, the movement of those whose labor was key to the entire industrial enterprise grew in intensity.
When boom turned to bust, and life became intolerable for the poor and unemployed in both the urban slums and rural areas, the only alternative was strikes, walkouts and boycotts as victims of the downturn attempted to force those profi ting from the system to share the wealth they derived from the very labor of those they treated with contempt. Many new immigrants came from countries in Europe with traditions of socialist politics and they brought these ideas to the US where they were immediately branded 'un-American'. A great ferment of social discontent and rebellion among the native and foreign-born stirred the land. Violence rocked cities, factories and railways.
Long known as 'robber barons' the new industrialists, and the fi nanciers who were their partners, used their wealth to buy political authority, becoming effectively the powerbrokers behind the 'throne' of constitutional government. Thus they could enact legislation that outlawed strikes and mass demonstrations and could jail labor leaders. Elected offi cials would often be openly referred to as the 'senator from the Standard Oil Company' or the 'congressman from Dupont'. Even John Hay, Abraham Lincoln's former secretary and soon to be secretary of state under McKinley, deplored the situation: 'This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations. How is this?'

A Gordian knot of crisis in the late nineteenth century affl icted the nation. By all measures the depression of the 1890s created 'a greater loss and more suffering than ever before in the history of the country'. 
13
14
The profound crisis engendered by the Depression of 1893-1897 catalyzed the consensus among elites that has been the driving force of American foreign policy ever since. Driven by the universal conclusion that the limits of production and consumption in domestic markets had been reached, convinced that continental territories necessary for population expansion were also limited, historians, social theorists, naval strategists and religious fi gures developed intellectual rationales across all disciplines that ultimately met and confl ated. Deeply infl uenced by what appeared to be a consistent and coherent theoretical solution to the growing crisis, political and governmental elites embarked upon the course of expansion and empire. To foster domestic stability, provide employment, sell commodities -in essence to maintain the integrity of capitalism itself -new foreign markets would be found, or created, and they would also be defended against rivals, or from peoples who would reject American intervention in their lands.
Simultaneously, the barons understood that their foreign industrial competitors, chiefl y Britain but also the rising nations of Germany and Japan, were experiencing similar problems. Thus, the leap upon the stage of empire would also intensify existing imperial rivalry. The US had by far the greatest advantage in industrial strength; it would soon maximize that advantage by building one of the most powerful navies on earth, to project American power into the far reaches of the planet.
As early as 1853 William Seward, later Secretary of State, refl ected the unapologetic expansionist sentiment of the political classes:
Multiply your ships and send them forth to the East. The nation that draws most materials and provisions from the earth, and fabricates the most, and sells the most of productions and fabrics to foreign nations, must be, and will be, the great power of the earth.

In 1889 the Cleveland Administration convened a pan-American conference aimed at creating a permanent customs union and a tribunal to arbitrate confl ict between western hemispheric nations. Secretary of State James G. Blaine declared the conference had created a new 'Magna Carta' but the Argentine statesman Roque Saenz-Pena said that Blaine had desired 'to make of America a market, and of the sovereign states, tributaries'. The Latin American nations could not overcome their understandable distrust of the colossus to the north, given the history of American intervention in the region. They had seen nothing as yet.
Attention then turned to Hawaii where commercial growers of sugar and pineapples had long been investing in the islands, leading Secretary of State Blaine to assert in 1881 that since sugar producers in Hawaii had become utterly dependent on the US continental market, the islands had become 'part of the commercial system of the American states'. In 1888 another secretary of state, James Bayard, said the US had only 'to wait quietly and patiently and let the islands fi ll up with American planters and industries until they should be wholly identifi ed with the United States. It was simply a matter of waiting until the apple should fall.'

Lodge's challenge was quickly taken up; Hawaii was annexed in 1898. While the preponderant aim was economic, there were many among the elite who had ulterior motives. The new proponents of naval power, especially Theodore Roosevelt, had long cast covetous eyes upon one of the Pacifi c's most desirable anchorages at Pearl Harbor. Establishment of the American naval base there, followed almost simultaneously by acquisition of a similar base in the Philippines, greatly worried Japan and set the two nations on a collision course.
In 1895 a dramatic dispute between Britain and Venezuela nearly brought the US and London to the brink of war but resulted fi nally in Britain's acquiescence to the Monroe Doctrine. Venezuela had long chafed at Britain's claim that its colony of Guiana extended across the Orinoco River. When gold was discovered in the disputed region Britain threatened to send troops to enforce its claim. Britain had also recently landed forces in Nicaragua, and British investments throughout Latin America threatened American determination to solve domestic economic problems by increasing exports to the region. Thus, if this claim stood it would guarantee continued British naval power in the Caribbean and thwart American objectives. The Cleveland Administration therefore insisted that Britain submit its claim to international arbitration. US offi cials cared little about Venezuela's concerns; indeed, in the end Britain got to keep the territory. The issue boiled down to American desire to thwart British power in the Caribbean.
Arguing that the Monroe Doctrine's enforcement was 'important to our peace and safety as a nation and is essential to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government', President Cleveland stated fl atly that 'The duty of the United States is to resist by every means in its power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of governmental jurisdiction over any territory, which after investigation we have determined belongs to Venezuela.'

Today the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fi at is law upon the subjects to which it confi nes its interposition. Why? It is not because of the pure friendship or the good will felt for it…it is because, in addition to all other grounds, its infi nite resources combined with its isolated position render it master of the situation and practically invulnerable as against any and all other powers.

The dawning of this new American empire was buttressed by key intellectual rationales, the fundamental outlines of which are critically necessary to understanding the age and the events which followed.
Fredrick Jackson Turner's famous thesis on the closing of the American West, The Significance of the Frontier in American History, had enormous infl uence. Noting the deep anxieties caused among ordinary American workers and farmers, as well as elites, about depression, agrarian unrest, labor strikes and large-scale immigration, this historian argued that the previous availability of land had conferred a signifi cant measure of economic power and independence to many average Americans. But industrial expansion, railroads, electronic communications and population explosion had put an end to the traditional frontier as a 'safety valve'. The American west no longer offered escape. The drawbacks of industrial capitalism had now brought the United States to a 'watershed' moment. Either American institutions would have to be radically altered to suit a non-expanding society, or a new frontier would have to be found.
For nearly three hundred years the dominant fact of American life has been expansion. With the settlement of the Pacifi c Coast and the occupation of the free lands, this movement has come to a check. That these energies of expansion will no longer operate would be a rash prediction; and the demands for a vigorous foreign policy, for an inter-oceanic canal, for a revival of our power upon the seas, and for the extension of American infl uence to outlying islands and adjoining countries, are indications that the movement will continue.

Inevitably, as had been the case since the fi rst colonization of the Americas, religion would also become an element in the rationale for the new American empire. Ironically, religious advocates were also quick to adopt Social Darwinism to their causes. Among the most infl uential advocates of 'Anglo-Saxon Christianity' or 'Christian imperialism' was Josiah Strong. Born on the frontier, he became secretary of the Home Missionary Society, and was among two or three of the most infl uential religious fi gures of the late nineteenth century. His book, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis, sold over 175,000 copies, an enormous fi gure for that time. Though he decried the ills of industrial capitalism and the 'idolatry' of money and capital, he also claimed that 'The world is to be Christianized and civilized…commerce follows the missionary…A Christian civilization performs the miracle of the loaves and fi shes and feeds its thousands in a desert.' For Strong the salvation of America lay in the fulfi llment of the Anglo-Saxon mission to reshape the world. Hearkening all the way back to the Puritans he claimed that 'we are the chosen people' who nevertheless could not remain imprisoned on the North American continent:
The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken. The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history -the fi nal competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled…Then this race of unequaled energy, with all the majesty of numbers and the might of wealth behind it -the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the highest civilization -having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth. If I read not amiss, this powerful race will move down upon Mexico, down upon Central and South America, out upon the islands of the sea, over upon Africa and beyond. And can any one doubt that the results of this competition of races will be the 'survival of the fi ttest'? 
34
Of all the European powers that the US had wished expelled from the western hemisphere, Spain with its continued control of Cuba and Puerto Rico rankled most. A great measure of prejudice derived from Spain's Catholicism which fed longstanding attitudes about that nation's 'backwardness'. Spanish rule in Cuba was especially cruel because of constant uprisings by Cuban independentistas, and the misery of the Cuban population was a constant theme in the American press. But these issues were useful camoufl age and propaganda for the deeper desire on the part of elites to seize the islands, establish control over their economies, build naval installations and consolidate control of the Caribbean; thence to take up the issue of a canal through the isthmus of Central America.
President McKinley was very much an economic nationalist. As he put it himself his 'greatest ambition was to round out his career by gaining American superiority in world markets'.

We can and will take a large slice of the commerce of Asia. That is what we want. We are bound to share in the commerce of the Far East, and it is better to strike for it while the iron is hot.

It is often forgotten that Roosevelt was a Harvard-trained historian whose written works were fundamentalist panegyrics to American supremacy and expansionism. Thus he was central to that growing coterie of intellectuals within the circles of power who saw him as their 'man brimming with martial spirit'.

The year 1898 would become one of the most momentous in US history. That year the US would actively seek war with Spain, claiming offi cially that the goals were to banish the corrupt and brutal Spanish fi nally from the western hemisphere, put an end to the constant violence that threatened American investments in tobacco and sugar and promote freedom for the colonized peoples in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. That year the United States would also issue the fi rst of its Open Door Notes, articulating the policy that remains the bedrock of American relations with the rest of humanity. War with Spain, then Another and Another
The power that rules the Pacifi c…rules the world. Reading the lengthy inscription on the monument a tourist could easily believe that the courage, daring and valiant sacrifi ce of American forces had saved the republic from imminent invasion. In fact, it was one of the most one-sided 'victories' in the annals of American warfare, a classic case of the elephant versus the ant. The Spanish fl eet was destroyed in a matter of hours and no American died from Spanish gunfi re. The remainder of the war was only somewhat more consequential in terms of casualties. Indeed, more Americans died from illness, due primarily to poisoned foodstuffs provided by corrupt suppliers, than from the effects of battle. More Americans would die later, in the subsequent war waged against Filipino insurgents attempting to win the independence that had been promised them by President William McKinley, an assurance that was betrayed. The focus of American hostility towards Spain was its presence in Cuba. The Spanish fl eet in the Philippines posed no conceivable threat to American security, yet the naval squadron commanded by Dewey had been secretly ordered by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt to position itself to attack at Manila the moment that the war he machinated to bring about began. As a major proponent of Mahan's navalism, Roosevelt believed that acquisition of the Philippines was necessary for further American expansion and power as he exclaimed on so many occasions well before war actually broke out. 
1
Though it is often claimed that President William McKinley opposed war, and was ultimately overcome by political opposition, it was McKinley who approved Roosevelt as assistant secretary (though he was a well-known jingo and expansionist), who approved Roosevelt's secret order to Dewey and who ordered the battleship Maine to Havana. The president was merely rhetorically for peace, while his policies carried the nation inexorably toward war. Though he declared in his inaugural address that 'we want no wars of conquest, we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression', his inaugural parade involved crack troops and cavalry marching with precision in a display of martial discipline not seen in the capital since the Civil War. 
2
As in many other cases of American confl icts the Spanish-American War was fomented on outright lies and trumped up accusations against the intended enemy, and was foisted by politicians, press and pulpit on a public reeling from the grim consequences of a lengthy depression.
There had always been a bloc in Congress lobbying for annexation of Cuba, Santo Domingo and Puerto Rico. The slavocracy had desired the islands in order to expand slave production in sugar, tobacco and cotton. Later, in the early years after the Civil War when the issue of equal rights for black Americans grew ever more contentious, opponents of outright seizure objected on the basis that incorporating more blacks into the union would only worsen an already undesirable problem. By the late nineteenth century, however, as the multifaceted crisis of overproduction, depression and unemployment deepened, political and economic elites committed American policies to expansion. Thus their spokesmen began to look upon Spain's possessions as vital requirements to the new American empire. Senator Lodge declared: …We should build the Nicaragua canal…and when the Nicaraguan canal is built the island of Cuba… will become a necessity…the great nations are rapidly absorbing for their future expansion and their present defense all the waste places of the earth…as one of the great nations of the world the United States must not fall out of the line of march.
While such men employed the language of armed might with frankness and candor to each other, they understood that war with Spain could only be sold to a public as all American wars are packaged. They claimed that 'security' of the hemisphere was endangered by the brutal Spanish requiring an unpleasant but necessary mission to liberate oppressed Cubans and provide them the gift of democracy. The political elites pitched arguments, duly carried in the press and clearly intended to overcome profound anxieties caused by the depression, that the expulsion of the Spanish from the islands would open them up to American economic development and the construction of the new navy would thus benefi t the US economy as a whole. Despite these rationales war fever in the general population never reached a critical temperature until the accidental sinking of the USS Maine was deliberately, and falsely, attributed to Spanish villainy.
Cuban exiles living in New York constantly agitated in the press for American intervention to save the populace from the cruelties practiced by the Spanish army. Cuban rebels on the island operated then, as all guerrillas do, against armies of overwhelming superiority, and as American Minutemen (a volunteer militia said to be ready in a minute's notice) did against the British in 1775. They conducted hit and run tactics and then vanished into the vast sea of the population. The Spanish responded, again as all imperial powers do, by attempting to dry up the sea. They drove masses of people off their land and into what amounted to concentration camps. They also practiced summary execution of rebels, and purely innocent civilians alike. These reconcentrados quickly became breeding grounds for disease and starvation, so huge numbers died. This situation was appalling enough but the so-called 'yellow journals', newspapers that traded in sensationalism, embellished, exaggerated and invented ever more lurid and graphic accounts of Spanish atrocities as they sought to infl ame public opinion on the side of intervention. In an example intended deliberately to whet the prurience of a Victorian-era public, the Spanish were accused of strip-searching a Cuban woman aboard an American vessel. The reality was that the woman was searched by other women, and not stripped. The vessel had been boarded by Spanish forces because it was secretly smuggling arms to Cuban rebels and the woman was carrying documents involving her in the Cuban struggle. Another prevarication issued from Congress, when Senator John Morgan claimed that American citizens in Cuba were 'now literally starving to death for want of provisions and supplies'. 
3
Then, as now, with rare exceptions, the press largely sided with the opinions and goals of the corporate and political elites determined to fi nd some pretence for war with Spain. Usually the issue was framed in terms of humanitarianism and the idea that Cubans were engaged in a struggle all but identical with that which the Americans had waged against Britain in 1776. Yet, the Washington Post put matters in the rawest and most primitive terms: 'We are face to face with a strange destiny,' the paper editorialized. 'The taste of empire is in the mouth of the people even as the taste of blood.'

A grave danger represents itself. Two-fi fths of the insurgents in the fi eld are negroes. These men would…in the event of success, demand a predominant share in the government of the country… the result being, after years of fi ghting, another black republic.
The Spanish themselves, in an effort to ward off American intervention appealed to traditional European racism saying that 'In this revolution, the negro element has the most important part…and the result of the war, if the Island can be declared independent, will be a secession of the black element and a black republic.'

In their efforts to banish Spain from the hemisphere US policymakers faced a glaring problem. The Cuban liberation movement was winning and it seemed quite likely that Spain would grant independence to the Cubans. Since the real goal of US policy was to take over from the Spanish and then label American rule a victory for 'democracy', this turn of events simply would not do. American war hawks now moved with alacrity.
In January 1898 McKinley warned Spain against outbursts of anti-Americanism and ordered the USS Maine to Havana harbor, ostensibly to protect American citizens. In a cryptic message to a diplomat Senator Lodge wrote that 'There may be an explosion any day in Cuba which would settle a great many things. We have got a battleship in the harbor of Havana, and our fl eet, which overmatches anything the Spanish have, is masked at the Dry Tortugas.' Then on February 15 the prescribed explosion occurred, killing over 250 sailors and marines, resulting in the worst (at the time) naval disaster in US history. While it is generally agreed today that the USS Maine was sunk by the internal buildup of coal dust, war hawks at the time rapidly blamed the sinking on Spanish treachery. Though McKinley appointed a naval board of inquiry few believed it would be impartial, much less blame the navy for the catastrophe no matter where the evidence lay. Indeed, the board ultimately ruled that a 'submarine mine' of unknown provenance had destroyed the Maine, implying that the Spanish had some covert role. McKinley immediately demanded that Spain lay down its arms, allow the US to mediate between the Spanish government and rebels and revoke the re-concentration measures. Secretly, however, he ordered the US ambassador to inform the Spanish government that the US would devote its 'friendly offi ces' to Cuban independence. This was the one stipulation, McKinley knew well, that the Spanish must reject, though Spain met his fi rst demands. Ignoring these concessions McKinley ordered Dewey to commence battle even before he addressed Congress to demand 'the forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war, according to the large dictates of humanity…'

In short order, with a crushing victory over Spain, the Caribbean Sea became, as the Romans used to say, mare nostrum, 'our sea'. All four island-nations became de facto American colonies, exploited as bases for the American navy and for their resources, their people now serving American masters. Cuba's constitution was written in Washington and came with the proviso known as the Platt Amendment that the US could intervene militarily on the island any time American interests were said to be at risk. The Philippines had been promised outright independence but Manila Bay put the US at 'the doorstep to Asia' and no imperial advantage such as this could be surrendered no matter what had been guaranteed. When Filipinos rose in rebellion against the army that had claimed to free them, the US had its fi rst counter-insurgency jungle war which it waged with utmost brutality, killing upwards of 200,000 civilians, the greatest number of civilian deaths up to that time.
With the riches of Asia looming, which of the new empires would dominate?
At this critical stage the US enunciated its plans for the future and on fi rst sight these seemed benign, and equitable as well. The Open Door policy asserted the right of all nations to access the wealth of China on equal terms. But since the US economy could already out-compete its capitalist rivals, and would begin with a clear-cut advantage, American rivals understood that the US could potentially close the doors to them. Japan especially took notice. Washington was asserting the fundamental rules of a new game, applicable to the entire world, even if the US was not yet powerful enough to enforce them. But the message was clear. Henceforth, the markets and resources of the world would remain open to American penetration. From that moment on the US would rely increasingly on its arms to enforce what would come to be its overarching policy.
Meanwhile, the shores of the new American lake had to be pacifi ed. American marines were landed in Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and those nations brought to heel. Colombia was refusing to allow a new inter-oceanic canal through its province of Panama to enable the American navy and merchant fl eet to pass easily between the Atlantic and Pacifi c. Roosevelt's solution was simple. He told Washington's handpicked Panamanian rebels to declare independence and then dispatched the navy and marines to prevent Colombia from doing anything about it. Some in Congress objected to this naked land grab but, said Teddy, 'I took the Panama Canal, let Congress debate!' Only a few years later Woodrow Wilson would justify the new war against Mexico with the words 'I will teach them to elect good men.'
The United States had joined the club of empire. World War I: Making the World Safe for American Capital Investment
In American national mythology World War I is represented, in the words of President Woodrow Wilson, as the war waged 'to make the world safe for democracy'. It was also claimed to be the 'war to end all wars'. In the standard version of American entry into World War I Wilson strove heroically to keep the US neutral and out of the war but German violations of American neutrality and international law had shattered the global system. Thus, he claimed, events out of his control fi nally forced him to intervene because only American power and righteousness could restore international order. The reality was that Britain was the fi rst to breach maritime law. Wilson merely pretended neutrality while his policies were carrying the country inexorably into the war.
American public opinion was overwhelmingly opposed to intervention of any kind, so war hawks in both parties, and especially Wilson, had to walk a political tightrope to avoid endangering their real agenda and careers. The Republican opposition, which had launched the nation on to the stage of global competition and aggression only a generation previously, and was still anxious to extend American power, cast Wilson as weak and unable to promote American 'preparedness' and national security in the face of Germany's alleged threat to the Americas. Yet Wilson was serving their ends, if not as expeditiously as they wished. Meanwhile, Democratic Party bosses anguished at the ferment of real democracy represented by the demands of progressive reformers and used the war to call their 'patriotism' into question. The country's major fi nanciers and industrialists grew fearful that defeat for Britain and France would bankrupt both nations, cause profi ts to plummet and wreck the corporate economy already in depression. For Wilson the war presented the precious opportunity to advance himself as the savior of international order, and at the same time to hasten the ascendancy of the United States to global preeminence. But to realize his grandiose vision Wilson needed to ensure that he would have to enter the war and he required a place at the table when the peace was crafted.

While the United States would be catapulted nearly to the pinnacle of global power, the war solved little between its European rivals. The so-called 'peace' that followed the war was merely a temporary truce. The world was made safe for more war. Round Two would ensue soon enough. The failure of the peace after World War I would intensify totalitarianism in the shape of Nazism, Stalinism and Japanese militarism, as the traditional and victorious European powers maneuvered desperately to maintain the illusion of their own sovereignty and cling to their empires. Subsequently, as renewed crises unfolded in the 1930s, and as more sophisticated internationalists ascended to power under President Franklin Roosevelt, the moment approached when the US could achieve global dominance and restructure the global system to serve American ends, or lose that opportunity and watch as the planet divided into autonomous and mutually exclusive blocs.
The war erupted in 1914 but its real origins lay deeply buried in Europe's history, as a result of alliances and secret deals between the European powers, each seeking its own advantage and aggrandizement. Britain, France and Russia had entered into an alliance known as the Triple Entente, while Germany, Austria and Turkey had fostered the Triple Alliance, promoting a dangerous arms race that promoted paranoia and mistrust all around. In both cases secret agreements were made such that, in the case of war, territories, resources and markets under the control of the enemy would pass to the opposite side. When immense reserves of oil in Persia (present day Iran) were discovered, with similar fi elds certain in Mesopotamia (Iraq and Kuwait), where Britain, France, and Germany vied for infl uence, the great prize of the Middle East was also at stake. All that was needed in such tinder was a mere spark. That fl ashpoint arrived with the assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne in the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia by a Serbian. When Austria declared war on Serbia, Russia then came to the aid of its Slavic cousin. This set in motion Germany's treaty obligation to Austria, then Britain and France entered as allies of Russia. While Germany is usually blamed for the war by its enemies, culpability lay with all of the competing European powers. Their self-aggrandizing, imperial antagonisms all but ensured war.
While German submarine warfare against American shipping in the Atlantic was the stated cause for American entry into the war, the most important issue for American elites was the growing preeminence of Germany in the European heartland, its challenge to the stability of the global system as it then existed and to their hope to take charge and rationalize that system themselves. Germany and the United States (and Japan) had arrived upon the stage of great power simultaneously in the late nineteenth century, each in their own way testing the strength of the empires already established. German military men, economists and politicians spoke openly of Germany's right to a 'place in the sun' and for a self-contained central European empire that they termed 'Mitteleuropa'.

This brought the issue of the Open Door in Europe into question for the US. The European core was the largest consumer of American industrial and agricultural commodities. American banks drew great profi ts from fi nancing this trade, while the US government allowed corporate giants to fl out the new anti-trust laws in their overseas operations. 
3
At the war's outset President Wilson issued an executive decree calling for American neutrality, but this did not have the power of law and could not be enforced. Nor was it intended to be. In truth, neither Wilson nor any of his major advisers (with the exception of William Jennings Bryan, who would soon resign) were remotely neutral. Some members of Congress earnestly wished to avoid American entanglement and passed laws that certain commodities were contraband, like weapons and ammunition, and could not be sold to either warring side. American bankers and industrialists preferred to deal with both sides, wherever there were profi ts to be made, and traded contraband items surreptitiously.
The standard interpretation of America's entry into the war focuses on two precipitating events: the decision by Germany in early 1917 to resume attacking merchant vessels, including the 'neutral' vessels of the US, with the new sea weapon the submarine, and the widespread anger toward Germany when the Zimmerman Note was revealed, a so-called plan to reward Mexico with territories lost in 1848 in exchange for declaring war on the US. The reality lay behind-the-scenes.
Wilson believed that the US had arrived at a moment ripe for the US to assume international supremacy and for him to promote himself as rescuer of global order. Unlike his predecessor Theodore Roosevelt, who openly demanded war with Germany, Wilson proclaimed his desire to keep the US neutral, while actually seeking a way to enter the war under conditions that would enable the US to broker the fi nal outcome. This meant a careful, calculated approach to intervention, and dishonesty with the American electorate.
The age of corporate domination of the American economy had begun in the previous century but the reform movements of Populism and Progressivism had placed unwelcome obstacles before the new oligarchy. Even Republicans like Theodore Roosevelt had to pay lip service to surging anti-monopoly opinion, though the famous Sherman Anti-Trust law ultimately proved all but impotent. While Wilson had won the presidency in 1912 as a self-proclaimed champion of the progressives, his real fi scal and economic policies had benefi ted corporate oligarchs, though not to the satisfaction of most Republicans or Wall Street. The movement of farmers, labor and small businessmen had pushed the Democratic Party to profess many of their goals and created the illusion that a political realignment had occurred. But bosses in both parties feared this outbreak of popular democracy and the real threat that it could lead to popular sovereignty. The outbreak of war in Europe signaled the prospect of stopping these movements dead in the political waters.
'Free Trade' was the watchword of the British in their heyday of supremacy in the nineteenth century. It had the ring of magnanimity and egalitarianism but the British showed fl agrant hypocrisy as their warships and armies battered down all resistance to their imperial scheme throughout Africa and Asia, and their tariff barriers ensured that preference in trade would only apply within the British dominions. In other words free trade meant freedom primarily for Britons, based upon British power.
The Open Door policy was America's answer to British free trade. Liberal internationalism, as Wilsonian policies have been termed,

This was precisely why Germany had taken an aggressive stance in international relations. By the time many German-speaking states had unifi ed as the nation of Germany in 1871, many of the fruits of the world had been taken and locked up by the other powers.
Wilson himself said that it was a matter of 'England's having the earth and Germany's wanting it'.

Wilson's faith emphasized the moral superiority of capitalism, especially the emerging American corporate variety, and what he claimed was its potential to order the world in a peaceful, cooperative and just manner. He was utterly indifferent to the stark realities that economic competition, the no-holds-barred contest to acquire control over access to vital resources, markets and the key factor of labor (all of which constituted the very essence of capitalism), had led and would inevitably lead to other forms of international strife, especially war. The evidence was right there before him when the European war broke out, but Wilson claimed that European nations, especially Germany, were still practicing 'atavistic and irrational' patterns of behavior. All that was necessary, he asserted, was that Europeans accept American leadership of a global condominium of the industrialized nations. In this way the system that had previously been led by Britain, but which had gone astray as a result of outmoded imperial practices, could be set aright on a rational and orderly basis.
Wilson was also a religious idealist, a 'Christian Capitalist',

Throughout the fi rst two years of war the Wilson Administration assured the public that the US had no reason to enter the war. Indeed, Wilson's campaign slogan for the election of 1916 was 'He Kept Us Out of War'. Yet, within months of his re-election the president stood before Congress to ask for just such a declaration.
While Britain was certainly aware of its increasing dependence on American fi nance, London had hardly reached the point where it was ready to accept its loss of leadership, much less to surrender it to the upstart former colony. Yet such a sea change was well under way, brought about in part because of Britain's own imperial overstretch, and what was proving to be the unparalleled disaster of the war.
The Royal Navy still dominated the seas. The British government had won international acceptance of the Declaration of London in 1909, a codifi cation of the rules of sea warfare asserting legal rights for neutral nations in time of war. Americans were entitled under this international agreement to deliver exports to nations at war and to other neutrals equally without interference from belligerents.

With German markets all but vanished those at the commanding heights of the American economy saw that they were building up a vested interest in the outcome of the war. The British blockade had diverted American export trade to Britain and France thereby making general American prosperity, and corporate profi ts, dependent on transactions with the Allies alone.
The United States' economy had been in deep recession just prior to the outbreak of war. The New York Stock Exchange had even shut down for a time. Before the war, steel production fell to 50 per cent of capacity and cotton, chemicals, copper and agriculture suffered similarly. As the New York Financial Chronicle put matters, 'deadening paralysis has settled over the country's industries'. 
14
The investment banking fi rm of J.P. Morgan had become the offi cial agent for Britain and France in American capital markets, loaning both governments over $2.3 billion itself and arranging for $3 billion in contracts with American exporters. Most of the most powerful political fi gures in both parties were also dependent on Morgan money, so Morgan interests were thus a pivotal force behind the scenes pushing the American government towards war. Some of the greatest industrial giants, US Steel, Bethlehem Steel and Du Pont were de facto satellites of Morgan. Should Britain and France lose, the peace terms imposed on them by Germany would undoubtedly render them unable to repay loans and credits, and German victory might mean the closure of many European markets too, or at least restrict them on German terms at odds with the Open Door policy.

Republican Party bosses were worried because they were taken in by Wilson's pose of neutrality. Republicans were agreed on the necessity of American intervention and the overriding motive of enhancing American power on the international stage, although, like Wilson, they could not be open about this, owing to widespread popular opposition to US entry into the war. While many Republican oligarchs had invested heavily in Allied securities and certainly desired a guarantee of these investments, they also saw war as the necessary device to thwart the 'muckrakers' who had been constantly exposing their corruption and limiting the partnership between industry, fi nance and politics. War would of necessity marry corporate America to government and result in an immensely profi table alliance that would also silence the restive attempt by progressives to resuscitate popular democracy.

In 1915 the Germans learned that the British passenger liner, the Lusitania, was covertly loading banned ammunition and rifl es in its hold. The German government informed Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and also took out large advertisements in New York daily newspapers, warning the passengers that the presence of weapons aboard the ship made it a legitimate enemy target. The Germans made their intention to sink the ship very clear, warning passengers not to embark. Bryan attempted to intervene but was rebuked. He had his fi nger on the source of the problem. 'Money is the worst of all contraband,' he said, 'because it commands everything else.' 
18

Many congressional leaders declared that Americans should not board British ships at all, but Wilson did not support such calls. Despite the ominous and very public warnings from Germany, passengers were told by the shipping line that the Germans would never dare to sink the ship. The Lusitania was sunk with the loss of 124 American lives and 1,070 British passengers. Wilson could have intervened against the departure of the Lusitania, after all, given well-publicized German warnings, he knew of the ongoing and extensive trade in contraband. Despite his proclaimed neutrality Wilson did nothing to stop this traffi c, which intensifi ed the drift toward war increasingly demanded by those sectors of the business classes who had suffered losses as a result of the closure of German trade, and were now also losing money to the submarines.
Wall Street and much of the press immediately raised the slogan 'freedom of the seas', while hawks in Congress stoked the furnace for war. But the American people overwhelmingly voiced the opinion that American citizens should not embark upon belligerent vessels. Germany backed off and promised to cease attacks on merchant vessels leaving the US. The drumbeat for war nevertheless intensifi ed from many quarters. The American ambassador to Britain, Walter Page, declared that if the British navy should be defeated and the Reich gain dominance over the European continent, then Germany's increased power and infl uence throughout the world would force the US 'out of the sun'. Wilson's closest confi dant, Colonel Edward House, claimed that if Germany were to win 'our turn would come next'. Under Roosevelt the US had begun to build the world's strongest navy and this effort continued intensely under Wilson. Though the general in charge of coastal defense stated publicly that the shoreline could easily be made impregnable, the panicmongering continued.

In 1916 Wilson sent a secret note, known as the House-Grey Memorandum, to London saying that he would propose a conference led by himself to end the war. Should Germany refuse to attend, or to accept American proposals, the US would then enter the war to 'defeat militarism' once and for all. Germany was well aware that American neutrality was a sham. Later, when the conference was actually announced, one of the public proposals endorsed returning the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to France, having been taken previously by Germany in 1870. This was a proposition that new Secretary of State Robert Lansing knew Germany must reject. Therefore, Wilson would have his pretext to enter the war. In desperate straits domestically because of the blockade and fearing American entry, Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare against any and all vessels attempting to dock in England and almost immediately sank two American ships. Wilson called for Congress to allow 'armed neutrality' by providing guns for every merchant ship. Congressional opponents argued that if the US could accept Britain's nullifi cation of American shipping then it could suffer Germany's too. But, of course, that would have plummeted the American economy into instant depression. The one-sidedness of American 'neutrality' had made entry on that side inevitable.
The infamous Zimmerman Note was revealed in a manner timed to infl ame public opinion. British espionage had intercepted a telegram from Germany's foreign minister to his ambassador in Mexico informing him to endeavor to persuade Mexico to ally with Germany should Germany's efforts to keep the US neutral fail. In exchange for a declaration of war, Germany would aid Mexico to regain the American south-west, lost almost 70 years earlier in the Mexican War. The proposition was never actually delivered to Mexico. Wilson could have dismissed the Zimmerman Note as the desperate nonsense it was; Germany was in no position to give military aid to Mexico in North America. But Wilson was now leading those forces most concerned about the unfavorable long term effects on the American corporate economy and on their control of domestic politics. Hence, 'Teutonic treachery' suddenly became the watchword of the day.
The threat to shipping would undoubtedly diminish the overall value of trans-Atlantic trade, but of equal importance was the growing indebtedness of the Allies which had reached $2.3 billion, an enormous sum in 1917. From his post in London, US Ambassador Page wired the State Department to alert them to the 'international situation which is most alarming to the fi nancial and industrial outlook of the United States'. He continued:
The inevitable consequence will be that orders by all Allied governments will be reduced to the lowest possible amount and that trans-Atlantic trade will practically come to an end. The result of such a stoppage will be panic in the United States... it is not improbable that the only way of maintaining our preeminent trade position and averting war is by declaring war on Germany.

A factor equal in importance to the challenge posed by Germany to the continued evolution of a liberal capitalist world system was the Bolshevik Revolution. Germany was also at war with Tsarist Russia, a corrupt, tottering regime whose prosecution of the war ruined the peasant agricultural economy, viciously exploited the industrial working classes and sacrifi ced the lives and limbs of millions of soldiers. The result was two distinct revolutions. The fi rst was welcomed by the Wilson Administration as a step for Russia away from feudal autocracy and towards what it claimed would become liberal democratic capitalism. Most importantly, the new Russian government under Alexander Kerensky, continued to wage war on the eastern front against Germany. When this liberal revolution took power Wilson was able to claim that the war had been redefi ned as one between democracy and autocracy, hence his declaration to Congress that 'the world must be made safe for democracy', re-emphasizing his hopes that the liberal democracies of Britain and France, and now Russia, would prevail and usher in a new age. Since they would be heavily indebted to the US they would have little choice but to accept American leadership.
Yet the ravages of war for Russia cut too deep. Popular discontent and agitation against the war raged, enabling the small but highly organized Bolshevik Party to seize power and to win enough public support to govern, at least in the larger cities and nearby regions. The leaders of the Bolsheviks, especially Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, thundered against the capitalist nations and blamed the war on imperialist competition, which they said was the inevitable outcome of capitalism. They vowed that their revolution would overturn capitalism throughout the west and replace it with a more humane and just system run by and for ordinary workers and peasants. When the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace treaty with Germany that took Russia out of the war, enabling millions of German troops to be transferred to the western front, thereby jeopardizing the entire Allied position, Wilson's hope for a speedy end to the war and a new global order was profoundly endangered. The US, Allies (and Japanese) were so frightened by the communist revolution that they even redeployed troops into Russia itself in an effort to strangle the Bolshevik hold immediately. This effort failed, but undoubtedly constituted the fi rst blow in what would eventually become the Cold War.
So there was the twin specter of German submarine warfare against American shipping, and the prospects of communist revolution in Europe, both of which constituted profound threats, not only to Wilson's idealistic desires, but to what was coming to be a consensus in the ruling circles of the US for a more rationalized world system open to American economic penetration. American entry to the war would be sold as making the world 'safe for democracy'.
The American public's opposition to the war was overcome by the German attacks and the Zimmerman Note, and an intense propaganda campaign was initiated to frighten the population into believing that a new domestic menace, 'the Reds', now endangered democracy at home, though the American Justice Department had already whittled away at what remained of that. Pumped-up jingoism became the norm and all opponents of entry into the war were accused of disloyalty, cowardice and even treason. Roosevelt derided antiwar activists as 'mollycoddles' and 'weaklings'. Nativism was made to raise its bigoted head yet again. German and Irish immigrants were condemned for their 'anti-Americanism'. 'Hyphenated-Americans', said Roosevelt, could not be trusted. True, 'red-blooded' Americans would not hesitate to rise to their country's defense.
American entry, coupled with Germany's increasing inability to equip troops and feed its domestic population as a result of the British blockade, tipped the balance of the war. Facing eventual military defeat, Germany was forced to ask for an armistice. It is vitally important to understand that this was not a surrender but a cease-fi re in which Germany hoped at least to gain some of its war aims. What happened subsequently would have profound consequences for the future. The terms of the Peace Treaty of Versailles were draconian for Germany. Despite Wilson's attempt to achieve 'peace without victory', the British and French took advantage of the collapse of the German economy, and the simultaneous outbreak of what amounted to civil war within Germany, to impose a crushing burden.
Germany had not been defeated but neither had it won. Many Germans hoped that in the peace negotiations that would follow the armistice they would achieve at least some of their war aims. What actually followed is critically important in understanding why the Nazis would be so successful in the early 1930s. Though at the time of the armistice German troops had been beaten back, they had not technically surrendered and they still occupied French soil. Thus German leaders, soldiers and its people believed that 'honor' could still be salvaged. Yet despite the armistice Britain continued its blockade, thus intensifying Germany's economic collapse, with grievous conditions for civilians. Simultaneously, the success of the Bolsheviks in Russia emboldened German socialists and communists and a civil war broke out between them and rightists who claimed that Germany had been 'stabbed in the back' by traitors like the leftists and Jews. In the Peace Treaty of Versailles Germany was obliged by its weakness to accept humiliating terms. It had to take full culpability for initiating the war, though there was blame aplenty to go around among all the belligerents, and to pay enormous reparations for the costs of the war to Britain and France, thereby leaving Germany unable to care even for its millions of maimed and wounded. It also had to accept the profound humiliation of French troops occupying German soil, especially mortifying because Germany had stopped fi ghting while it still occupied French territory.
Wilson proposed sweeping peace terms known as the Fourteen Points calling for an end to secret diplomacy, arms reductions, self-determination for ethnic minorities in the fallen empires, trade barriers and trade equality among all nations and the establishment of a League of Nations committed to preventing another general war. Germany looked favorably upon these proposals because they promised the most lenient peace terms. But Wilson failed to prevent the vengeance Britain and France wreaked upon Germany, thus also precluding the reconstruction of Germany along the lines that would have re-integrated it into that concert of western industrial nations he believed was the only hope for future stability. The seeds of the next round of war were being deeply planted. The US Senate would not be a party to the Versailles Treaty, nor would it enter the League of Nations that Wilson himself had proposed as a guarantee to prevent future wars between the industrialized nations. France and Britain insisted on the most punitive sanctions, while Wilson's opponents at home like Roosevelt and Lodge assailed his calls for internationalism as detrimental to American national security. Both ridiculed Wilson's concept of the league as effectively subordinating American national sovereignty to a foreign power. Wilson was a dreamer, they exclaimed, if he thought that the US could lead the world by moral suasion. Roosevelt and Lodge and their allies wanted the United States to lead the world but to do so from a position of strength. Roosevelt even called for continued military conscription though a draft was loathed by the population at large.
Despite setbacks the US was catapulted by the war to the very forefront of international power. Its economy had grown exponentially as a result of war production and New York had effectively replaced London as the fi nance capital of the world. The US stood as virtually the only creditor nation. From 1914 to 1918 'a massive international transfer of wealth from the eastern to the western shore of the Atlantic' occurred. 
27
Yet having waged a war to make the world safe for democracy, Americans quickly saw that very little in the way of such democracy had developed overseas and this would foster within a generation the preconditions for round two of the war. Moreover, democracy was mortally wounded at home. The era of popular democracy, progressivism and reform was at an end. War production had made giants of many of the corporations that still dominate the American economy.
Many groups had been outraged over Wilson's betrayal of neutrality. His government's response was to enact legislation designed to silence the opposition, going so far as to jail many of those who took the First Amendment at face value. A highly unpopular draft law was enacted, only the second in American history. The Espionage Act of 1917 outlawed speech against the war as interference with military recruitment and carried 20-year jail sentences for those convicted. Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party and one of the most prominent dissident politicians in the nation who had been one of Wilson's opponents in the election of 1912, was sentenced to ten years in prison for a compelling speech he made against the war. His judge claimed that because there were draft-age youths in his audience his words 'would obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service'. 
28
Wilson created what amounted to the nation's fi rst ministry of propaganda in the shape of the Committee on Public Information. One of its newspaper advertisements encouraged citizens 'to report the man who spreads pessimistic stories. Report him to the Department of Justice.' One socialist, Kate Richards O'Hare, had the courage to say in a speech that 'women in the United States were no more than brood sows to raise children to get into the army and be made into fertilizer'. 
29
Even after the war Wilson's Department of Justice continued its war against pacifi sts, socialists and trade unionists during the infamous 'Red Scare', which led to the creation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After a series of bombings, including the home of the Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, by a fringe anarchist group, a new wave of xenophobia was directed against immigrants. Thousands of immigrants who held unacceptable political views were deported. Numerous American citizens were jailed for belonging to the International Workers of the World (IWW, or wobblies as they were called because they said they would start the globe shaking on its axis). The American Legion, the nation's largest veterans' organization, was established mainly to go on the offensive against 'anti-Americanism'. Though most Americans have been conditioned recently to perceive the FBI as a primary force in the 'war on terror', its initial mandate was to intimidate political opposition to the dominant parties. It was also during this time that the Ku Klux Klan expanded its numbers exponentially, especially in the northern mid-west, virtually without opposition from law enforcement, thereby enabling this terrorist organization to increase its racist attacks upon black Americans whose contributions during the war had raised their demands to achieve the constitutional guarantees denied them since the end of the Civil War.
Russia, formerly an ally of Britain and France, had withdrawn from the war in a state of collapse, then to succumb to the Bolshevik Revolution. In response Washington sent troops, with others, to intervene in an ongoing civil war on the side of forces loyal to the discredited monarchy, with hopes of strangling the communist baby in its cradle. This armed intervention in Russia is all but forgotten in the United States, but what would American history books say had Russian troops ever intervened in America's own past? Many historians date the actual onset of the Cold War to this armed incursion into Russia. One thing is certain: the extremely hostile response of the western capitalist nations to the Russian revolution had the effect of tightening the grip of totalitarianism in that country.
Faced with constant aggression from outsiders, the Soviet state quickly descended into a brutal struggle for power internally, a clash won by the most ruthless of the Bolsheviks, Stalin.
The victory of communism in the Soviet Union stimulated communists in Germany to attempt a similar revolution there. Communism, as a modern political force, had originated in Germany in the mid-nineteenth century and German communists had opposed the war. As Germany's economy collapsed after the war, civil war broke out between communists, socialists, and right-wing veterans of the war. Though the leftists were routed, and many murdered, Germany's resulting weakness ensured that it would have to accept the humiliating diktat of the Versailles Peace Treaty. It is diffi cult to convey to readers today the enormity of Germany's collapse at this point. Despite the armistice, Britain maintained the blockade of Germany's ports. In some areas of Germany starvation approached. Unemployment and infl ation reached epidemic proportions. War orphans dependent on a bankrupt state existed at subsistence levels. Amputee veterans begged in the streets. As the 1920s progressed vengeful war veterans and disaffected youth would form the nucleus of the Nazi Party and they would seek a terrible retribution from those they blamed for defeat -the 'disloyal' communists, the Jews and the victorious British and French. The seeds of World War II and the Holocaust were sown in the so-called 'peace' after World War I.
Though most of the carnage of World War I had devastated Europe, the war also penetrated the far side of the globe. Japan, newly emerged as a great power after its crushing defeat of Russia in 1904, had allied with Britain and as a result had occupied Germany's possessions in the Far East. Having penetrated northern China, annexed Korea and taken areas of Siberia from Russia, Japan now expanded economically in regions previously dominated by Europeans. But Japan also rankled at the treatment it received as an ally of Britain against Germany. Japan was not allowed to keep possession of some of Germany's Pacifi c colonies, while Britain and the US attempted to impose second-class military status on the nation in the hope of averting further Japanese expansion into mainland Asia. Both approaches eventually resulted in exactly the opposite of what was intended. As one historian noted, 'From an economic point of view, the First World War was won by the United States and Japan.' 
30
Also in Asia the hopes of tiny Vietnam for independence from France were dashed when the plank of self-determination for ethnic minorities in the old European empires in Wilson's Fourteen Points was declared to apply only to the small nations of Europe and not to Europe's colonies. Rejected by Wilson at Versailles, the Vietnamese delegation abandoned any faith in liberal internationalism and turned instead to the Soviet Union and its promise to assist Europe's colonies in their efforts to win national independence from their imperial overlords. The nucleus of Vietnam's communist party was engendered by World War I, as were many national independence movements throughout the colonized world, and the political forces of communism and nationalism would eventually confront the United States decades later at the very moment it moved to assume global hegemony.
In south-west Asia the long-tottering Turkish Empire had collapsed as a result of Allied victory, thus leaving much of the Middle East up for grabs. After the war it was revealed that even before the war both France and Britain had conspired secretly to carve up Turkey's holdings between themselves. The region's importance to Europe's victorious empires was magnified tremendously when oil was discovered in Persia (present day Iran) shortly before 1914. Given its vast quantities oil was cheaper than coal. As the competition between Germany and Britain had heated up and as inventions in war-making such as submarines and torpedoes had advanced the arms race, the British came to realize that oil-powered vessels could be made much faster, and thus be strategically better.

President Franklin Roosevelt, 1940 (Goodwin, 1994)   If we see that Germany is winning the war we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and in that way let them kill as many as possible.
Senator Harry S. Truman, 1941 (Jones, 2008)   America must not be allowed to pick out the eyes of the British Empire.
John Maynard Keynes (Layne, 2006)   Many thousands of volumes and articles have been written about American involvement in World War II, yet at the popular level it remains the most mythologized of the nation's wars, portrayed, even to this day, in rapturous terms as the 'Good War'. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 functions in popular culture as the perfect paradigm for the American way of war. Accordingly, treacherous, devious, cunning enemies are always on the horizon planning their perfi dies against the innocent, freedom-loving peoples of the United States and others, against which the American people ride to the rescue. In the conventional fantasy Japan slyly undermined peaceful diplomacy and forced the American people into a war they did not want, whose government had employed every means to avoid. Left with no alternative Americans awakened from their 'isolationism', put their democratic energies and commitment to liberty to work and, with the aid of allies, defeated the monstrous evils of Nazism and Japanese militarism. In the process the US also put an end to the Nazi program of genocide against the Jews and others, saved millions of lives and emerged as the global defender of freedom and human rights. The real story is hardly so starry-eyed. FDR's assumption of unprecedented wartime powers led directly to what historians today agree has become an 'imperial presidency'. Civil liberties domestically were dealt a severe blow with the incarceration in concentration camps of Japanese-Americans in a wholesale negation of constitutional protections. Though many citizens believe that riding to the rescue of Europe's Jews was at the top of the American agenda, the truth is that the fate of Jews was ignored and even deliberately hidden from the public. Despite popular beliefs that Hitler's death camps were unknown until the last stages of the war, the FDR Administration knew of them as early as 1942. Despite entreaties by American Jewish leaders, FDR refused either to ransom Jews from Nazi occupied Europe, or to bomb the death camps and crematoria in order to thwart Hitler's 'fi nal solution'. There is also the terribly ugly matter of American corporate complicity in the rise of the Nazis before the war and the morally worse employment of Nazi and Japanese war criminals after victory for their use in the new Cold War against the Soviets.
The alliance with the Soviet Union, without which the Nazis could not have been defeated, unraveled immediately at the end of the war when suddenly the public was manipulated to re-envision Stalin as Hitler's replacement. The effort by the US to acquire the world's fi rst atomic weapons led to the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a vicious attack upon a country that American offi cials knew to be on the verge of surrender. The atomic bombings were perceived as a dire threat and message to the Soviets who immediately stepped up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons themselves, and both nations squared off in a deadly arms race that threatened the future of human civilization itself. In one of history's inevitable ironies the defeat of Germany and Japan opened the way for communist domination in Eastern Europe and China, paved the way for new full scale wars in Korea and Vietnam and numerous smaller but deadly confl icts all over the globe.
The United States emerged from the war as the most powerful nation in history, yet, despite its claims to have served as the arsenal and vanguard of democracy, it began to ally with and prop up rightwing dictatorships on every continent and to suppress independent nationalist movements of all stripes, including democratic ones.
In the fi nal analysis the US entered World War II by stealth, not to redress the crimes committed by Axis powers such as saving Jews, liberating enslaved peoples and fostering democracy, but to preserve the mainstay of American foreign policy -the Open Door to the resources, markets and labor power of the territories that were threatened with closure. Popular culture maintains that the oft-repeated ideals were the nation's primary motivations but the genuine circumstances surrounding the war's outcome belie such mythology.
We did not go to war because we were attacked at Pearl Harbor. I hold rather that we were attacked at Pearl Harbor because we had gone to war.
Arthur Sulzberger, Publisher, New York Times, 1941
President Roosevelt was like the physician who has to tell his patient lies for the patient's own good. Thomas E. Bailey, American Historian
The standard interpretation of US entry into the war begins with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Yet the US policy of neutrality from 1935 on was constantly undermined and after 1938 FDR's policies amounted to acts of war. The full embargo of oil and steel to Japan and the covert but very real naval war in the North Atlantic against the Nazis in 1941 were but the strongest examples and were certainly taken by the Axis as evidence of American intent to enter the war.
Japan's attack on the American bases in Hawaii has become the legendary archetype of the 'American way of war' which holds that the US departs from the path of peace only when the misdeeds of others leave no alternative. The historical record clearly indicates that the Roosevelt Administration followed policies that effectively left Japan with two choices, what Yale political scientist Bruce Russet, called Japan's 'Hobson's choice'. 
1
The fi rst option was not really possible since the Japanese military would never have accepted such a humiliation, and Washington policy-makers understood this. Therefore, war was essentially inevitable, and desired. When the president froze Japanese assets in the US, then embargoed vital oil and steel exports, then in August 1941, and again even more harshly just ten days before Pearl Harbor, issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw its troops from China and Indochina, 2 Japan's government concluded the US left a choice either to accede, and then suffer the certainty of a military coup, or go to war to protect the gains made over the previous decade. No serious politician could entertain any doubt about the choice Japan would make.
By the late 1930s, despite diplomatic niceties, most American policies aimed at forcing Japan to cease its expansionist efforts in Asia, not because they were brutal and defi ed all codes of morality (which they did, but so had British, French, and Dutch imperialism), but because Japanese imperialism interfered with American and European development plans for the region. Secretary of State Henry Stimson condemned the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 in clarion terms, yet he simultaneously belittled and averted the Philippines' call for independence.

Racism also played its long-standing traditional role. After the Japanese annexation of Manchuria (renamed Manchukuo), analysts in the US State Department worried that: white prestige throughout Asia would be dangerously shaken… and the underlying instinct of the Anglo-Saxons is to preserve the Anglo-Saxon breed against the rising tide of color….the common British and American attitude toward people of other colors is a fundamental factor in the present situation.

The US and Japan had been on a collision course since Commodore Perry's naval squadron fi rst appeared on Japan's horizon in 1853 and employed the threat of force to acquire a commercial treaty with Japanese shoguns, thereby impelling Japan to undergo a profound internal restructuring in order to beat western imperialists at their own game for her own protection. Japan's lightning rise to power in East Asia was startling and frightening to the US, given the primacy of the Open Door policy. By 1940 the US was defi nitely pushing Japan into a 'Hobson's choice', either to submit to rigid American demands to withdraw its army from East Asia or face the military might of what Admiral Isoruko Yamamoto recognized as a 'sleeping giant'. 
6
In 1939 Admiral James O. Richardson, Commander of the Pacifi c Fleet, was ordered by FDR to move the fl eet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. Simultaneously, American air and sea forces were beefed up in the Philippines, within striking distance of Japanese bases in Formosa (present day Taiwan). Both Richardson, and other navy and army offi cials, immediately warned that these actions would be seen as a grave provocation by the Japanese to which they might respond preemptively. Indeed, Admiral Kanji Kato, a former Japanese chief of staff, declared that American actions were like 'drawing a sword before a neighbor's house'.

When the US Navy began to draw up War Plan Orange after Japan's stunning defeats of China in 1895 and of Russia in 1905, it was clear to both sides that the newly acquired US base at Pearl Harbor would be the key to the outcome. Therefore, American commanders had always known that Pearl Harbor could be, and probably would be, the target of a surprise attack.

We now know that the code-decrypting system known as 'MAGIC' was providing substantial information on Japanese plans and decisions in the period immediately preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
15

17
Washington also knew from MAGIC intercepts that Japan would not accept the ultimatum to withdraw its troops from East Asia issued by Secretary Hull on FDR's orders in late November 1941, and that the Japanese had decided that war was their only solution. As a consequence all US Pacifi c commanders were issued a 'war warning' on 27 November when intelligence informed the US government that the Japanese carrier fl eet had left home waters. Admiral Stark issued the following statement to all navy commanders in the Pacifi c: 'Negotiations with Japan have ceased, and an aggressive move by Japan is expected within the next few days.' General Marshall dispatched similar warnings to army commanders, adding, 'The United States desires that Japan commit the fi rst overt act.' 
18
19
In addition, the FBI and Offi ce of Naval Intelligence had known for over a year that spies were operating out of the Japanese Consulate in Honolulu, maintaining careful surveillance on the islands' military facilities. They were transmitting key information back to Tokyo constantly, including detailed information about the berths of the carriers and battleships. Throughout 1941 the chief Japanese spy in Honolulu sent numerous reports to Tokyo providing clear maps and other information about the berths of US warships in Pearl Harbor. All of these transmissions were monitored by the FBI and naval intelligence.
FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, wanted to arrest the spies but was deterred by Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle, who emphasized that such detention would reveal the fact that Japanese codes had been broken. 'No expulsion is possible as any charge leading to ouster would reveal American crytographic success to Japan.' 
20

And yet neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short were allowed the clearances necessary to read such transmissions themselves, even though a decoding station was in Hawaii itself. Instead these messages were sent directly to Washington. Both Kimmel and Short believed that if Japanese communications indicated an attack on Hawaii they would be duly notifi ed. The result was that even though the war warning applied to all Pacifi c commands, both Hawaiian commanders were led to believe the expected attack would occur against the Philippines. Though the Japanese did attack the American bases in the Philippines, only to have attacked these bases would have been militarily illogical and useless.
These are critical issues. Had the real motivation been to prevent an attack at Pearl Harbor then any and all measures necessary ought to have been taken. When the US embargoed oil and steel, froze Japanese assets and then on 26 November issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw all forces from China and Indochina, it was throwing down the gauntlet. Washington's effort at breaking and reading Japanese codes, and especially the desire to protect the knowledge, is a key indicator of an offi cial belief that war was sooner or later to be inevitable. Preventing Japan from gaining knowledge of American cryptographic success by not arresting its spies known to be reconnoitering for an attack speaks of a long-range plan to wage just such a war, and to maintain the all-important strategic and tactical advantages of such a tool. In the event, the US naval victory at Midway, only six months after Pearl Harbor, was made possible by MAGIC. Later, MAGIC's ability to decipher and read Japanese plans led American air forces to kill Admiral Yamamoto in mid-fl ight, thus depriving Japan of what was probably her best strategic thinker. Never, in three and a half years of war, did Japan learn of American code-breaking advantages.
To their credit, after receiving the war warning of 27 November, the senior navy and army commanders on Hawaii, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short, attempted to protect their respective bases using tactics that made basic sense. Kimmel wanted to deploy his carriers to patrol waters to the west of Hawaii, anticipating correctly that any attack would come from that direction. Washington ordered him not to place his fl eet in a position that would 'precipitate Japanese action'. Then he was ordered by Washington instead to use these vessels to dispatch army aircraft to Wake and Midway (a third aircraft carrier was sent to San Diego for repairs), a move that removed the vital carriers from Pearl Harbor and reinforced strategically useless mid-Pacifi c bases. Short was led to believe that sabotage in Hawaii was the main problem so he kept his army aircraft in concentrated airstrips with increased ground security. Both of these men knew that US cryptographers had broken some vital Japanese codes and they had been privy to some messages, but both senior offi cers took offi cial countermeasures from their superiors to mean that Washington did not seriously anticipate an attack at Pearl Harbor. They assumed that if their superiors had intelligence that an attack was forthcoming they would be warned directly. That is one reason the island's defenses were down that fateful morning of 7 December 1941, though given the general war admonition better defensive and precautionary measures should have been in place.
Short's air force was destroyed on the ground as planes sat wingtip to wingtip. Kimmel's carrier airplanes were no longer present. The offi cial explanation for the absence of the carriers has always been that Washington wished to beef up defenses elsewhere in the Pacifi c, but that line of argument makes no sense given that if Japan had attacked those tiny bases she would still be at war with the US but without having infl icted the crippling blow Yamamoto said was necessary for Japan's strategy to be fulfi lled. One thing is certain: two of those three carriers were present at the critical Battle of Midway six months later, where intelligence gathered by MAGIC allowed the US to draw the main fl eet of the Japanese into a trap and into a resounding defeat that broke the back of Japan's entire strategic offensive. Washington was in possession of critical information indicating an attack at Pearl Harbor. Was a decision made to ensure the critical carriers would survive? Naval warfare had changed radically. Most naval battles were to be won or lost by sea-launched airpower. After Midway, where the carriers spared in Hawaii played a crucial role, Japan's strategic offensive was halted. Thereafter it waged an entirely defensive war, though it would take three more years and tens of thousands of American lives to dislodge Japanese forces from their Pacifi c island redoubts. 
23
Another extremely curious set of facts involves the events in the Philippines only eight hours after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Once Oahu was bombed an all-out alert was transmitted so it was certain that US forces in the Philippines knew that the US was at war. Their commander was General Douglas MacArthur, who had for years been in charge of preparing the islands' defenses. His orders, in the event of war with Japan but never carried out, were to bomb Japanese bases in Formosa, Indochina, and China. When the Japanese attacked the Philippines only eight hours after events at Pearl Harbor his subordinates begged him to get US aircraft off the ground to counterattack. For reasons never explained, MacArthur refused to give these orders and the American air forces in the Philippines were destroyed on the ground where they were concentrated like those at Hawaii, wingtip to wingtip.
These forces may not have been able to stop the Japanese takeover of the Philippines but no attempt was made. Nor did they attempt to carry out the mission assigned -to bomb Japanese airbases in range. As a result of the Japanese victory in the Philippines, tens of thousands of American and Filipino troops were taken prisoner in what has come to be called the Bataan Death March, many of them to die horrible deaths from beatings and starvation, in what became the worst single defeat in American military history in terms of loss of life, worse even than Pearl Harbor. Yet, not only was MacArthur not punished or humiliated, as both Kimmel and Short were, he was promoted and given the Congressional Medal of Honor, though his lieutenants at the scene said that MacArthur had never emerged from his fortifi ed command center into the line of fi re, the ostensible requirement for the honor. 
24
One of the most deeply entrenched myths of World War II is that Germany had the potential to assume such overlordship itself, or that both Germany and Japan together could have 'taken over the world'. A widely viewed 1942 propaganda fi lm using trick footage by noted Hollywood director Frank Capra actually depicted Japanese troops marching down Constitution Avenue in Washington. 
25
The American public majority was clearly against intervention either in Europe or Asia before the 'day of infamy' at Pearl Harbor. Interventionists employed rhetoric much like their forebears before World War I, focusing their arguments on the real and terrible atrocities being committed by the Nazis and Japanese military, employing traditional platitudes about freedom of the seas, free trade and free markets and emphasizing that only the United States could be an 'arsenal of democracy' to avert a future of global totalitarianism. President Franklin Roosevelt had been ardently in the interventionist camp in 1917 but as the most pragmatic of politicians he could not ignore the deep and widespread public opposition to intervening in the European or Asian wars. A clear majority of Americans believed that the US had achieved nothing except a long casualty list from its participation in World War I. Many believed that Wall Street and industrialists had spurred US entry in order to profi t themselves. As a result of a congressional investigation into arms profi teering during the fi rst war, the term 'merchants of death' entered the American lexicon to describe the most prominent American corporations. Roosevelt's policies, many of them secret, show him to be clearly moving toward direct intervention in Europe but he could not show his hand overtly. He constantly reassured the public that 'Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars', even as his policies moved inexorably toward that outcome. Behind the scenes he clearly manipulated policies and events in such a way as to move the nation ever closer to a cause for war.
This assertion is vigorously denied by FDR's defenders but the record, as it has progressively come to light, clearly indicates a desire for war on the part of the nation's elites, of whom Roosevelt was a hereditary member and whose interests he had served throughout his career. The only germane question is 'Why did the American establishment desire war when there was clearly no military threat to the national security of the United States?'
The essential answer is that those driving intervention believed that to preserve 'free market' capitalism at home, to restore something like full employment, to prevent the collapse of existing political institutions, the US would have to re-establish domestic prosperity and to do that it would be necessary to reorder the global system. The goals of both the Nazis' 'New Order' in Europe, and the Japanese 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' were in fl at out contradiction to the maintenance of American foreign trade and investment on American terms and to the American system domestically. If the long range goal of American foreign policy was to be realized, an Open Door to the markets, resources and labor requisite for corporate profi ts, the entire global system would have to be 'Americanized'. 
26
In 1940, at FDR's urging, the democratically-controlled Congress implemented a fi ercely unpopular conscription law, initiated a program of massive ship and aircraft construction, and amended neutrality laws to allow FDR's Lend-Lease program to Britain. The Neutrality Act was passed in 1935 to ensure that the US would not follow the path of 1914-1917. By 1939, after Hitler launched his blitzkrieg across western Europe, Roosevelt's actions moving the US away from neutrality, indeed toward undeclared warfare, gave Germany much the same grounds for open war as had the American pretense at neutrality in 1917.
Unable to pay for American arms Britain's Prime Minister Churchill begged for credit, claiming falsely that if the British Isles fell the Royal Navy would fall into Hitler's hands, thus giving him mastery of the Atlantic.

Neither Germany nor Japan had the remotest chance to invade, much less occupy, the US. Former Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels said that 'I can hardly believe that it would be possible for any man to be crazy enough to invade this hemisphere.'

FDR continually emphasized that a Germany in control of the territory and resources of the European heartland, and friendly trading partners or allies in Latin America, might at some future point become a military threat. The claim, however, that the British navy would surrender its ships was false; measures had already been taken to remove it to the western hemisphere should England itself have fallen to Nazi invasion. More importantly, in the air war over the English Channel known as the Battle of Britain, occurring in the summer of 1940, more than a full year before Pearl Harbor, the Royal Air Force roundly defeated Nazi air power, thereby ensuring that no invasion of Britain could take place. Having failed to cross about 30 nautical miles to invade a small island, Hitler was hardly capable of transiting 3,000 miles of the Atlantic to fall upon New York or Washington.
The US continental territory was under no direct military menace from either of the two most powerful Axis nations. Nor did Germany or Japan desire war with the US. Nazi leaders certainly remembered that Germany had been forced to seek the adverse armistice in World War I because of late American entry into that war and that had led to German collapse. Japanese offi cials were also well aware of the strength of the US; that was the primary reason they resorted to what they hoped would be a 'surprise' attack when they came to believe that their only choice was capitulation to American demands or war. The ensuing confl ict resulted from a defi nition of national security primarily in economic terms and military strategies designed to support that economic agenda, as defi ned by elites, including FDR, a Columbia-trained Wall Street attorney and former Undersecretary of the Navy.
Japan's rise to modernity had been meteoric, spurred by fear of conquest and subordination by the western powers, including the US. Japan's humiliation of Russia in 1904-1905 alarmed American naval offi cials, leading them to draw up 'War Plan Orange' and bolster military bases in Hawaii and the Philippines, measures Japan saw as threatening. Both sides drew up contingency plans for a Pacifi c war and both recognized the US base at Pearl Harbor, where the American fl eet would be concentrated, as the key to victory. 
34

The Open Door originally envisioned untrammeled access to the resources, labor and markets of East Asia. But Japan closed the door to American trade in Manchuria in 1932. While many Americans decried Japanese atrocities in China, neither these nor the breakup of China's territory were at the heart of policy concerns. In 1935 President Franklin Roosevelt declared that 'the American people would not go to war to preserve the integrity of China' but the US would go to war to maintain 'their right to trade with China'. 
36
If these setbacks for US policy were not bad enough, worse things were transpiring: Europe as a whole encompassed the bulk of American trade and Germany was the largest trading partner. As one response to the Great Depression, newly elected President Franklin Roosevelt hoped to open new markets for American exports and renew older ones. He considered 'foreign markets as vitally important to the successful function of corporate capitalism'. But Germany was negatively affected by the global depression too and because of its unfavorable trade balance with the US and severe weakness of its currency, the Reichmark, adopted bilateral barter agreements with its other trading partners. By the mid-1930s such agreements with Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay had, said Secretary of State Cordell Hull, 'artifi cially displaced our Latin American trade'. 
37
38
39
By the late 1930s the nation's fi nancial elite reasoned that the real threat to American security lay elsewhere. Analysts at the Council on Foreign Relations stressed that 'Only by preserving a trade area that is even wider than the Western hemisphere and Britain can our economy face the future with assurance.' 40 Treasury Secretary Morganthau said: 'The Germans will form a sort of overall trading corporation and what are we to do about our cotton and wheat?' Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long stated that, 'If Germany wins this war and subordinates Europe every commercial order will be routed to Berlin and fi lled under its orders somewhere in Europe rather than in the United States.'

There were some infl uential analysts within FDR's circle of advisers, like Vice President Henry Wallace, who argued that the US could reorganize its economy toward hemispheric self-suffi ciency with Canada and the British imperial markets, but that would have entailed draconian state control over economic life. That potentiality was anathema to the majority of policy-makers.
FDR's repeated circumventions of the Neutrality Act clearly favored the British and French again, as in World War I, although certainly not for altruistic reasons, as the reduction of both nations virtually to vassal states after World War II showed. In 1941 Roosevelt secretly ordered the American Navy to begin actively assisting British warships in their military actions against German submarines. At fi rst such activities were confi ned to helping British ships locate the submarines, but before long the US vessels were fi ring on the German ships too. The result was that a number of US Navy vessels engaged in open combat in the North Atlantic with Germany, leading to the loss of American life. Roosevelt called the subs the 'rattlesnakes of the sea' and attempted to persuade the public that Germany had attacked fi rst. However, he was undermined by his own Navy Secretary who told the New York Times the truth; it was US vessels that had violated American neutrality. Harold Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, wrote to a subordinate: 'The Navy is already in the war in the Atlantic, but the country doesn't seem to realize it...Whether the country knows it or not, we are at war.' 
46
While the president's and the nation's fi nanciers' attention was fi xed upon Europe's markets as the largest source of America's export dollars, the great China market remained of vital concern. Insisting that Japan's Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere must be stopped, Morgenthau declared:
As our own population becomes more intense, as we feel increasingly the need of foreign markets, our defi nite concern for open markets will be more widely felt among our people and our desire for and insistence upon free opportunity to trade with and among the peoples of the Far East will be intensifi ed. For in that region lie the great potential markets of the future. 
47
With a population of more than 400 million China is the biggest single potential market in the world. A strong China, able and willing to protect the principle of the open market in the Far East, would be worth billions of dollars to the United States. 
48
And the cure [for failure in US foreign policy] is this: to accept wholeheartedly our duty and our opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world and in consequence to exert upon the world the full impact of our infl uence, for such purposes as we see fi t and by such means as we see fi t…
Our thinking of world trade today is on ridiculously small terms. For example, we think of Asia as being worth only a few hundred millions a year to us. Actually, in the decades to come Asia will be worth to us exactly zero -or else it will be worth to us four, fi ve, ten billions of dollars a year. And the latter are the terms we must think in, or else confess a pitiful impotence.

In the annals of wartime suffering and atrocity, the Holocaust and atomic bombings are at the top of the list. As a university teacher I often encounter young students who have been taught that one of the primary motivations for the US to enter the war was to 'save the Jews', and also that the atomic bombings were necessary to save American lives in a land invasion planned for November. These beliefs do not stand up to evidence.
American Jewish leaders struggled constantly to keep the plight of their European kin in the public eye. Throughout the Great Depression American public opinion was steadfastly opposed to allowing immigration for Nazi refugees, ostensibly on the rationale that they would compete with Americans for scarce jobs and resources. Yet British refugees, especially children, were admitted, while Jewish children were denied. In the particularly tragic and well-known case of the SS St. Louis over 1,200 Jewish refugees actually arrived just off American shores begging Congress to amend immigration restrictions and quotas, only to be turned back to Germany. Subsequent research showed that most were later interned in death camps, including 300 children.
The American population at that time was primarily of European origin and many European immigrants brought their traditional anti-Semitism with them to American shores, so the sort of prejudice abounding in Europe existed in the US as well. State Department posts were fi lled with people from the traditionally Anglo-Saxon upper classes of American society who believed fervently in the racial superiority of 'Nordic' peoples, and many high offi cials deliberately blocked proposals to aid or rescue Jews in Nazi occupied territories, and even in neutral countries. Yet as early as 1941 the outlines of what the Nazis termed the 'fi nal solution' were clear and mass killings had already begun in occupied Poland and Ukraine. In that year at least 700,000 Jews had been killed, mainly by fi ring squad. Private individuals confi rmed the establishment of the death camps and this information was relayed to the US State Department.
Roosevelt himself, who showed no personal anti-Jewish bias and had appointed Jews to high positions in the US government, temporized so as not to infl ame anti-Semitic sentiment that would injure his political fortunes. Jewish leaders proposed ransoming Jews but this was denied with the argument that giving money to Hitler would only help his cause. Proposals were made to bomb the death camps arguing that since inmates would die anyway, the destruction of the railways leading to camps, the gas chambers and crematoria would probably result in more lives saved than lost. Military offi cials claimed that aircraft could not be spared from military objectives but many bombing campaigns were conducted against oil refi neries and other targets near the more infamous camps, especially Auschwitz, yet no bombs were spared to destroy gas chambers. It was not until the last year of the war that the US government made any moves that resulted in saving Jews. These came in Hungary and Rumania primarily where Nazi defeats made this possible. Of the millions who were facing death, only perhaps 200,000 Jews were ultimately rescued by these late measures though earlier actions probably would have saved many more. Even after the war, when American popular magazines reported on the atrocities with grim photos, public opinion remained opposed to increasing the level of Jewish immigration. Of the number actually rescued only about 21,000 were admitted to the US. Jewish leaders in Congress who proposed measures allowing many more thousands to enter the US were vilifi ed and condemned for taking the part of 'refujews'. Some of their congressional opponents spewed anti-Semitic vitriol on the very fl oor of the House of Representatives and appealed to public opinion to ensure that Jewish refugees would not enter the US or Britain in great numbers. One reason that the state of Israel was supported and created by allied post-war leaders was precisely to prevent large numbers from settling in the United States and England. 
50
A central tenet of American ideology surrounding World War II is that the atomic bombings were necessary to save American lives and end the war without having to invade the Japanese home islands. President Harry Truman, who replaced FDR upon his death on 12 April 1945, declared as much when he informed the American people of the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. In subsequent years he and former Secretary of War Henry Stimson were to state that upwards of 1 million American lives had been saved by the use of the A-bombs. At Hiroshima and Nagasaki at least 170,000 civilians died almost instantly and another 200,000, perhaps many more, died later from their injuries or radiation poisoning.
No documentary evidence ever existed to support the claims made about American lives. Most American soldiers and citizens were being led to believe that, like the invasion of Europe, landings in Japan itself would be likely. While there were contingency plans to invade Japan in November 1945, and possibly again in March 1946, the Japanese were on the verge of surrender in the summer of 1945. The most pessimistic estimates of American casualties potentially resulting from these possible invasions were lower than the claims made by Truman and others, though no one at the time desired any casualties. But in the last phase of the war MAGIC intercepts confi rmed Japanese recognition of defeat and a desire to capitulate under what they considered to be honorable terms. The main obstacle to conceding defeat was the American insistence on 'unconditional surrender'. To the Japanese this meant that the emperor would be subject to trial and execution as a war criminal. Many American military leaders believed that dropping the demand for unconditional surrender and guaranteeing the safety and continued reign of the emperor would have ended the war as early as June 1945. They also believed that insistence upon the demand prolonged the war, thereby leading to continuing American casualties. Joseph Grew, the former ambassador to Japan, who was then Acting Secretary of State, said candidly that 'our intention to try the emperor as a war criminal will insure prolongation of the war and cost a large number of human lives'. Admiral William Leahy, the highest ranking offi cer and Truman's Chief of Staff, said that 'insistence on unconditional surrender would result only in making the Japanese desperate and thereby increase our casualty lists'. Even Army Chief of Staff, General George Marshall, warned against crystallizing the 'phraseology "unconditional surrender"'.
A careful analysis of attitudes prevalent at the time among all offi cials close to the decision to use the bombs shows clearly that the military general staff did not believe the bombs were necessary for victory, and many of the most prominent, including General Dwight Eisenhower and Leahy, thought that their employment was 'barbaric' and 'inhuman'. Even General Curtis Lemay, the leader of the infamous attack on Tokyo in March 1945 in which napalm fi rebombs destroyed half the city and killed at least 100,000 people, stated that 'the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war'. It was civilian decision-makers, more concerned about how the bomb could be used as a tool to shape the post-war order, who insisted on its use.

As war neared its culmination, the issue of Soviet entry into the war against Japan began to obsess key American leaders. Roosevelt had always believed he could deal with Stalin, but Truman was refl exively anti-communist and surrounded himself with men equally, or more, hostile to the Soviet Union. The war against Nazi Germany had ended in early May and the US and USSR were already at loggerheads over the division of Europe's territory, and the possibility that the same dispute would occur in East Asia loomed menacingly. Having fought Japan over China and East Asia in general, American leaders had reluctantly accepted the necessity of Soviet entry, since that would surely end Japanese resistance and save American lives. But they were not happy at having to share the spoils with the communists. Circumstances changed fundamentally when scientists in the US Manhattan Project informed Truman and his advisers that they had successfully tested the world's fi rst atomic bomb. Now the US had the most devastating weapon in history to end the war on its terms, without the necessity of Soviet participation; now they could induce Japan to surrender before the Red Army could overrun much of northern China and Korea, and, most especially, before it could occupy parts of Japan itself. 
53
New research has shown that the Soviets very much desired to occupy the northern part of Japan as vengeance for the humiliating defeat of 1905, when Japan annexed Russian territories in the Far East, and to benefi t their strategic position. 
54
Stalin declared to his associates that he was shocked by the Abombings. Since his spies knew that the atomic program existed this seems curious. As one of history's most brutal dictators one would think that little could shock such a man. He seems to have been taken aback by the use of the weapons upon an already defeated nation, on helpless civilians, because now he knew that the US could be as ruthless as himself. The atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki certainly ended World War II but they were also the fi rst round in the coming Cold War. One nation now possessed a weapon of awesome and terrifying power. No other nation at odds with the US could fail to be intimidated by the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Soviets, for their part, immediately stepped up all efforts to acquire nuclear weapons themselves and the most dangerous arms race in history was on.
Thus did history's most destructive war end. Though nearly 400,000 Americans died in World War II, this was by far the lowest casualty rate of any of the major combatants, owing in part to the enormous advantages of US fi repower. A striking example of this is the ratio of American combat deaths at Iwo Jima, 7,500 to 20,000 Japanese deaths. It took the US approximately 25,000 rounds of ammunition, ranging from M-1 bullets to 18 inch naval shells, to kill one Japanese soldier in that month-long battle.
In the Atlantic theater of war the US also fought in such a way as to ensure that its allies did most of the fi ghting -and dying. To be sure, the US entered the war late and was not yet fully mobilized. Meanwhile, Britain and especially the USSR were on their own as far as combat troops were concerned, but were supplied with vital trucks, weapons and food by Lend-Lease. Stalin urgently desired that a European front be opened by British and American troops as soon as possible in order to alleviate the terrible burdens faced by the Red Army. More than two-thirds of Hitler's legions were concentrated against the Soviet Union. These troops constituted the best of Nazi forces and the USSR soundly defeated them without the direct combat assistance of American or British forces. However, the costs and consequences to the USSR were profound.
The primary motivation for US entry into the war was the prospect that Germany would dominate most of the European continent and the oil reserves of the Middle East, and establish a closed continental system that would exclude most American trade and investment, a 'nightmare' scenario from the perspective of American policymakers. Yet there was no possibility of defeating Hitler without an alliance with the Soviet Union. The American public forgets, or the reality has been consistently downplayed, that the Soviets did most of the dying to defeat Hitler. Had the Red Army not bogged down the bulk of Nazi legions in a desperate struggle in eastern Europe there would have been absolutely no prospect of the invasion of western Europe on the beaches of Normandy by American and allied forces. This meant that at war's end the Soviets, with a system as antithetical to US objectives as the Nazi program had been, would be in control of much territory that Washington wanted liberated from Hitler's grasp. This eventuality was not lost on planners, and much evidence abounds that offi cial Washington was preparing for a showdown with its erstwhile ally well before the war ended.
Unlike its allies and enemies alike, the US suffered no devastation to its territory; it also endured by far the fewest casualties. Indeed, at the war's end the US was far richer than when it entered, and because all others had spent themselves, it emerged as the dominant power on the planet. As such the United States moved rapidly to reconstruct a global order to serve the long-standing goal of an Open Door to world resources and markets. There were at least two major obstacles to this goal: the opposition of the communists to the expansion of western capitalism and the worldwide revolt of the defeated imperial colonies.
There were domestic issues too. Even before the end of the war the specter of mass unemployment and a return to depression surfaced again. In 1944, Charles Wilson, former chief of General Electric, and FDR's wartime production tsar, had worried about the 16 million GIs who would shortly return to civilian life. Would breadlines await them?

The United States was master of the earth. No England, no France, no Germany, no Japan left to dispute the Republic's will. Only the mysterious Soviet would survive to act as the balance in the scale of power. Gore Vidal (Vidal, 1967)   There was never from about two weeks from the time I took charge of this project any illusion on my part but that Russia was our enemy and the project was conducted on that basis. General Leslie Groves, Military Director of the Manhattan Project, 1942 (Takaki, 1995)   I do not know any responsible offi cial, military or civilian, in this government or any government, who believes that the Soviet government now plans conquest by open military aggression.
John Foster Dulles, 1949 (Lens and Zinn, 2003)   The geo-political struggle and arms race with the communist world known as the Cold War lasted so long (1945-1991), and was so fraught with existential danger to human civilization, that it is often forgotten that the United States and Soviet Union had been allies against Nazi Germany. Strategic as it was, this alliance came down to a marriage of expediency and no sooner had the dust of war settled than the erstwhile confederates confronted each other over the spoils of victory. At war's end the United States' continental territory was untouched and it was by far the wealthiest and most powerful nation on the planet. The Soviet Union, where most of the European fi ghting had been waged, lay in ashes with 30 million dead. With their common enemies prostrate the two allies briefl y had a positive opportunity for a workable compromise over military and economic issues, and thus for a more peaceful future. But peace was not on the horizon. After World War II anti-communism became the watchword of the day and the Soviets were demonized as entirely responsible for the state of tension that unfolded dangerously and rapidly. Neither side was blameless but the record clearly shows more effort at conciliation by Moscow than by Washington. Unwilling to acknowledge that the USSR had vital national security issues far more pressing than their own, advocates of a permanent military establishment and Open Door to the markets of Eastern Europe and East Asia claimed that the Soviets and Chinese communists had replaced the Nazis and imperial Japan as the threats to the 'American way of life'. On the basis of this claim they militarized American society as never before.
In American popular culture World War II is seen as the victory of democracy over German and Japanese dictatorship, with the United States playing the major role. There is no denying that US military fi repower defeated Japan. Indeed, American war planners never doubted victory. Americans have been loath, however, to accept less than full credit for triumph over Nazi Germany. Certainly the American Lend-Lease program provided Britain and the Soviet Union with essential resources, including arms, and the massive American and British aerial bombardment of German factories and cities contributed to Hitler's downfall. But in terms of ground combat and the defeat of millions of Nazi soldiers, the Soviet Red Army was indisputably central. The war on Europe's eastern front was far more destructive and savage than in the west and millions of soldiers and civilians on both sides perished. More than two-thirds of Hitler's legions were concentrated against the Soviets, where they fought a desperate and losing effort to keep the Red Army at bay. When German forces entered the Soviet Union in 1941 they committed atrocities on a colossal scale, including the roundup and systematic extermination of Jews, and the slaughter of many other civilians. By late 1942 the Red Army had reversed Germany's fortunes and in 1945 broke through into Germany itself and began to exact an equally atrocious retribution.
It is often forgotten too, deliberately omitted, that when the Nazis conquered states in Eastern Europe they subordinated their governments and forged military alliances with these puppet regimes. The result was that Hungarian, Ukrainian, Romanian and other pro-Nazi troops invaded Soviet Russia alongside the Germans as partners. 
1
The overwhelming majority of Hitler's best troops had been locked in mortal struggle in the east. Thus, when the US fi nally, in the last year of war, was able to employ its vast wealth of resources to mount the largest seaborne invasion force in history on the north coast of France, the effort succeeded only because the least combat experienced, and fewest, Nazi troops were there as defenders. Had the bulk of Nazi forces not been bogged down in the east they would have been on the beaches of France and therefore no such invasion would have been possible or even considered. Hitler could not have been defeated without the Soviet Union. Had he confi ned his effort to conquering western Europe, and not attacked Russia, Europe's recent history would be very different.
But Hitler had made it supremely clear in his book Mein Kampf that he intended to extend German living space (lebensraum) to the Slavic east and to defeat communism once and for all. The Soviet system had only recently been stabilized after years of civil war and internal communist party purges. Stalin feared that the western European powers might align with Germany against him. Since he desired no such war he allied with 
Hitler in 1939. 2
In short order the Truman Administration claimed that the Soviets had now replaced the Nazis as the principal threat to global order and American national security. Less than three months after Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945 the enormously infl uential Life magazine startled readers with graphic depictions of a Soviet atomic missile attack on US cities, though pointedly the Soviets did not possess an atomic bomb, and intercontinental missiles did not exist and would not until 1957. Most mainstream publications followed suit with lurid depictions of what the USSR could do to the US despite its obvious weakness.

All of European Russia's major cities and towns, estimated at 70,000, were destroyed, its roads, and railways in ruins, its crops and livestock dead or stolen, and at least 30 million of its soldiers and civilians dead.

Uppermost on Stalin's agenda was rebuilding an utterly devastated nation and ensuring that invasion by a foreign enemy could never take place again. For Soviet foreign policy maintaining control of Eastern Europe as a bulwark, a cordon sanitaire, was indispensable against any possibility of incursion from the west. To safeguard their country and their rule the Soviets were more than willing to modify the doctrines of communism and world revolution. Had the Truman Administration been willing to acknowledge this profound need on the part of the Soviets, and to work with them to guarantee their security, the possibilities for subsequent cooperation might have proved invaluable to both nations. Genuinely frightened by American actions in the early Cold War, the Russians were goaded to intensify their own acquisition of atomic weapons, thereby ensuring that Soviet nuclear capabilities would become the very threat, and the only such threat, to American national security that propaganda had claimed but which had been utterly false.
As American offi cials intended, the atomic bombings of Japan had badly unnerved the Soviets. Not only were the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a warning that such destruction of entire cities and ruthlessness against helpless civilians could be visited elsewhere, they also ended the war abruptly on American terms, forestalling the USSR's occupation of Japan, to prevent any repeat of the problems inherent in the division of Germany.
The future of atomic weapons thus lay at the center of both nations' critical concerns. Many Americans, including leading atomic scientists who developed the bomb, had worried that nuclear weapons in the hands of one nation would induce a terrifying arms race that portended the annihilation of human civilization. The Soviets demanded the destruction of all existing atomic weapons, though no American offi cial believed they would stop their own program. To mollify domestic critics the Truman Administration created a special committee headed by Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson to advance policies for the control of such armaments and atomic energy in general. When this committee's proposals were deemed too soft, its recommendations were replaced by those of Wall Street baron, Barnard Baruch. The Baruch Plan demanded that the Soviets submit to international inspections and end their A-bomb project, then in its early stage, while the US would retain its atomic monopoly until satisfi ed no Soviet bomb would or could be created. Then, and only then, would the US reconsider whether or not to destroy its own bomb making capacity. It was, as a Baruch staff member conceded, 'obviously unacceptable to the Soviets with the full realization that they would reject it'. Acheson himself said that the Baruch Plan would guarantee the failure of international control of atomic weapons. The Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted only one dimension of control. 'The bomb should continue to be at the heart of America's arsenal, and a system of controls should be established that would prevent the Russians from developing the weapon.' The nuclear arms race, that on more than one occasion would bring the world to the brink of Armageddon, was on. 9
In early 1946 Winston Churchill made his famous 'Iron Curtain' speech 10 in the US in which he described what he termed the barbaric and illegitimate domination of Eastern Europe by the Soviets. Yet, as prime minister of Britain, and Stalin's ally, he had cut a bargain with the Soviet dictator himself by which Britain would recognize Soviet mastery throughout the east in return for Stalin's acknowledgement of Britain's continued sphere in Greece, a bargain Stalin kept. 
11
Similarly, the Soviets also withdrew from Chinese territory occupied when the Red Army declared war on Japan in 1945. In 1947 Truman issued his famous doctrine in which he accused the Soviets of intervening in Greece's civil war waged between native Greek communists and right-wing forces that had collaborated with the Nazis, and who were then also supported by Britain. But Stalin kept his word with Churchill and gave no aid to the Greek communists. That is precisely why the Greek communists were defeated.
In yet another case both Russia and Britain had occupied Iran and Azerbaijan in order to keep immense reserves of oil from Nazi control. FDR had assured Stalin that Russia could obtain Iranian oil for necessary reconstruction after the war. The Soviets agreed to withdraw from this area by March 1946, yet when the time came they balked; not because they wished to annex the region but to ensure that Iran would provide the USSR with oil. Initially the Truman Administration urged the Iranians to broker such an oil deal. At this early stage of American power Washington was already maneuvering to create a buffer between the USSR and Middle East oil, and saw Iran as pivotal. So, after the Soviets did withdraw Washington then told Iran to renege.

It is true that communist parties in western Europe, especially in France and Italy, were very strong and posed an electoral threat to the American reconstruction agenda in that region. Communists could rise to power there democratically and showed every sign of doing so, owing to widespread dissatisfaction with the regimes that had brought on war and ruin. Certainly the Soviets aided such political movements where they could, but given the Soviets' own domestic problems such assistance was minimal. The American response was to deploy the newly established Central Intelligence Agency to areas where electoral communist success was possible, there to employ every dirty trick available, including bribery, vote fraud and even assassination to prevent communist electoral success. In both France and Italy the CIA worked openly with organized crime to intimidate organized labor. Ironically the US accused the Soviets of thuggery. If democracy was to result in communist gains then democracy had to be jettisoned.
Americans are educated to take capitalism for granted as the only rational system of social and economic organization. The brutal and unjust history of capitalist evolution is all but censored. Indeed, while communist nations were usually derided as slave states, the fact that slavery and mass slaughter were indispensable ingredients of western capitalism's rise is not open for discussion, at least in mainstream forums. When communist ideas began to percolate into society they were both an intellectual and grass roots response to the very real depredations of capitalism. Clearly communist revolutions did not succeed in creating better societies for their peoples, as capitalist societies claim they do for their own. Soviet rule over its satellites was brutal. But if the capitalist west prospers greatly today it does so directly as an historical legacy of the early western conquest of much of the planet, a system erected as a result of genocide and slavery at its dawn and maintained by exploitation and war to this day. The west can and does vilify communist crimes. But there is nothing in the communist record not matched by capitalist societies in terms of crimes against humanity.
The record of capitalist larceny is why so many colonized peoples struggling for independence from western rule turned toward communist and socialist ideas in the aftermath of World War II; that, and their recognition that the European empires, and Japan, were fi nished. As victims they had fi rst hand knowledge of the west's hypocrisy and its claims to bring the benefi ts of civilization to the benighted denizens of what was condescendingly termed the 'Third World'. They knew that western nations prospered at their expense. Nationalists like Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh had seen fi rst hand the benefi cence of French capitalism and rejected it utterly. European colonizers employed noble rhetoric and platitudes but the realities involved plantations and mines that paid slave wages, a system backed by prisons and executions. The widely held notion that the US opposed communism on moral grounds is fl atly contradicted by the fact that throughout the Cold War Washington overthrew numerous democracies because they pursued policies in opposition to US intentions. In many cases the US fi lled these power vacuums with bloody dictatorships every bit as brutish and criminal as anything to be found in the communist world.
American policy-makers understood that World War II's costs in lives and treasure would all but bankrupt western Europe's empires, and Japan's, presenting the long anticipated opening to replace them, if not in exactly the same way. So the stage was set for a titanic struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for the loyalties of the former colonial subjects. This contest was one of the cardinal issues at the heart of American opposition to the communist world. Throughout the post-war era, until the collapse of the USSR in 1991, both sides would square off and on too many occasions would stand at the brink of nuclear war. At other times the two opponents would arm proxies such as Koreans, Vietnamese, Cubans, Angolans, Ethiopians and many others, and foster wars all over the planet such that by the end of the twentieth century almost as many people would die of these so-called 'savage wars of peace' as had been killed in World War II.

American policy faced a four-pronged threat: the ruined nations of Europe and Asia -both friends and former foes -might revert to the economic nationalism and closure of markets that had characterized the pre-war years. Post-war impoverishment in these regions might lead populations toward communism and socialism. Ruined nations could not buy American goods owing to their lack of dollars. Finally, the colonies were in revolt, threatening to align themselves with Moscow, or in nationalist directions otherwise independent of US desires.

US ambassador to the newly created United Nations, John Foster Dulles, said 'a healthy Europe' could not be 'divided into small compartments'. It had to be organized into 'an integrated market big enough to justify modern methods of mass production for mass consumption'.

Fundamental to American management of capitalist economies, and the military power to back it up, was control of the resource necessary to fuel the system. In the words of the US State Department oil had become 'a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history'. James Forrestal, who had directed the Navy Department during the war and would soon become the nation's fi rst Secretary of Defense, put matters quite baldly. 'Whoever sits on the valve of Middle East oil may control the destiny of Europe.' 20 George Kennan, architect of early anti-communist policy, wrote that 'US control over Japanese oil imports would help provide "veto power" over Japan's military and industrial policies.' 
21
Our petroleum policy is predicated on a mutual recognition of a very extensive joint interest and upon control…of the great bulk of the petroleum resources of the world…US-UK agreement upon the broad, forward-looking pattern of the development and utilization of petroleum resources under the control of the two countries is of the highest strategic and commercial importance.

As we have seen, the Middle East had been cynically carved up and occupied by Britain and France after World War I. Owing to the shock and cost of World War II both nations were losing their empires. Having ascended to the pinnacle of the system that had evolved by conquest, the US would shortly, in the name of countering communists but really in order to maintain its new position, be forced to intervene in the Middle East for strategic reasons and to ensure its access to and control over the disposition of vital oil. Solving these problems would require outlays of US tax revenues that would dwarf the costs incurred by the war itself, and if not managed tightly could lead back to depression.
The Truman Doctrine of 1947 committed the US to provide assistance to any nation at risk from communist movements or insurgencies, but it was also a major response to the economic uncertainties facing reconstruction of the global system. The capitalist British Empire had been the greatest impediment to American hegemony in the pre-war system. In another of history's ironies Prime Minister Churchill had allied with the US in order to save his nation's empire, only to see it bankrupted by victory. Britain had succumbed to classic 'imperial overstretch', 
23
The anti-communist propaganda of the Truman Doctrine also prepared the American public and Congress for even greater outlays of American dollars. Truman's message emphasized the communist threat to Greece, Turkey and the oil of the Middle East, but this was not entirely honest. Its deeper goal was to overcome political reluctance to extend massive loans for European recovery. As noted, Stalin was not interfering in the Greek civil war between communists and rightists. The aid thus extended by Truman defeated the Greek communists and lined the US up with a reactionary and dictatorial regime. There was no evidence that the Soviets were interfering in Turkey and that Muslim nations' communists were a weak minority in any case. As Chairman Arthur Vandenburg of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee told Truman, if he wanted Congress to put up the money he would have 'to scare hell out of the American people'. 
24
Named after Secretary of State George C. Marshall, the European Recovery Program is often presented as an impeccable example of American generosity towards war-ruined nations, including former enemies. But the plan was crafted primarily as a measure to resolve the 'dollar gap' crisis and restore the US economy and international trade. Prior to the depression and war, Europe and Japan had exported their products to the US and been paid in dollars, which these nations then used to import American products. In the post-war period European currencies and the Japanese yen were essentially worthless. In the absence of dollars to buy American goods, global trade could not be re-established and the US was in danger of falling back into depression, mass unemployment and social instability. The plan envisioned ultimately an integrated European Common Market, with a re-industrialized Germany at its core and a common currency easily converted into dollars. Billions of tax dollars would be pumped into ruined Europe (with a similar plan for Japan) and then be re-circulated back into the US to purchase reconstruction services and materials from American companies. The war-devastated nations would be rebuilt and American prosperity would return.
The key to European recovery, said American analysts, was Germany. Secretary Marshall declared that 'the restoration of Europe required the restoration of Germany. Without a revival of Germany's production there can be no revival of Europe's economy.' The chairman of General Motors, then the largest corporation in the world, said that without German integration into a common European market 'there is nothing that could convince us in General Motors that it was either sound or desirable or worthwhile to undertake an operation of any consequence in a country like France'.
France itself was adamantly opposed to re-industrializing the neighbor that had invaded it twice that century but was induced to accept the plan when it realized that the enormous reparations it desired from Germany could only be obtained if German industry was resurrected. France also fervently wanted to hold on to its empire, especially in North Africa and Indochina. To have any hope of success it would have to depend on the United States and would therefore be required to go along with the Marshall Plan.
Russia, however, was a very different case. Under no circumstances could the Soviet Union accept a reunifi ed Germany reconstructed along the lines that had enabled its rise as a military power in the fi rst place. Germany had also twice invaded Russian territory in one generation, with consequences far more extreme than for France. The USSR desperately needed aid, even more than the nations of western Europe, and at the fi nal allied conference at Potsdam had asked Truman for a $10 billion loan, having previously been promised $6 billion by FDR. Stalin took measures to cooperate with the US, such as allowing non-communists to share rule in strategic Poland and Czechoslovakia, by withdrawing troops from Austria, Manchuria and Iran, and by refraining to support communist movements in China, Greece and elsewhere. Washington had continued to dangle the possibility of the loan to Moscow without making any concrete guarantees. It never did extend the money.
In 1948 the US offered Marshall Plan aid to Czechoslovakia which had fallen under Nazi rule during the war when its puppet government had allied with Hitler. Nevertheless, that nation was allowed by Stalin to have elections in which non-communists shared power. Czechoslovakia straddled east and west and sought good relations with both sides. But it was clear that acceptance of Marshall Plan aid would tie the small nation's economy to the west and erode the cordon sanitaire that Soviet foreign policy saw as key to its national security. Rather than allow Czechoslovakia out of its orbit the Soviets ruthlessly toppled the non-communist government of Edward Benes and occupied the country. This was the fi rst military foray conducted by the Soviets after World War II, and it occurred in a nation that had been an enemy, and had previously been occupied by the Red Army. This move against the Czechs hardly portended the global conquest that Washington's propaganda insisted was the Soviet goal.
Had Italy at the time elected a communist government and showed signs of lining up with the USSR the United States would have overthrown that government (actually it would never have allowed any communists, elected or not, in the fi rst place). Nevertheless, Washington seized upon the Czech overthrow as perfect evidence of its own propaganda. The Reds were relentlessly seeking world conquest and would have to be 'contained'. The die was cast. The USSR would be denied reconstruction aid, it would be banned from the renewed global economic system and its proclaimed menace would be employed to justify rearmament in the US and Western Europe.
Critics of the European Recovery Plan in the US, like FDR's former vice-president Henry Wallace, dubbed it the 'Martial Plan'.

The years 1948-1950 were critical to the evolution of American Cold War policies and the future of American democracy. The crucial issue of Germany heated nearly to atomic warfare over the capital city of Berlin; the Chinese communists overthrew the regime the US had propped up against Japan; the Soviets exploded their fi rst atomic bomb; war in Korea broke out suddenly, and across the globe the colonies were in open revolt. Panic gripped the Truman Administration while its right-wing opponents mounted a hysterical condemnation of the government's policies. Owing to its unpopularity, the draft laws of World War II had been allowed to lapse but on 24 June 1948 Congress instituted a new Selective Service Act that would conscript able-bodied males for compulsory military service, not to defend American shores but once again to be deployed thousands of miles from home. 
27
The fate of Germany, split between the capitalist west and Soviet east, polarized the issues between the US and USSR. By 1948 it was clear that no compromise on Germany's reunifi cation could be reached that satisfi ed either side. When the US announced that it had created a separate currency for West Germany the Soviets decided to close the border between their zone, East Germany, and the West, halting any progress toward reunifi cation. The American intent was to foster re-industrialization and economic stability in West Germany such that it could begin importing American and western European products. This fl atly rendered null the agreement made at Yalta for Russian reparations from the wealthier, industri-alized western zone of Germany. The Soviets announced that the mutual co-government of Germany had come to a halt. The critical issue was Berlin, Germany's capital deep in the Soviet zone that had also been co-occupied and governed by the allies. Now the Soviets shut the access roads and rails leading to Berlin from the west. The US wanted German reunifi cation on terms that would make it an ally and stalwart economic partner. The Soviets wanted Germany rendered militarily impotent and that meant severe limits to German industrial capacity.
Rather than assent to what amounted to the permanent division of Germany, Washington initiated a risky airlift to Berlin to supply its forces and peoples in the western zone. American offi cials knew that Russia might take military action but reasoned that the US atomic monopoly would inhibit that possibility. General Lucius Clay, High Commissioner of the American zone, stated baldly that 'It is our view that they are bluffi ng and that their hand can and should be called now. They are defi nitely afraid of our air might.' 
28
29
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the fi rst formal treaty binding the United States to a military alliance with a foreign power, in this case numerous nations. Originally publicized as a means to contain the possibility of German resurgence, it was really a multi-pronged element in American post-war strategy for reconstructing a new global order, as well as confronting the USSR. As such it was the 'logical corollary to the Marshall Plan'. 
30
Such arms would for the foreseeable future be manufactured in the US by corporations which had produced armaments during the war and which had grown to gargantuan proportions as a result of tax-funded war contracts. Reliant on guaranteed profi ts from government during the war these companies now faced insolvency owing to the disappearance of demand for massive quantities of ships, aircraft, tanks, trucks and a myriad of other products. Yet these very fi rms, and the satellite industries that fed them, had become integral to the American economy and the maintenance of full employment. With 16 million former servicemen looking for work, the downsizing or bankruptcy of major industrial companies posed the danger of a return to depression. Unless the demand could be re-invigorated. 
31
Key among public investments would be a massive 'G.I. Bill' that would provide free tuition and generous stipends for veterans to attend universities, colleges and technical institutions and thereby upgrade the skills and educational levels of millions, essential for future innovations and economic prosperity. This would go a long way towards warding off a return to mass unemployment and widespread discontent among those whose sacrifi ces had sustained the war. Simultaneously the same veterans would receive below market loans for mortgages. The 'baby boom' of the post-war years was rendering an already dilapidated and scarce housing stock insuffi cient. An immediate result was the growth of the construction industry and the overnight invention of suburbia. Such stimuli would foster numerous new industries to absorb the workforce and maintain American productivity, and ensure domestic tranquility, while the overseas restoration of capitalism would also ensure mutuality of trade. Since the keystone of the structure was the new politico-military-industrial complex, all that was needed to ensure perpetuation was to maintain permanent enemies.
Washington had already turned Russia deliberately from ally to foe. Then in 1949 the Chinese communists drove the regime of Jiang Jieshi to the offshore island of Formosa (today Taiwan). Immediately Washington declared that this had been orchestrated in Moscow and was evidence of the international communist conspiracy to conquer the world. Now there were two Red Armies.
Well before entering the war itself, US military aid (including American pilots) to Jiang's corrupt regime against Japan, was a principal link in the chain of events leading up to Pearl Harbor. Jiang's Kuomintang army spent more time robbing their fellow Chinese, and living well off American funds, than engaging the Japanese invaders. The only genuine resistance to the Japanese in China came from the communists, a fact not lost on the Chinese masses. 
32
FDR had agreed at Yalta that the Soviets could retake Sakhalin, which the Japanese had annexed from Russia in 1905, and the Kurile Islands north of Japan, establish a naval base at Port Arthur and maintain rail links to the port of Dairen. The matter of Japan itself was left open. For his part Stalin renounced assistance to the Chinese communists and acknowledged Jiang's sovereignty over Manchuria. 
33
34
Having fought the Japanese to prevent them from controlling Chinese resources and markets, and closing the American Open Door, the Truman Administration now claimed that the Soviets were on the verge of succeeding where Japan had failed. In fact, Washington had little to fear from Moscow in the region. Having wrested the prize of China from the grasp of the Japanese the US was now about to lose China to the Chinese.
Despite what were clearly American betrayals of wartime agreements, Stalin did keep his promise not to aid the Chinese communists, actually supporting the Kuomintang, their bitter enemies. This was an effort to draw Jiang into the Soviet orbit and away from the Americans. Stalin also did withdraw his forces from most of Manchuria and north China in 1946, even though these regions bordered the Soviet Union and he had every reason to believe the US desired its own dominance in the region. Because Soviet worries focused on national security issues and not on the export of communist ideology, and Eastern Europe was central to those concerns, they were willing to back off in north-east Asia.
The Chinese communists, however, were not bound by any of this and moved against the regime they blamed for China's 14-year occupation by the Japanese, and for its very real exploitation of China's peasants. On 3 September 1945, one day after Japan formally surrendered, two divisions of US marines were landed along coastal China to occupy seaports, guard railways, secure coal mines and otherwise help to revive China's economy. Armed Japanese soldiers were ordered by the marines to assist them in these occupations.

There are aggressive forces in the world coming from the Soviet Union which are just as destructive as Hitler was, and I think are a greater menace than Hitler was.
Averell Harriman, Former Ambassador to the USSR; Senior Partner, Brown Bros. and Harriman Bank, 1948 (Powaski, 1991)   Korea does not really matter now. I had never heard of the bloody place until I was seventy-four. Its importance lies in the fact that it has led to the re-arming of America.
Winston Churchill, 1953 (Ford with Soyoung, 2007)   United States policy throughout the Cold War was framed in the name of containing communism and fostering democracy. Yet Washington overthrew legitimately elected governments, rigged elections, assassinated or abetted the murder of political fi gures and propped up criminal dictatorships that in moral terms were equivalent to anything to be found in the communist camp. The reasons are simple: the contest for global leadership was no morality play. George F. Kennan, the early architect of American Cold War strategy, put matters in the starkest terms:
We should cease to talk about vague…and unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.
American propaganda blamed the rebellion of Europe's colonies on communism too, though the real reason for global de-colonization was imperial tyranny in the fi rst place, and the collapse of European power after World War II. Communism served well as the bogey to be used to counteract any opposition to the goal of an American-led world order. By 1950 the US ruling elite had committed the nation's people and resources to confront these threats.
In 1950, as a response to the shocks of the Russian atomic bomb and the Chinese communist revolution, Washington chose to intervene in a civil war in Korea to prevent a takeover by native communists. From that moment on, the world over, the US and communists remained locked in mortal struggle, ensnaring many who wished to take neither side. Though the US never dared to attack Russia after it acquired the means to retaliate with nuclear weapons, the 'cold' confl ict took the form of many hot wars by proxy in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, East Timor, Afghanistan, Central America, the horn of Africa, Angola and Mozambique. Beyond these horrifi c wars, numerous other covert interventions, coups, assassinations and other crimes resulted in a death toll approaching the losses of World War II itself and the majority of casualties were civilians. These wars and forays sometimes were sanctioned by the United Nations but most constituted violations of the very international law to which the US and Soviets had pledged their support in order to avert the atrocity of war. None was declared by the Congress of the United States as prescribed by the US Constitution. And in every one the US public was whipsawed by lies and deceptions into initial support.
The Soviet A-bomb and the 'fall' of China sent shockwaves through the Truman Administration and intensifi ed the manufactured paranoia rippling through the politics of the nation. The most reactionary elements, soon to be known as 'McCarthyites' after Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, accused Truman of having 'lost' China and demanded more bellicose responses to communism. These extremists eventually claimed that American policies were actually steered by communists who had infi ltrated the administration and were undermining the foundations of the republic like red termites.
In short order the Truman Administration moved to the right and completely reorganized the executive branch of government, giving it powers even FDR had never assumed. The imperial presidency was permanently grafted on to the American system. The National Security Act of 1949 created the National Security Council (NSC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The NSC rapidly delegated to itself foreign policy prerogatives formerly the province of the State Department, while CIA's prime mandate from Congress was to analyze data to ferret out 'threats' and leave other US agencies to develop policies to meet them. The 'Company' as its members called it, soon engaged in illegal assassinations and coups against governments opposing US interests. Policies pursued by both the NSC and CIA would create security threats where none had previously existed. Before long these new agencies would act virtually as un-elected branches of government, believing the president worked for them, not the opposite. A new and shadowy 'secret government' was slowly entrenching itself.
On March 10, 1950 President Truman authorized a secret program to develop the hydrogen bomb, hoping to trump the Soviet A-bomb. Needless to say the Russians immediately responded with their own H-bomb project. With explosive energy thousands of times more powerful than the atomic bomb, this new weapon foreshadowed Armageddon.
In April the newly created NSC issued National Security Paper No. 68 (NSC-68), at that time the most far-reaching policy document in American history (it would be exceeded only by the manifesto of the neo-conservatives in 2000, 'Rebuilding America's Defenses'). This extraordinary top-secret document asserted that communism across the planet was a monolithic movement directed from Moscow and that American defenses had become 'dangerously inadequate', thus, major changes were required and failure would result in loss of strength to the USSR. The Reds were animated by a 'fanatical faith antithetical to our own' and desired to establish 'absolute authority over the rest of the world'. To meet this unprecedented threat, major fi nancial and economic sacrifi ces would be necessary, including tripling the defense budget to the detriment of social programs. The 'absence of order among nations was becoming intolerable'.

While the dangerous extravagance of NSC-68 provoked no debate within the new National Security State, Congress and the American people were another matter. Signifi cant numbers of law-makers and citizens believed their government was manufacturing hysteria and infecting the public with paranoia. The success of NSC-68's objectives could not be assured without major tax increases and gigantic new defense expenditures so opposition was silenced by the anti-communist witch hunts of the late 1940s and 50s that labeled all opposition as communist, or soft on communism. Even so in 1950 it appeared that efforts to raise taxes and enlarge the Pentagon would fail in Congress. As one anonymous aide to Acheson (perhaps Acheson himself) put it: 'We were really sweating it, and then, thank God, Korea came along!'

After 1945 the US intervened in Greece and Turkey, attempted a covert overthrow of the communist regime in Ukraine with rightwing Ukrainians who had collaborated with the Nazis, went to war in Korea and against China, overthrew the legitimate governments of Iran and Guatemala, aided attempts to assassinate the leaders of Egypt and Iraq, sent marines into Lebanon, attempted the overthrow of Castro in Cuba, initiated war with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, invaded the Dominican Republic, overthrew Lumumba in Congo and Sukarno in Indonesia, aided right-wing death squads in Guatemala and El Salvador, attempted the overthrow of the elected government of Nicaragua, aided Saddam Hussein to wage war with Iran and vice-versa, armed Islamic militants from across the Muslim world to wage jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan, invaded Panama, waged Operation Desert Storm to drive Iraq from Kuwait, bombed Serbia and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. And this litany barely scratches the surface.
What follows covers only the most major operations undertaken by the US government during the Cold War.
We are fi ghting in Korea so we won't have to fi ght in Wichita, or in Chicago, or in New Orleans, or in San Francisco Bay.
I would say that the entire, almost the entire Korean peninsula, is just a terrible mess. Everything is destroyed. There is nothing standing worthy of the name…there were no more targets in Korea.
General Emmett O'Donnell, U.S. Bomber Command, Far East
The War was fought without regard for the South Koreans, and their unfortunate country was regarded as an arena rather than a country to be liberated…the South Korean was regarded as a 'gook' like his cousins North.
The Korean War is the most forgotten and least understood confl ict fought by Americans in the twentieth century. It stemmed from the overriding goal of American policy to ensure that East Asia remained within the Open Door framework. Having fought Japan for primacy in the region the US, in the inevitable irony of history, had lost China to the Chinese. After that the US was loathe to allow any Asian nation to slip from the western orbit.
Korea was often called the 'hermit kingdom' with good reason since it was a small nation with a unique culture that was no threat to any of its neighbors. It became the victim of an immense calamity caused by great power rivalries. American pilots returning to their bases in the last year of war reported that there were no targets left to bomb in the north because vast tracts of Korean territory had been turned into a veritable wasteland. When an armistice was signed the nation was still split along exactly the same frontier as when the war began three years earlier, but Korea would never be the same again. It remains divided to this day. Both Koreas bristle with nuclear weapons and a large American force remains on standby. North Korea is probably the most militarized and regimented nation on earth because its rulers decided grimly and resolutely that they would never again allow a foreign nation to ravage it as the US did from 1950 to 1953.
Korea bordered Russia's traditional Far Eastern provinces in Siberia. One reason Russia had gone to war with Japan in 1904 was over Korea. The rivalry between Russia and Japan, and the penetration of East Asia by Britain and Germany, had led the US to issue the Open Door Notes (see Chapter 7), lest the entire area be closed to American enterprise. In 1909 Japan occupied Korea, exploited it as a colony, and remained until Japanese defeat after World War II in 1945. When the Soviet Army entered the war against Japan in May 1945 it easily swept the Japanese aside and quickly occupied northern China. It could easily have occupied all of Korea at the time but it had entered into an informal agreement at Yalta to occupy only the north and let the US to do the same in the south. Roosevelt had proposed a trusteeship for Korea and the Soviets were open to the idea but feared it was a tactic to incorporate the country as part of a permanent American presence in their own sphere of infl uence. So Korea's future remained an open question. The agreement between Stalin and FDR had come before the atomic bomb when US-Soviet relations were still somewhat amicable and while the US still believed Soviet assistance against Japan was militarily necessary. By 1948 the wartime alliance had morphed into bitter enmity. As the Cold War heated up, the Truman Administration tried to outmaneuver the Russians, pretending that there had been no Yalta agreement on Korea.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 inspired communist/nationalist movements throughout the colonized world. Just as communism thrived in China so it increasingly won popular support in Korea against Japanese occupiers. Throughout World War II the Korean communists led the primary resistance to the Japanese and were, even before the Red Army arrived in 1945, the most powerful political entity throughout the entire peninsula, and had a highly disciplined armed force. As a result, Korean communists believed they had won the right to a major role in an independent Korea.

Employing Korean soldiers and police who had helped the Japanese rule over their compatriots, Hodge ensured that civil war would become even more reactionary and vicious than it already was. Between 1946 and the outbreak of the Korean War at least 100,000 Koreans had already died as a result of this civil war. Even Hodge admitted that the South Korean government was essentially a fascist regime, much like Nazism.

It has long been an article of faith among anti-communist true believers that the Soviets instigated the sudden cross-border attack by communist forces from the north in June 1950 that started the Korean War. The Soviets did not instigate the war. The North Koreans, led by Kim Il-Sung, had been armed by the Soviets, but Syngman Rhee's regime had been armed by the US. In fact, the US was constantly trying to restrain the South Koreans from attacking the North. The war began at Kim's initiative.

Our defensive dispositions against Asiatic aggression used to be based on the West Coast of the American continent. The Pacifi c was looked upon as the avenue of possible enemy approach. Now the Pacifi c has become an Anglo-Saxon lake and our line of defense runs through the chain of islands fringing the coast of Asia. It starts from the Philippines and continues through the Ryukyu Archipelago, which includes its main bastion, Okinawa.
Then it bends back through Japan and the Aleutian Island chain to Alaska. 
12
Convinced that the attack was a conspiracy among the Soviets, Red China and North Korea, Washington moved troops quickly on to the Korean peninsula to reinforce South Koreans and Americans already there, lest the North Korean communists win in a rout. Truman declared Korea to be 'the Greece of Asia. If we are tough enough now, if we stand up to them like we did in Greece three years ago, they won't take any such steps.' 
13
The sudden attack in June 1950 caught the South Korean and US armies off guard and a rout followed. Taking advantage of the Soviet absence in the UN Security Council, the US used the UN to ratify the decision that Acheson and Truman had already made, though the president emphasized that the US desired only 'to restore peace… and the border'.

The dire military situation prompted MacArthur to say 'I see here a unique use for the atomic bomb.' Only two weeks into the war the Joint Chiefs of Staff considered whether A-bombs should be made available to the general.

The victory of China's communists had occurred only a year previously and their leaders viewed their hold on power as tenuous, given the implacable hostility of the US and its western allies. Thus, MacArthur's march to the Yalu River, China's border with Korea, was seen as an acute threat to the revolution. The head of the CIA, General Walter Bedell Smith, had warned that the Chinese would 'probably genuinely fear an invasion of Manchuria' itself and would establish a cordon sanitaire 'regardless of the increased risk of general war'.

The Soviet boundary was very close to Korea's and though they had not instigated the war, and were already at odds with communist China, they would not have accepted the defeat of China or an American army so close to their territory either. Having ignored intelligence warnings that China would aid the North Koreans MacArthur was badly outmaneuvered and US forces began to retreat largely in disorganized and chaotic fashion. Before long communist forces had regained the territory lost earlier. Acheson declared the rout the 'worst defeat of U.S. forces since Bull Run', saying later 'the defeat of U.S. forces in Korea in December [1950]  was an incalculable defeat to U.S. foreign policy'.

The Joint Chiefs sent word to MacArthur that China had the capacity to force his troops out of Korea but that he should take no measures that would lead to general war. 29 However, after driving South Korean and American forces across the border the Chinese People's Army stopped and pulled back to the 38th Parallel. Russian pilots were ordered not to venture south of that line. The communists were signaling a willingness to negotiate peace terms that would have restored the pre-war status quo. A golden opportunity existed to stop the killing and destruction but Truman decided at that point to prolong the war. At stake was the tripling of taxation to implement NSC-68 and thereby the entire policy of containment.

32
The war grinds to a stalemate Despite the tremendous loss of life and desolation, by the summer of 1951 the war had essentially ground to a stalemate. The Chinese were unwilling to provoke a wider war and MacArthur constantly reproved his commander-in-chief for his unwillingness to attack Chinese territory directly, leading Truman to relieve him of command. Though the general was greeted enthusiastically by massive crowds upon his return to the US, the public was actually growing weary of the war and Washington was beginning to realize that all out war with China would mean war with the Soviet Union, and any escalation would lead to World War III. Thus the 'limited' war in Korea could not be won. Now Truman reverted to the original UN mandate to restore the status quo.

In late 1952 Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected president largely on the strength of his promise that 'I shall go to Korea', which the public interpreted to mean he would end the war. Most historians now conclude that Eisenhower secretly sent word to the Chinese that he would use nuclear weapons. This dire threat led the Chinese to seek a nuclear guarantee from Stalin in return. Then almost miraculously Stalin died unexpectedly and a thawed political climate appeared rapidly in Moscow where new leaders pressured the North Koreans to come to terms. By April 1953 agreement was reached to release sick and wounded prisoners on all sides, but these talks soon broke down over whether communist prisoners would be forcibly returned. Many did not desire to return to China or utterly devastated North Korea. Communists captured by the South Korean Army were forcibly tattooed with anti-communist slogans under the eyes of Americans. Such marks would be seen as treasonous to either the North Korean or Chinese governments thus precluding the prisoners' return later.

We sure are pleased with those backroom boys at Dow. The original product wasn't so hot -if the gooks were quick they could scrape it off. So the boys started adding polystyrene -now it sticks like shit to a blanket…It'll even burn under water now…it'll keep on burning right down to the bone so they die anyway of phosphorous poisoning.
(Anonymous American pilot)
I call it the madman theory, Bob…I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that 'for God's sake you know Nixon is obsessed about communists'. We can't restrain him when he's angry -and he has his hand on the nuclear button -and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.
(President Richard Nixon)
If they want to make war for 20 years then we shall make war for 20 years. If they want to make peace then we shall make peace and then invite them to tea afterwards. (Ho Chi Minh, 1966)   No sooner had the US extricated itself from an enormously costly stalemate in Korea, with a loss of 54,000 American lives, than it stepped deliberately into another confl ict in Indochina. The Vietnamese forces, known as the Viet Minh and led by Ho Chi Minh, had just delivered France its most humiliating defeat ever.
The decisive victory of Vietnamese forces at Dien Bien Phu broke the French public's will to continue the French-Indochina war.
It had been one thing for the French to be soundly defeated by Germans in World War II, it was quite another to suffer a rout by colonial 'inferiors'. The sudden collapse of French rule in Indochina sent shock waves around the planet. If the Vietnamese could so effectively take advantage of France's diminished imperial power and free themselves, then so might the many other colonies of Europe and America throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The Viet Minh victory inspired other subject peoples and accelerated the de-colonization of all Europe's subjects. Just as they were meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, to validate the armistice in Korea, the great powers also agreed to formulate an end to the French-Indochina war. The Geneva Accords provided for the temporary division of Vietnam in order to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of French forces into the south and the forces of the Viet Minh into the north. After a two-year cooling-off period, elections would be held across all of Vietnam, French forces would leave and the newly independent nation would emerge under the government of its choice. Because the Central Intelligence Agency knew that the communist party of Ho Chi Minh would win these prescribed elections overwhelmingly, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles refused to sign the accords and the CIA immediately began to subvert them by sponsoring a handpicked candidate, Ngo Dinh Diem, for an election to be held only in the south of Vietnam in which only Diem ran, and by creating an armed force, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) to protect his regime. Thus Washington attempted to render the 'temporary' division of Vietnam into a permanent status. The independence of Vietnam under a government of its people's choice was thereby nullifi ed.
The result for Vietnam and all of Indochina was a tragedy of vast proportions. In the end the United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1975 after losing more than 58,000 lives. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia lost at least 4 million dead and innumerable wounded, orphaned and widowed. Toxic herbicides like Agent Orange were sprayed over an area the size of New Mexico and still contaminate Vietnam's water and soil. That nation now has the greatest proportion of birth defects in the world.
Most tragically, after years of continuing the war by embargo the US 'normalized' relations with its former enemy in 1995 on terms that could essentially have been achieved with no loss of life in 1954, had the American people not succumbed to the paranoid propaganda that all nationalists and professed communists were puppets of Moscow and, therefore, enemies of the US.
American involvement in Vietnam began during World War II when the forces of the Viet Minh allied with American soldiers under the command of the Offi ce of Strategic Services (OSS). The Viet Minh was organized by the Vietnamese communist party led by Ho Chi Minh in response to the Japanese takeover of Vietnam in 1941. Ho saw how easily the French had been toppled and believed that if the Japanese could also be defeated then Vietnam's independence would be at hand. When the US declared war on Japan, the Vietnamese liberation forces understood that their new enemy would undoubtedly be defeated by the US and let it be known that they stood ready to help by providing intelligence, aiding downed American fl yers and locating Japanese bases. By 1944 OSS forces were in the jungles of Vietnam alongside the Viet Minh.
On the very day that Japan formally surrendered to the US, September 2, 1945, Ho stood before a massive crowd in Hanoi and read the Vietnamese Declaration of Independence in words substantially borrowed from Thomas Jefferson. At his side stood American OSS offi cers. The American fl ag graced the stage and an American B-24 fl ew overhead in honor of the occasion. OSS offi cers wrote to their commanders that the Viet Minh were led by communists but were primarily nationalists, more interested in independence than anything else. The US they said could scarcely fi nd a better ally in south-east Asia than the Vietnamese and urged Washington to recognize their independence. 
41
42
The outcome of the 1946-1954 French-Indochina war ought to have served as a dire warning to Washington, but traditional attitudes that the US could always do what others could not prevailed. The war went badly for the French from the beginning. The Viet Minh forces swelled from about 2,000 in 1946 to over 350,000 by 1954, as well as hundreds of thousands of people organized into support groups to wage 'people's war'. 
43
By 1952 the US was paying for about 80 per cent of France's war and had built up a vested interest in its outcome. Thus, when the Geneva Accords provided for an independent communist-led Vietnam, Washington moved to undermine the provision for the temporary division of Vietnam and moved to make it permanent by leading the American public to believe that there were really two Vietnams: one democratic and in need of American defense, the other communist and intent on undermining its neighbor. To ratchet up the anxiety already produced by Cold War indoctrination the 'domino theory' was formulated, claiming that if Indochina fell then all of southern Asia would topple into the hands of communists. Revelations later showed that even the CIA did not believe this assertion but it served to frighten the public. 
44
The Geneva mandated elections were perverted when the US moved to make the division of Vietnam permanent by handpicking Ngo Dinh Diem to be president of South Vietnam and held rigged elections in which the only candidate claimed to win by 98 per cent of the vote. Diem had lived in Washington for years, was largely unknown to southern Vietnamese and was Catholic, unlike most Vietnamese. To provide the political base Diem did not possess, the CIA stirred rumors in the North of a coming persecution of Catholics by the communists. The agency then aided a boatlift of nearly 1 million northern Vietnamese Catholics to the south to settle around Saigon where they received privileged status and came into confl ict with local Buddhists.
In immediate response to the imposition of what they considered another foreign puppet regime, communist leaders urged popular rebellion. Viet Minh who had gone north when the Geneva Accords temporarily divided Vietnam, had by now returned to their ancestral southern villages en masse and established the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam (NLF) basing this in the pre-existing village organization that had undone the French.
One reason the Viet Minh had won popular support was the fact that they had expropriated landlords and redistributed land to peasants. The Diem regime confi scated these lands and gave them back to landlords who had largely sided with the French. Diem conscripted villagers into a new Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and attempted to repress the rebellion of the very people his government claimed to represent democratically. When villagers continued to aid the NLF he imprisoned them in 'strategic hamlets', guarded compounds where individuals were monitored closely. The NLF, whom Diem derisively called the 'Viet Cong', mounted a fi erce resistance despite the advantages the ARVN possessed in terms of advanced weapons and American special forces who trained them and accompanied them on operations. Diem, in turn, stepped up his repression, jailing all dissidents, most of whom were Buddhists, and was soon seen in Washington as a liability, since his rule could no longer be construed as democratic. In early October 1963, only weeks before his own assassination, President John F. Kennedy approved a coup by Diem's own generals in which Diem and his brother were murdered. They were shortly replaced by a series of military dictatorships, each of which Washington tried to portray as representing South Vietnamese democracy. In fact popular revolution led by the NLF intensifi ed against the perceived puppet regime. Despite every conceivable military advantage the ARVN enjoyed in weapons provided by the US the South Vietnamese government was about to fall to the people it falsely claimed to represent. To prevent this Washington employed a pretext to insert American armed forces.
No change in personnel could alter the fact that the government of South Vietnam was a creation of foreigners that was clearly designed to thwart Vietnamese independence and was opposed by the majority of the people it claimed to rule. Although President Lyndon Johnson and his advisers claimed the southern insurgency was orchestrated in Hanoi, all intelligence agencies agreed that it was overwhelmingly indigenous. 
45
On August 2, 1964 Johnson suddenly interrupted television broadcasting with a live speech to the American public charging North Vietnamese communists with an attack on a naval vessel, the USS Maddox, in international waters. Two days later he charged them with an attack on another ship, though both charges were false. 
46
But Johnson was lying. American naval vessels had long been assisting South Vietnamese ARVN and naval forces to attack northern coastal facilities and were thus violating North Vietnam's territorial waters under international law. The North Vietnamese were simply defending their territory and wanted to create an incident that would demonstrate that the US was covertly waging war against their regime. Most historians agree that LBJ did not want to get sucked into a war in Asian jungles but he was a captive of the anti-communist doctrine. Above all he did not wish to be the fi rst president to lose a war. 
47
Two US senators, Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest Gruening of Alaska, voted against the Tonkin Gulf Resolution arguing to the American people that their president was being dishonest, and warning that it would draw the US into a long-term quagmire and tragedy. Their patriotism was openly questioned. They were proven correct.
In March 1965 LBJ committed the fi rst ground combat troops from the Marine Corps, rapidly followed by the deployment of Army divisions. By 1968 over 550,000 troops were in Vietnam.
Prior to Tonkin, the communist regime in the north had provided minimal assistance to the southern based NLF, not wanting to engage the mightiest armed forces on the planet. Once the bombing of North Vietnam began, though, it was clear the US believed the key to its success would be the destruction of the northern communist regime. So hundreds of thousands of regular forces from the Peoples' Army of Vietnam (PAVN) began to infi ltrate into the south via Laos and Cambodia along what came to be called the 'Ho Chi Minh Trail'.
American fi repower devastates Vietnam but fails to root out resistance American fi repower was vastly superior to anything either the NLF or the PAVN could muster. Yet, though the US enjoyed a vastly numerically superior 'kill ratio' it could not root out or stem the resistance. So LBJ and his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, increased the ferocity of the air war. By 1967 the Joint Chiefs declared there were no more major targets left to destroy in the north. 
48
The US treated Vietnam as a laboratory for testing its growing arsenal of new weapons, demonstrating their terrifying lethality to potential enemies as well. 'The genius of American applied science fl ourished in the exploration of new ways to kill or infl ict injury.' 
49
50
Though the US eventually crushed the Tet Offensive, the US public had reached a psychological breaking point. Having been told for three years that there was 'light at the end of the tunnel' and that victory was near, facts on the ground proved otherwise. After the Tet Offensive a majority of Americans wished some kind of end to the war. When Secretary McNamara resigned in a state of nervous collapse his replacement, Clark Clifford, soon told LBJ that the war could not be won. With hundreds of thousands of protesters regularly outside the White House chanting 'Hey, hey, LBJ. How many kids did you kill today?' and growing congressional attention to his mendacious account of the attacks in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, Johnson suddenly withdrew his name for re-election. Though Republican candidate Richard Nixon immediately announced that he would end the war 'with honor', a new phase of confl ict was about to ensue.
The infamous massacre of 500 civilians at the South Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai occurred during the Tet Offensive, although it was not revealed until more than a year later. It had initially been reported as a great victory over the NLF. But a disaffected American GI wrote to Congress to reveal what had really happened and an investigation was launched. Even so the massacre was blamed on poor leadership in order to hide the greater atrocity of the war itself. Simultaneously, and for the fi rst time in American history, veterans emerged at anti-war rallies to recount many other horrifi c atrocities that were a daily part of the war. Indeed, many avowed that massacres such as took place at My Lai occurred every week, and implored their fellow citizens to stop the confl ict from which they had just returned. 
51
Having pledged to end the war Nixon widens it Nixon won the presidency largely on his pledges to end the war and to restore 'law and order' to the streets which were rife with anti-war and civil rights protests. Yet he retained the goal of an anti-communist South Vietnam. This could not be ensured without American fi repower. Nixon's quandary was how to make war and peace at the same time. He would withdraw American troops and the ARVN would take over the fi ghting. Since it was the very incapacity of the ARVN that had occasioned the US intervention in the fi rst place Nixon's 'Vietnamization' policy was inherently illogical, but it did reduce American casualties and diminished protest.
Only the continual application of American airpower could sustain such a strategy and Nixon reasoned that if the Ho Chi Minh Trail and communist sanctuaries in nearby Laos and Cambodia could be cut then the US might be able to dry up the fl ood of volunteers constantly infi ltrating into the south. In reality, secret bombing of both Laos and Cambodia had been ongoing for years, deliberately unreported in the US media. Nixon intensifi ed the onslaught. Then in May 1970 he shocked the nation by invading Cambodia. Instead of ending the war Nixon was widening it. This led immediately to massive street protests and student walkouts at one-third of American university campuses, and resulted in the infamous Kent State and Jackson State killings of students. (Kent State was a public university in Ohio where armed National Guardsmen fi red on demonstrating students, killing four. Ten days later at the allblack Jackson State College in Mississippi two students were killed by police, though this got much less attention than the killings of white, middle-class students.) In February 1971 ARVN units and some US forces moved into Laos but suffered a severe defeat and were forced to withdraw. By this time the war was spawning serious infl ation and the business classes were growing worried about the long term costs to the economy. As early as 1967 a 10 per cent surcharge on individual and corporate taxes had been levied to fi nance the war, leading to an immediate spike in opposition to the war. While the war initially stimulated the economy, most business executives not profi ting directly as arms purveyors saw the war as a net drain. 
52
Though formal peace discussions had been held between the US and communists in Paris since 1968 they had achieved nothing because American negotiators insisted that the North Vietnamese accept the division of their homeland, and recognize the government of South Vietnam, something absolutely unacceptable to them. When Nixon entered offi ce about 30,000 Americans had died. Four years later almost as many had perished on his watch. With his reelection in 1972 looming Nixon authorized secret meetings outside the Paris framework between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam. Anxious to take credit for a peace accord, Kissinger dropped the earlier demand for the removal of all PAVN troops from the south and offered a cease fi re in return for the release of American prisoners of war. The prime minister of South Vietnam, Nguyen Van Thieu, immediately accused the US of a sellout causing Kissinger to revise the offer he had made to the north. Le Duc Tho rejected these changes, so to punish North Vietnam one last time Nixon unleashed the most intense and destructive bombing of the entire war. Now known infamously as the 'Christmas Bombing', this air assault over Hanoi and Haiphong only weeks before the peace treaty was signed killed thousands of civilians and stained the already ignominious global reputation of the United States even more.
Vietnam had been one of the world's poorest countries even before the war. Afterwards the nation had to cope with approximately 3 million dead (there were another million and a half in Cambodia and Laos), millions of widows and orphans and about 10 million refugees, while epidemic disease coupled with the destruction of health care services was rampant. Exposure to toxic herbicides would soon bring huge numbers of cancers and birth defects. Even to this day the sheer numbers of unexploded bombs, and mines long hidden, continue to kill and maim. It is no exaggeration to say that Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are among the most war ravaged nations in history. 
53
54
For the 'victorious' Vietnamese the war was a catastrophe that impedes their nation's development to this day.
In the presidential campaign of 1980 Ronald Reagan sought to re-awaken Cold War animosities by claiming that the war in Vietnam had been a 'noble cause' betrayed by disloyal Americans. The movement against the war in Vietnam was by far the greatest in US history, mobilizing the largest street demonstrations ever and bringing great numbers of Vietnam veterans, as well as veterans of World War II and Korea into opposition. 'Nobility' was present in the millions of Americans who believed that the lies for which so many Americans and Indochinese had died were in fact perversions of the American creed.
Yet domestic political and economic factors and geo-political circumstances also contributed to ending the Vietnam War. Revelations in the 'Pentagon Papers', top-secret documents released by former defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg, showed clearly that fi ve consecutive administrations had lied about the war in order to maintain public support. 
55
In the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War the Cold War mentality cooled noticeably. The domino theory was abandoned. The imperial presidency came into disrepute. The confl ation of the anti-war movement with the parallel Civil Rights and Women's movements contributed to more social equality. Militarism was recognized and challenged. Attempts were made to rein in the CIA. The Draft was abandoned in favor of an 'all-volunteer army', though this did not solve the problem that most recruits still came from the bottom half of American society where there was less opportunity for higher education and work. Many Americans believed that the end of forced conscription would hinder new imperial wars from developing. But the nation's elite still championed an Americansponsored world order and scrambled to understand how best to accomplish this agenda in radically changed conditions. The military brass welcomed the transition because they had lost faith that a conscript army could be depended upon to win wars. An all-volunteer army made up of young men (and women) with few other options in the American economy could be highly professionalized, reliable and deadly, and would be employed readily after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
One enormous advantage among many that the US had in waging World War II was its own vast supply of petroleum. American oil fueled the colossal American juggernaut as well as that of many of its allies. By the late stages of the war, however, a critical reality surfaced. US supplies would no longer meet US requirements. If American global predominance was to be maintained, then new foreign sources of the precious substance would have to be located and brought under American protection. Allies would have to be found -or created -and bases constructed. Post-war reconstruction of Europe's economies as vital trading partners also factored into this strategy since the US would also have to guarantee their access to oil on terms effectively structured by Washington and the major oil companies.
The fi rst step came in 1943 when President Franklin Roosevelt left the Cairo Conference of the Allies to meet secretly with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. No record exists of the agreement the two worked out, but it clearly committed both nations to a symbiotic relationship in which the US would have access to Saudi oil and the Arab nation would be guaranteed American military guardianship. Thus did the US take the fi rst fateful steps toward its own dependence on the world's oil giant, becoming the defender of one of the most corrupt and brutal regimes in the Arab world.

Ironically, prior to World War II the US was viewed favorably in the region owing to its oft-declared opposition to colonialism. But Washington was busy re-inventing the rules of empire and it was not long before antipathy to the US became endemic throughout the region.
Winston Churchill once said that he had not become the king's fi rst minister to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire. But preside over it he did. In yet another of history's inevitable ironies England was victorious in World War II but because of suffering what famed economist John Maynard Keynes called a 'fi nancial Dunkirk' it eventually lost the very prizes it fought to keep. Reliant on the American Lend-Lease program during the war, England's dire economic straits left it even more dependent afterwards. In very short order Britain lost its 'jewel in the crown', India (and Pakistan), followed by Greece, Suez and Palestine.
Britain had taken over the former Turkish province of Palestine after World War I. Seeking aid against the Ottomans, the UK had promised independence to Arab allies, yet at the same time pledged in the Balfour Declaration that Jewish settlers in Palestine could have a state of their own. Both guarantees were mutually irreconcilable and in any case neither was kept.
Jews had begun migrating out of Europe to Palestine in the late nineteenth century in response to various persecutions. The leader of what would be termed the Zionist Movement, Theodore Herzl, believed that Jews would never be safe or accepted in any European country and therefore needed a state of their own. A return to Zion, or the ancient Jewish homeland, was their solution. 
57
58
Both Britain and the United States had thwarted Jewish escape routes from the Nazis and both nations refused mass immigration to their shores. At the end of the war many Americans felt a sense of guilt over their country's failure to do much to rescue Europe's Jews, especially after the terrible atrocities in the death camps were revealed. Only at the very end of the war did the Roosevelt Administration move to save about 200,000 eastern European Jews, a small number given the 6 million actually murdered. Even then the US allowed only a meager number to enter the US itself. 
59
60
In 1948 Jewish leaders declared Israel's independence and statehood. The neighboring Arab states immediately launched a war against the new state of Israel. Many Israelis had served in the British, Canadian and American armies against Hitler and had military skills. The new state had also imported arms from communist Czechoslovakia. Many Zionists were also socialists; some were communists and the Soviets were willing to support Israel to stifl e the US. Without much diffi culty Israeli forces defeated the Arabs, while at the same time deliberately cleansing Israel itself of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs, at times employing terror and atrocity, and extending the frontiers of Israel well beyond the lines prescribed by the UN. Over 800,000 Palestinians were now homeless and living in squalid refugee camps in nearby Arab nations.
The problem for the Truman Administration was whether to support the UN plan and then recognize the new state and, if it did, whether to demand that Israel return to the original boundaries and allow refugees the right of return to their villages. Administration offi cials were split. Truman himself was on record as supporting a Jewish state, but as violence fl ared before partition he suddenly opposed the plan, calling for a period of UN trusteeship instead, provoking many American Jews. Secretaries of State George Marshall and Dean Acheson feared that Arab anger would jeopardize the American access to oil. They also opposed allowing Jewish refugees in Europe to enter Palestine in mass numbers, while also opposing their settlement in the US. Public opinion still opposed the immigration of Europe's refugees, including those who had suffered most. One faction led by the president's legal counsel, Clark Clifford, recommended recognition for pragmatic reasons, including the necessity to win the Jewish vote in the election of 1948 in key states like New York. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and Navy Secretary James Forrestal viewed matters purely militarily, emphasizing the need to keep Israel oriented to the west and its armed forces cooperative in the defense of regional oil fi elds and Anglo-American airfi elds in Egypt and Turkey. 
61

Ultimately the claims of Jews to an ancient homeland and similar avowals from Arabs who had lived on the land for hundreds of years proved irreconcilable. Arab-Israeli confl ict undoubtedly would have been inevitable even if the original UN plan had been followed to the letter. After all, the UN vote to bifurcate Palestine was opposed by every Arab state, and Palestinian Arabs had no say at all. Seen from the Arab perspective Israel was a western implant designed to keep former colonial subjects in thrall. Individual Arab states also had their own designs on Palestinian territory. Israelis and Jews elsewhere believed that the new state was justifi ed by centuries of persecution that had culminated in the Shoah or Holocaust. One thing is certain, the creation of the state of Israel in the midst of what had been Arab and Muslim territory for more than a millennium has been a primary source of tension and confl ict throughout the Middle East and Muslim world in general.
In 1956 Israel joined Britain and France in a military effort to wrest control of the Suez Canal from Egypt, which had nationalized the waterway. Gamal Abdul Nasser had overthrown the corrupt, collaborationist monarchy and had called for Arab unity. At that stage the US hoped to win Egyptian and other Arab friendship as part of the larger strategy against communism. Consequently, exercising economic leverage, the Eisenhower Administration forced the British and French and Israelis to withdraw. The Suez Crisis ensured future enmity between Egypt and Israel. It also launched Nasser as the leading prophet of Pan-Arabism, a movement the US found as obstructive to its grand agenda in the Middle East as communism itself. In yet another of history's inevitable ironies, Nasser's policy of suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood only strengthened Islamic fundamentalism, so that as the US increasingly moved against Pan-Arabism it found Islamic extremists rising to take its place as the principal impediment to the American goals in the region.
The US fairly quickly decided to cement a military and intelligence relationship with Israel, ostensibly to keep the Soviets at bay. Yet, since a more realistic threat to the American post-World War II strategy stemmed from nationalism in the region and opposition from Arab regimes, Israel served as a base of military and covert intelligence operations. It was a 'strategic asset'. 
63
64
Israel and the United States are said to have a 'special relationship' but Israel is certainly the most bizarre ally the US has ever had. Israel has never hesitated to spy on its benefactor, in many cases using American military personnel to steal secrets. 
65
Numerous theories have emerged to explain why Israel would attack the only real ally it had. One conjecture holds that the Israeli government did not want the US to discover plans to attack and hold the Golan Heights in Syria, which it had promised Washington it would not do. This seems a thin justifi cation. Some speculate that the Israelis wished to cover-up a mass execution and secret burial of Egyptian prisoners in the Sinai desert, a clear transgression of the Geneva Convention. 
66
67
Seymour Hersh, the noted investigative journalist, has revealed that the Israeli nuclear program exists mainly as a last resort, its 'Samson option'. Just as the ancient Hebrew judge of the Old Testament killed all his Philistine enemies along with himself, Israel is prepared to destroy all its enemies should it believe that its very existence is endangered, and it has the means to do so.

Like Korea, Iran had been no threat to any of its neighbors but had been the victim of the 'Great Game' played out between Russian and British imperialism. Discovery of Iran's oil fi elds just as World War I broke out led Britain to take advantage of Russian weakness and intensify its control of Iranian politics via the Anglo-Iranian oil company (soon to be the British Petroleum Company).
By 1946, with British weakness evident, the entire Middle East began to gravitate toward what Washington considered the left. Certainly communist parties existed and played to Moscow but the real issue was burgeoning nationalism and the desire by peoples of the Middle East for independence and control over natural resources, of which oil was prime. In 1952 the Iranian parliament named the widely popular Mohammed Mossadegh as prime minister on the strength of his desire to nationalize Iranian oil and take it from British control. This both alarmed Washington and presented an opportunity. Decrying Mossadegh as a tool of the communists who would sell Iranian oil to the USSR and thereby strengthen Stalin's hand, the US moved the CIA into operation to overthrow the prime minister and restore Shah Reza Pahlavi, thereby co-opting Iranian nationalism, as well as the British, and 'starving' Stalin of oil at one fell swoop.
The operation was the first successful overthrow of a foreign government by the CIA and became the model for its future actions. Though claiming these measures as necessary to thwart the Soviets, the deeper goal, as part of the American grand strategy, was to acquire effective control over Iranian oil and build up military defenses and bases in the region. The ancient Persians gave us the word satrap. In order to make their widespread empire more effi cient, Persian kings ruled through local native chieftains. Now a modern Persian had become Washington's puppet and tool.
In short order Washington began to arm its satrap's military forces with some of the most modern weapons then being manufactured by American 'defense' industries. With oil now safely managed by American petroleum giants on a 60:40 ratio to their own great profi t, the Iranian treasury also had billions of dollars to inject into American defense corporations. The federal government abetted this process by selling surplus weapons to Iran, including jet aircraft, tanks, naval vessels etc. and then buying new ones from their defense contractors.
American military personnel were dispatched to Iran to train its armed forces. Simultaneously the CIA managed the training of Iran's secret police, known by its acronym SAVAK, which soon brutally crushed all opposition, engaging in widespread torture, murder and suppression of all dissidents, especially of Fundamentalists. For the next quarter century the Shah's Iran would serve Washington as loyal client and surrogate, ostensibly to stifl e Soviet expansion but equally to foil any form of nationalist opposition to the American overarching agenda.
As the Shah 'modernized' Iran he had to suppress the fundamentalist Shia Muslims, most of whom lived outside the metropolis of Tehran in conditions that had not changed in centuries. While the Iranian regime concentrated on raising the living standards of its elites and middle classes, many of whom were becoming progressively secularized, the conditions of the villagers outside the major cities were ignored, and, indeed, worsened. This left them susceptible to the infl uences of fundamentalist ayatollahs who inveighed constantly against the apostasy and immorality of Iranian rulers and city dwellers, blaming them for the poverty of the countryside. This circumstance, in turn, led the Shah to step up his increasingly brutal repression of the Shia, leading to many clashes between them and his armed forces. At one point, defying an edict that the traditional women's headdress, the chador, could no longer be worn in public, tens of thousands of women demonstrated in Tehran wearing the garment. The security forces opened fi re, killing dozens and wounding scores. From that moment on the Shah's days were numbered, though the CIA completely missed what was coming.
In 1979 the Shah was overthrown during a massive public strike and street violence, leading him to fl ee the country, ultimately going to the US. When radical students and Muslims demanded that Washington deport him back to Iran to face criminal charges President Carter refused. The result was the takeover of the American embassy in Tehran and the capture and imprisonment for 444 days of American personnel. During this takeover, Iranian militants discovered numerous documents stipulating the degree to which the US had collaborated with the Shah in the brutal suppression of the Iranian people and the overthrow of Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1953. The Iranian regime was taken over by religious fi gures who became more radically fundamentalist and stridently anti-American. Speaking directly to the deep anti-American resentments of other Muslims in the region, both Shia and Sunni, Iranian militants urged them to rise up against the 'Great Satan'. In short order this uprising materialized, creating panic in the neighboring Muslim nations of Iraq, Egypt and especially Saudi Arabia, where equally repressive and brutal regimes relied on US assistance to rule over their populations.
Washington responded with a punishing embargo of Iranian oil and the seizure of the nation's fi nancial assets in the US. However, these measures were fl atly contradicted by the actions the Reagan Administration took when war broke out between Iraq and Iran in 1980. Considerable circumstantial evidence has led numerous analysts to conclude that the Reagan election team made a secret deal with the Iranians not to release the American captives until after the election of 1980, thereby preventing the incumbent, Jimmy Carter, from achieving a major political victory and increasing the likelihood that Reagan would win. In return the Reagan presidency would provide arms to the Iranian regime. Since such traffi c with the Iranian enemy had been prohibited by Congress, any arms deliveries would have to be arranged covertly, and they were. At the same time Congress had also forbidden military aid to guerrillas in Nicaragua (known as Contras) attempting to overthrow a Marxist government there. To make the end runs around Congress, Reagan operatives secretly bought arms from communist Czechoslovakia, sold them to the Contras who paid for them by selling cocaine and then provided them to the Iranians who used them to kill Iraqis.

After the Spanish-American War (see Chapter 6) the US effectively ruled Cuba through a succession of client regimes that fostered American business penetration of the island especially in sugar, tobacco, banking and oil refi ning. By the 1950s the island was the poorest nation in the western hemisphere though its elites and wealthy Americans lived high and well in what for them was a tropical paradise. In addition to generous profi ts that American companies extracted, Cuba was also a major source of organized crime's illicit revenues in gambling, drugs and prostitution, all made possible by the ruling regime's cooperation. The most important opposition to that regime came from the movement led by Fidel Castro whose principal goal was to oust the Americans and those who collaborated with them.
Both Washington and the Mafi a provided some assistance to Castro early on, believing that any future regime would accommodate US wishes. Although Castro inveighed against the Americans his words were taken as the usual rhetoric of Latin American strongmen who eventually played Washington's game. American offi cials were wrong about Castro though. He immediately began kicking American corporations out of Cuba, expropriating their properties and driving Cubans who had collaborated with them out of the country.
Numerous American plans to invade Cuba to topple Fidel Castro's regime were formulated but never carried out, and covert plots to assassinate him all failed. Knowing the desire of Washington, business leaders and organized crime to overthrow him, Castro allied himself with the Soviet Union in order to forestall that outcome. In the process the US and USSR moved to the very precipice of nuclear war.
When Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 there was little worry in Washington. The previous dictator, Fulgencio Batista -who had originally been installed by Washington because the previous Cuban ruler had attempted to nullify the Platt Amendment (written into the Cuban constitution by the American Senator Orville Platt, enabling the US to intervene at will militarily in Cuban affairs, see chapter 6) -had become a liability owing to his brutal rule. American offi cials had every reason to think that Castro would accommodate himself to the US just as almost all caudillos (a Latin-American Spanish term for 'strongman' or 'chieftain') throughout Latin America, and especially in Cuba, had done since the turn of the century. Both the CIA and the Mafi a, collaborating closely, had extended some assistance to his revolutionary movement, believing he would enact reforms but otherwise accede to traditional American interests. 
70
Although the US had promised to liberate Cuba from the dire conditions fostered by Spain in 1898, the Cuban population had become the poorest in the western hemisphere, with the greatest rates of curable illnesses and highest rates of illiteracy, while the top 10 per cent or so lived in opulence. The Cuban elites largely collaborated with American dominance and received their perquisites in return. Indeed, Castro himself had come from a wealthy landowning family, but he was among the few who chafed under American neo-colonialism.
It wasn't long before American political and fi nancial elites realized that Castro fully intended to keep his promise to obtain full Cuban independence from the US. He expropriated the vast plantations owned by Cubans and made them over into agricultural collectives. He rounded up and jailed many members of the Cuban elite who had committed crimes against ordinary citizens and caused an exodus of the rich to Miami. Then he turned to seizing American sugar and tobacco plantations, closed American oil refi neries that had been located in Cuba to avoid American environmental regulations and expelled Mafi a gangsters who owned the gambling casinos, drug dens and brothels where desperately poor Cuban women sold themselves to wealthy Americans who fl ocked to Cuba to enjoy vices unavailable so easily, cheaply and at no legal risk in the US.
The Eisenhower Administration had initiated a series of covert operations against many different types of opponents to US interests on every continent, usually labeling them communist-inspired. One of the more sinister plots to emerge from the National Security State, though never implemented, clearly shows how American policy had become as criminal as anything to be accused of its enemies. Operation Northwoods was a plan urged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that would have sunk an American naval vessel in Cuban waters, or dressed anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Castro's army uniforms to carry out a staged attack on the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay. Such pretexts would then have served for full scale war against Cuba. Another aspect of the plan envisioned setting off terrorist bombs in Miami and then blaming Castro. 
71
72
The Soviets had already extended signifi cant military aid to Castro and their intelligence agency, the KGB, and Castro's, knew of the plan. Recent documents show that the CIA knew that the Cubans and Russians knew, but went ahead anyway, almost certainly to ensure the assault would fail so that a follow-up invasion by American forces would be necessary and the US could seize the island. 
73
The USSR had its own reasons for crossing the Atlantic to ally with an anti-American regime only miles from the US, in violation of the Monroe Doctrine and Teddy Roosevelt's corollary. The United States had by that time encircled the Soviet Union with bomber and missile bases rendering it extremely vulnerable to nuclear attack. Thus Castro's defi ance of the US provided the Soviets with an opportunity to give Americans a taste of their own medicine. This grew to gravely perilous proportions when Soviet nuclear missiles were installed in Cuba in 1962.
Kennedy understood that the missiles did not constitute any more of a physical threat than did the Soviet missiles in Kazakhstan, 15,000 miles away. Those ICBMs (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles) could also vaporize American cities. The threat was primarily political -domestically. The hard right-wing in the US saw the Soviet presence in the American lake as intolerable. The Soviets would back down if confronted, they insisted. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and many in the CIA demanded that JFK attack the missile bases in Cuba. 
74
Kennedy fi red the top echelon of the CIA, including its longtenured director, Allen Dulles, pushed the bellicose members of the Joint Chiefs into retirement, began arms reductions, initiated a 'hot line' direct communication with the Soviet premier and began to plan for a withdrawal from Vietnam, where some 15,000 'advisers' were already carrying out operations. 
75
76
Tragically, JFK and Robert Kennedy continued to plot the overthrow of Castro via assassination, though at the same time they also initiated secret talks with Cuban offi cials to effect a negotiated peace. As recently de-classifi ed documents show, the overthrow plan, code-named Operation Mongoose, was infi ltrated by Mafi a fi gures, with aid by rogue CIA agents, who used it to assassinate Kennedy himself, knowing that Robert Kennedy would never be able to divulge the original unlawful plot or prosecute the perpetrators without also revealing the level of corruption that had permeated the government. 
77
Yet the 'paranoid' strain in American political life remained intact. No sooner did the US fi nd itself atop the global hierarchy of power than many of the most hard-line Cold Warriors began to envision new threats, while others saw opportunities. Departing from the post-war consensus within the foreign policy establishment that had emphasized alliance building, a new thrust called for nothing less than a planetary order by American fi at. In 1992, just as the USSR collapsed, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz crafted a Defense Policy Guidance document that became the policy template for the radical manifesto of the neo-conservatives who came to dominate American foreign policy under George W. Bush. The so-called 'Bush Doctrine' called for actions that would ensure that the US retained its primacy as the lone superpower in order to structure and protect a global system that served American geo-strategic interests. In the absence of the communist counterweight and as the premiere global power, the US should be prepared to act unilaterally and preemptively to prevent any new power or combination of powers to emerge to challenge American hegemony. Since the maintenance of global dominance requires the indispensable fuel for the American economy and the armed forces that would carry out this grand strategy, 'In the Middle East and Southwest Asia, our overall objective is to remain the predominant outside power in the region and preserve U.S. and Western access to the region's oil.'

The collapse of Soviet power was hastened by its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Long a client state on the border of the USSR, Afghanistan had fallen into civil war between competing Marxist factions. The Soviets intervened in an attempt to stabilize the country but the incursion of 120,000 Red Army troops galvanized the pent up loathing of Afghanistan's tribal population which had long despised the secularization imposed by communist regimes. Meanwhile, in the US, policy-makers claimed the invasion was a Soviet fi rst move to dominate the Middle East oil fi elds and pipe lines. Some still lamented the recent defeat in Vietnam which they falsely blamed on the Soviets. President Jimmy Carter declared the so-called 'Carter Doctrine' which announced on January 23, 1980  that the US would protect Middle East states from communist attack, though the Soviets showed no evidence of harboring such aims. National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, put matters frankly. An opportunity had arisen, he said; 'We didn't push the Russians to intervene but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.' On the day the Red Army invaded Afghanistan he exulted, 'Now we can give the USSR its Vietnam War.'

The American-sponsored jihadists were called 'freedom fi ghters' but this was a classic Orwellian designation. These Islamists fostered terror throughout Soviet central Asia and succeeded in stirring up the Muslim populations in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to rebel against Soviet rule, all to the delight of offi cial Washington. Among these mujahideen was Osama Bin Laden. In Washington-speak when American sponsored terrorists kill and maim enemies, even civilians, they are 'striking a blow for freedom'. When the enemies do the same to Americans they are magically transformed into demons.
The Soviet misadventure in Afghanistan hastened a process of decay already in evidence, but which hastened the USSR's collapse and departure from the Cold War arena. No sooner had the most formidable foe the US ever faced disappeared than the very terrorists the US had sponsored turned their guns around to infl ict as much damage as possible on their former benefactor.
Just as the USSR was disassembling itself, the dictator of Iraq decided he would move against his neighbor and annex its territory, and oil. In his endeavor to seize Kuwait Saddam Hussein had reason to believe that the US would take no position and would refrain from interfering. The American ambassador to Baghdad had said as much herself. Whether this was a trap set for Saddam to provide a pretext for American troops to enter the Middle East in force is open to debate, but there is no question that the subsequent assault on Iraq and the stationing of numerous American troops on Saudi Arabian soil, in proximity to the sacred sites of Islam, set off a wave of anti-American hatred and jihad that has only grown stronger, particularly since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Had Saddam succeeded in annexing Kuwait, he would have challenged Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer and been in a position to defy the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and alter the international pricing system, perhaps to topple the dollar as the premiere oil-trading currency in favor of the new Euro. 
6
To stop Saddam Bush launched Operation Desert Storm in January 1991, sending half a million troops into the region and easily defeated Iraq in what can only be described as a 'turkey shoot'. The Iraqi army stood no chance against the high tech weapons and air power of the US. The Iraqi army, composed of ill-trained and poorly armed conscripts, was routed and slaughtered mercilessly. At that point it seemed likely that the US would invade Iraq itself and topple Saddam. But the consequences of such a move were too unpredictable. In the power vacuum left by Saddam's departure the potential that Iraq's majority Shia population could seize control and ally with their religious brethren in Iran was too threatening. Saddam was the devil the US knew very well. While US offi cials preferred Saddamism without Saddam, at least for the moment, his regime would ensure that Iraq did not succumb to Shi'ite fundamentalism and spread the poison into Saudi Arabia.
Most ominously, American air forces attacked Iraq's civilian infrastructure in blatant violation of international law, reducing a country that had been one of the most developed in the Middle East to an 'apocalyptic' condition.

According to the United Nations at least 1.7 million Iraqis died, not directly from bombs, but from the damage to civilian infrastructure that knocked out power to hospitals and, accompanied by draconian sanctions, prevented medicines and food from reaching the population, thereby worsening disease and hunger. In 1999 70 members of Congress wrote a letter to President Clinton asking him to lift the sanctions on Iraq and end what they termed 'infanticide masquerading as policy'. 
11
12
At the start of the Gulf War Bush asked the Saudi king to allow aircraft and troops to be based in the kingdom, claiming falsely that Saddam also intended to seize Saudi oilfi elds. At this point one of the most prominent jihadists recruited by the CIA for the holy war in Afghanistan came to the fore with an offer to defend the Islamic holy places of Mecca and Medina from the 'apostate' Saddam Hussein, instead of allowing foreign forces on Saudi soil. When the king did permit American troops to enter Saudi Arabia, Osama Bin Laden turned his considerable fortune -and his CIA sponsored training -toward overthrowing the corrupt Saudi royal family and conducting all out struggle against the westerners who had dominated the Muslim world for nearly a century. As Bin Laden publicly announced, this desecration of Islamic holy places was the fi nal outrage and made the US the number one enemy of fundamentalist Muslims everywhere. 
13
As the crisis in the Persian Gulf rolled out in 1990 and the Soviets completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan the US simply washed its hands of any responsibility for the ruin and chaos that had befallen that desolated nation. With their agricultural economy ravaged Afghan farmers quickly turned to cultivating opium poppies and Afghanistan became the world's greatest supplier of heroin. Afghan warlords rapidly fell out with each other, largely along ethnic lines and over the control of the lucrative drug trade. The CIA had been aware that one source of income for the mujahideen had been opium and the agency had turned a blind eye, thus playing a substantial role in the expansion of illicit drug traffi cking and a rise in addiction globally. 
14
On September 11, 2001 al Qaeda, in a classic case of what the CIA terms 'blowback', succeeded in the most destructive act of terrorism on US soil by bringing down the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and severely damaging the Pentagon, both of the targets striking symbols of American power. 
15
DEMONIZING IRAQ FOR THE EVENTS OF 9/11 TO FOSTER HYSTERIA AT HOME Though no evidence whatsoever indicated that Saddam Hussein had been involved in these attacks, both Vice President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld immediately called for action against Iraq.

19
Nevertheless, the Bush Administration exploited and fed the hysteria in the aftermath of 9/11, such that by October 2002, when the US Congress shamefully but predictably caved in to pressure and voted to give Bush authority to invade Iraq, about two-thirds of the American public had come to believe that Saddam had been complicit in the attacks and posed an immediate threat to the US itself. In March 2003, despite personal misgivings that the intelligence was faulty at best, Secretary of State Colin Powell went before the United Nations and asserted fl atly, with cartoonish and false 'evidence' that Saddam Hussein did possess biological, chemical weapons and was developing nuclear capacities. Powell also claimed that a 'high level' al Qaeda operative had informed the CIA that there was a close link between Saddam and the jihadists, although he knew that this 'information' had been obtained by intense torture, testimony that the victim later repudiated. 
20
An earthquake of the magnitude of 9/11 can shift the tectonic plates of international politics…the international system has been in fl ux since the collapse of Soviet power…this is a period not just of grave danger but of enormous opportunity…to create a new balance of power that favored freedom. 
21
Well before Bush took offi ce in January 2001, as a result of a Supreme Court decision and not the ballot, numerous former offi cials of his father's administration, now calling themselves The Project for a New American Century (PNAC), submitted a manifesto to the incoming president: 'Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces, and Resources for a New Century', an extension of the 1992 Defense Guidance Document written by Wolfowitz and signed by many of the very people who would soon be driving American foreign policy. 
22
It comes as a surprise to many that before World War II the US was the world's chief supplier of oil. Yet even before the war ended analysts knew that the future would bring growing dependence on foreign oil. That is the reason President Franklin Roosevelt cut his famous deal with the king of Saudi Arabia to provide American military protection to the kingdom in return for access to its vast reserves of oil. By 1945 the State Department had concluded that 'In Saudi Arabia, the oil resources constitute a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.' 
23
Former CIA analyst and NSC staff member, Kenneth Pollack, has noted that 'the global economy built over the last 50 years rests on a foundation of inexpensive, plentiful oil, and if that foundation were removed, the global economy would collapse'. 
24
25
26
27
One can already see the beginning of a larger contest. On one side are Russian and the Caspian countries, primarily Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and on the other side, the Middle East, including Iraq…the prize of this larger race to meet growing world demand is very tangible.

A principal aim of the US is to 'check' the Chinese and Russians. When the Taliban were overthrown in 2002 the US quickly made agreements with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan to station American aircraft in those nations. The Chinese interpreted these moves as sabotaging their initiative with the newly independent states of Central Asia. As one Chinese offi cial in Xinjiang, the far western province bordering Central Asia, said:
Our situation has much deteriorated recently. The Americans are driving us out of the region…the US troops are here in order to control the oil reserves in Central Asia…the United States has bases in Japan, the Philippines, in South Korea and Taiwan, and now here -China is going to be encircled. 
32
33
34
So such a pipeline is still a possibility, though the overriding goal of US policy is to foster a regime in Afghanistan that will stifl e the Taliban and the growing surge of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the entire region. The inherent contradiction in such a policy is clear: the deployment of more and more American and NATO forces in Muslim nations fosters the very threat to stability the US wishes to achieve.
By limiting China's access to oil the US also seeks to prevent it from becoming the superpower it is on track to become. However, with fi ve times as many people to employ, feed and house as the US, any stifl ing of China by American unilateral actions is bound to produce confl ict. Given that there is simply not enough oil to go around that would allow development in China, India and other nations comparable to that of the US, the logical option would be international cooperation in the creation of and investment in alternative forms of energy, rather than the kind of international competition that has brought on two terribly destructive global wars in the last century. In the current context of global economic meltdown the contest for supremacy in Eurasia, the new and deadly 'Great Game' is heating dangerously.
By supporting the Turkish route for a Caspian pipeline the US is also stepping up tension with Russia. As the second largest producer of crude oil and Europe's single source of natural gas, Russia has its own interests at stake. National security remains its highest priority. Although the US promised Russia it would not use NATO to threaten its security after the breakdown of the Soviet system, Washington has enabled former Soviet republics like the Baltic States, Poland and the Czech Republic to join the Atlantic alliance, thereby putting western arms virtually on Russia's border. Russian offi cials see this as an American encirclement tighter than the one during the communist era. The US has also announced a plan to station a 'missile defense system' in Poland and the Czech Republic, aimed at 'protecting' Europe from a claimed threat from Iran. Russians see this as a ploy to weaken their own defenses, since the so-called menace from Iran is not credible. Simultaneously Washington has cultivated close military ties with the former Soviet republic of Georgia in order to use Georgian territory for the planned oil pipeline to Turkey. The Russians claim (with considerable evidence

Though the Russians and Chinese have long had their own mutual disputes, they both have moved closer to each other to counter the increasingly aggressive moves by the US quite literally in their own backyards. As global recession deepens into depression many conditions similar to those that spawned World War II are making an ominous re-appearance.
Every American schoolchild is taught that the United States represents principles and values that are the only hope of a rational, orderly, just and peaceful society. As such the American political and moral code is supposed to be an advance over the atavistic regimes of the past and the 'rogue states' of the present, and the model for others to emulate. These values are among the most important ever articulated by humans. Although the American commitment to these principles has been honored as much in the breach of them as their fulfi llment, youngsters rarely learn why or how. By and large the nation's students imbibe what the American historian James W. Loewen calls the 'Disney version' of the nation's past which propagates a collective hallucination that the US is the primary source of human progress.

None of this is to suggest that vaunted American values are inconsequential. They can only be realized by the deliberate and courageous will to stand up for them, and we must not allow ourselves the luxury of self-deception that they are already attained. The United States is not Nazi Germany, though racism and militarism remain embedded in the culture. It is not a totalitarian dictatorship, though there are many who would foster a command society if they could. The 'American creed' did not emerge full blown from the head of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson but from the constant struggles of those Americans who took the language of the Declaration of Independence at face value and demanded that the Bill of Rights apply to them. This conviction explains the limited extent to which the United States has achieved, at least for the middle classes, the semblance of a humane and comfortable society, though the actual workings of the economy are steadily eroding that.
Visitors to the nation's capital in Washington, DC cannot fail to see the Capitol District's physical resemblance to ancient Rome at the height of its glory (the slums of the city also parallel those of Rome). Those who imagined the capital at the time of its planning envisioned the Roman Republic as their model but the architecture is that of imperial Rome. Perhaps, unconsciously, planners understood what Benjamin Franklin had warned about -that republics up to his time had always degenerated into empire or dictatorship.
The Roman style temple that is the public face of the National Archives on the Washington mall houses the nation's founding documents: original copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. One enters through gilded portals to a chamber consciously designed to evoke a semi-sacral atmosphere. Along the walls are murals depicting the Founders engaged in the formative acts that gave birth to the nation. Both the Constitution and Declaration hold center stage and are housed in glass tabernacles atop what can only be called altars. Inside are the sacred texts which, in order to get close enough to read, a pilgrim must kneel. All of this was carefully designed to foster what amounts to a quasi-religious experience to drive home the sanctity of the founding of the republic.
It is fi tting that we regard the documents and the sanctuary that enshrines them as symbols of indispensable principles. But at bottom the texts remain mere scraps of paper in the absence of a genuine commitment to the values they assert as the birthright of all peoples, not only Americans.
If millions of fellow Americans are still ill-housed or ill-fed, if lies are the medium by which presidents manipulate the citizenry into war against peoples who have done us no harm and our policies rain death, desolation and despair upon innocents in foreign lands, to what degree can we really claim adherence to the creed we profess?
The prosperity and freedoms of favored American citizens has always required that others be deprived, and has always been premised on exploitation in the forms of land grabs, slavery, low wages, the repression of labor rights, currency and interest rate manipulations and direct corporate and military involvement in other nations. Resistance to these measures, at home or overseas, has always been met with violence or war.
Americans delude themselves when they insist that we are a peace-loving people who will go to any extreme to avoid violence. War is the American way of life. The American project began in violence, the nation was born amidst blood and the growth of the American republic is matched by a corresponding chain of carnage from the Pequot Massacre to Wounded Knee to My Lai and to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; all alleged to be the fault of others. When the events of 9/11 killed 3,000 people the nation was profoundly traumatized, primarily because Americans could not understand how such outrages could happen to them. Yet the American people, through their government's policies, have been visiting horror throughout the world since the US attained the pinnacle of the global power hierarchy in 1945. These are facts well remembered where they took place, yet all but unknown, or forgotten, in America.
Few voices are raised in condemnation of the suffering we have brought literally to millions. At every turn the bloodbaths were carried out in the name of 'freedom and democracy' over the forces of darkness, led by the only people capable of defending such principles. Yet, ulterior motives lay behind every American war, primarily to enhance the license and material plenty of some Americans, never all, at the expense of those whose land, resources, self-determination or very lives were taken, including the Americans who constituted the armed forces. Thus we delude ourselves that ravaging countries like Vietnam or Iraq is really delivering them from evil; that inscribing the names of tens of thousands upon our own cenotaphs makes the sacrifi ce holy and acceptable.
Although the United States participated in the creation of international law, now, under the pose of a war on terror, it has fl outed the very norms it previously endorsed, all but formally repudiating the Geneva Convention. Should it surprise us that the lawlessness of the American invasion of Iraq, support for corrupt princes, sheiks and emirs, secret torture bases and many other direct or covert interventions in the Muslim world, fi nd their rejoinder in the lawless violence of Islamic extremism? Having fomented Islamic terror by its own coups, assassinations, military forays and support for Israel's continued settlement of land that is supposed to belong to the nation of Palestine, the US government still pretends, in keeping with hallowed ritual, that America is an innocent victim beset by a new set of evildoers. The refrain is always the same: offi cial rhetoric intones that only more armed violence can resolve the problem.
American culture, as the heir of imperial Europe, pretends to a moral superiority but the truth stands naked in the neo-colonies, and as the American economy unravels after decades of being managed as a gargantuan Ponzi 2 scheme, and our collective self-deceptions come undone, we arrive at a critical crossroads.
As this volume reaches its editors the American people have elected a new president whose central campaign guarantee is 'change'. He had been the only presidential hopeful roundly to condemn the march to war in Iraq and he promised that, if elected, he would end it. Declaring, however, that the Iraq War had diverted resources and attention from the real danger, terrorism, he also said that he would increase forces in Afghanistan, thereby ominously foreshadowing an intensifi cation of that confl ict. The vast majority of Americans who voted for him did so on the strength of his anti-war credentials. Just as all his predecessors have pledged, Barack Obama vows to sweep 'insiders' from their perches and sinecures and appoint as his advisers those whose commitment is to a fundamental national reorientation and renewal of the American promise. As his inaugural address declared, 'Those who see war must imagine peace.' Yet Obama's retention of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense, his appointment of a prominent lobbyist for a major military contractor as Gates' deputy and his selections of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and of retired General James Jones as National Security Adviser is disconcerting at best. In fact all of his major cabinet appointments are pillars of the Washington establishment.
His defenders would undoubtedly argue that Obama must make such appointments or risk the ire of his political opposition, and then see his initiatives grind to a halt. This is the all-too-familiar refrain after every American election.
Gates is a career CIA insider who subsequently became head of CIA himself. Another well-respected career CIA analyst who has condemned both the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan has called Gates a 'panderer' for his proclivity to tell his superiors what they want to hear, or to keep their secrets.

Gates must also be counted among the bellicose faithful who believe that the US rightfully employs armed violence against the weak. He has never urged that major powers should be the target of American military strikes, only those who cannot fi ght back. He condemned the 'half-measures' that he said had led to defeat in Vietnam, although the US dropped about 12 million tons of bombs on that beleaguered nation; and he advocated that the US bomb the tiny nation of Nicaragua in the 1980s to dislodge the Sandinistas, as the Nicaraguan government was known, despite the fact that it had won fair election as the choice of a large majority of Nicaraguans. When he was named to replace Donald Rumsfeld as Defense Secretary in 2005 Gates immediately asserted that the increase of 30,000 troops in Iraq had effectively turned the tide in favor of the United States and advocated a similar 'surge' of troops for Afghanistan. Writing recently in the house organ of the American Foreign Policy Establishment, Gates avows that 'the United States needs a military whose ability to kick down the door is matched by its ability to clean up the mess and even rebuild the house afterward'.

Gates is also among the hawks who fear the emergence of China and who call for a major buildup of high-tech weapons systems to meet any potential attempt by the Chinese to thwart American goals in Asia. As the most populous nation on earth, China has its own regional aims, but these too often come into confl ict with the longstanding aims of US policy in East Asia. The national security priesthood's ritual incantations about an omnipresent threat from China enforces a collective amnesia. The American public too easily forgets that China has experienced American armed violence before, on its territory and on its very doorstep. It never seems to occur to us that China wishes to protect itself from a perceived threat emanating from ourselves. The following is how Gates perceives China's emergence:
In the case of China, Beijing's investments in cyber-warfare, antisatellite warfare, antiaircraft and anti-ship weaponry, submarines, and ballistic missiles could threaten the United States' primary means to project its power and help its allies in the Pacifi c: bases, air and sea assets, and the networks that support them. This will put a premium on the United States' ability to strike from over the horizon and employ missile defenses and will require shifts from short-range to longer-range systems, such as the next-generation bomber.

The images of Russian tanks rolling into Georgia last August were a reminder that nation-states and their militaries do still matter. Both Russia and China have increased their defense spending and modernization programs to include air defense and fi ghter capabilities that in some cases approach the United States' own.

Gates' long history as water carrier for covert and violent interventions in the affairs of other nations makes him a curious candidate to wage the peace President Obama says he desires.
Though he declared in his campaign that lobbyists would be banned from his administration, Obama has also nominated William Lynn as Gates' deputy, a lobbyist for the Raytheon Corporation, a major military contractor receiving billions of dollars from the US Treasury for the Patriot missile system, the Navy's Tomahawk Missile and an Air Force global positioning satellite. Ever since World War I, when the military-industrial complex President Eisenhower warned against in 1961 really came into existence, it has developed a vested interest in a permanent state of tension and preparation for war. As our history demonstrates unambiguously, when the US prepares for war it usually goes to war.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's vote in October 2002 to grant Bush the war-making powers he subsequently exercised to invade Iraq is well known. She claimed during her failed presidential campaign that she was misled, as did John Kerry before her in 2004. Both of these senators were well placed to know that the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had close ties to al Qaeda were patently false. Yet because both were political opportunists unwilling to make a stand against the growing hysteria induced by Bush's lies, because that might have derailed their ambitions, they helped to enable the crimes that ensued. Clinton also made it clear during the 2008 campaign that she would have no moral qualms about nuking Iran.
The title 'National Security Adviser' implies responsibilities centered on the protection of the United States from threats to that security but from the time the position was created in 1949 as the US embarked on the Cold War it has been a key player in the numerous interventions and wars that have deliberately been pursued. The National Security State requires enemies and it functions to create them and then exploits that manufactured state of affairs to promote further actions in the name of national security. Any criticism that Obama may face that he is soft or naive will be blunted with retired four-star General James Jones at his side.

Member states of the alliance initially provided assistance after 9/11 but the interests of the new European Union are coming into confl ict with the American priorities for NATO, so they are now re-thinking their policies. National Security Adviser General James Jones served as the Supreme Allied Commander of the NATO coalition from 2003 to 2006 and knows all the people who need to be re-persuaded that it is in their interest to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda, and hence a source of jihadists to dwell among the large Muslim populations of the European Union.
If a resurgent and strengthened NATO is to emerge during the Obama Administration then this will alienate Russia even more and cause her to do what it did when fi rst confronted by this alliance. It will intensify its own arms buildup, improve its nuclear arsenal and the world will be back at fi ve minutes to midnight.
As a career military offi cer Jones has always followed orders. His advice to General Peter Pace when he assumed the post of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was 'You're going to face a debacle and be part of the debacle in Iraq.' Reputedly, Jones was 'so worried about Iraq and the way Rumsfeld ran things that he wondered if he himself should not resign in protest'.

The continued military attacks against Islamic peoples, and the threats to engage in others in Pakistan and Iran, which as Obama has said remain 'on the table', do as much for Taliban and al Qaeda recruitment as any preachments in their religious schools or madrassas. The so-called progressive wing of the establishment is on exactly the same page as the neo-conservatives when it comes to dealing with the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism and the intent of its most extreme devotees to wage jihad upon the US and the west: war to the death. No one in power is willing to contemplate honestly why this contest has emerged in the fi rst place, and thereby to remove that cause. Muslims lived side by side with the godless communists for 60 years without jihad. It was not until the Soviets invaded Afghanistan that Islamists coalesced in militant opposition to the communists, with the full encouragement of the US. They turned their guns around against their American sponsors after the Soviet withdrawal only because the US deployed troops on the soil held most sacred to Muslims. Yet, even despite the American support for the Shah in Iran, attempted assassinations of Nasser in Egypt, intervention in Lebanon in 1958 and 1983, support for the corrupt regimes in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the all but formal alliance with Israel, it took that fateful foray into Saudi Arabia to mobilize the Islamists against the US. George W. Bush threw down the gauntlet when he employed the term 'crusade' to call Americans to war after 9/11.
Terrorism is not an existential threat to the United States though another global war will be and the continued US armed intervention in the Muslim world shows every indication of promoting just that.
As this book goes to press President Barack Obama has stated that American combat forces will be withdrawn from Iraq by August 2011. Yet, the military has also made it clear that at least 50,000 other troops, not classifi ed as 'combat' will remain. This fi gure does not include the enormous number of civilian contractors, probably around 100,000 in both Iraq and Afghanistan, who will also serve the empire's needs. Many of these can only be described as paramilitary mercenaries. Obama has also ordered a substantial increase of American forces in Afghanistan, appointed a specialist in counterinsurgency to direct the escalation of the war there and stepped up the employment of predator aircraft, or pilotless drones to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda. While the US military claims that these efforts are weakening the jihadists, the intensifi ed warfare is also killing many more civilians, thereby undermining any claim that the US is winning the hearts and minds of ordinary Afghanis. Indeed, just as American actions in Vietnam did much for Vietcong recruitment, so American war efforts have driven the Taliban into neighboring Pakistan, where consequences similar to the civilian casualties in Afghanistan, are fostering jihadist recruits in that country as well. Thus, what can only be characterized as President Obama's war is inexorably being widened and deepened. Many observers warn that the new president is falling into a trap similar to the one in Vietnam that undid President Lyndon Johnson's presidency.
Obama seems to believe he can do what every other nation attempting a similar goal has failed ignominiously to accomplish in that part of the world. He cannot be oblivious to the parallel dangers his policies may incur with respect to Russia and China, or how Pakistan's devolution into chaos may affect its already tense relations with nuclear armed India, yet he is wading into the slough full speed ahead. Meanwhile, America's albatross-like ally, Israel, has elected an extreme right-wing government that is obsessed with Iran's nuclear program and threatens constantly to destroy its nuclear facilities. Should such an attack come to pass, cataclysmic violence throughout the entire region will be the result, and at the very least will cause the utter collapse of the global economy, dependent as it is on access to Gulf oil. That in turn would foster conditions worse than those that generated World War II.
In San Francisco's Union Square a towering triumphal column celebrates Admiral George Dewey's victory over the obsolete and dilapidated Spanish fl eet at Manila on May 1, 1898. It would not have been out of place in the Rome of the Emperor Trajan.
52. General George Marshall estimated that the Japanese would meet any American invasion of the southern island of Kyushu with more than 300,000 troops and the Japanese were duly building up forces to meet such an eventuality. The opportunity existed to kill hundreds of thousands of soldiers, not civilians, but this option was not taken.
