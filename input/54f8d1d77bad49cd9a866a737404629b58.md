Because its aspirations are similar to those of Russia and China, Iran serves as another example of a state holistically adopting war as a continued process.
Iran's use of proxies such as Lebanese Hezbollah and arguably Hamas and the Houthi brings that state the closest to traditional war against western interests, but still leaves it operating in the gray zone.
Lebanese Hezbollah and Israel remain engaged since Hezbollah's creation in the early 1980s.
That terrorist organization attacks western allies, predominantly Israel and US forces as seen in the U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut in 1983 and again in the June 25 th 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.
