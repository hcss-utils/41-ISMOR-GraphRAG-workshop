NATO has started to adapt to the hybrid challenges-particularly in reaction to Russia's hybrid war in Ukraine-by rapidly developing a comprehensive strategy against hybrid threats.
However, NATO is still far from implementing such a strategy.
To develop an effective, comprehensive plan, NATO needs to balance its forces, as well as further develop its instruments, resources, and approaches.
NATO forces need to be highly flexible and adaptive, and NATO NRF and VJTF need to encompass every dimension of a counter-hybrid force.
