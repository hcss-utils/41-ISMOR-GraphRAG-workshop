The primary methodology of this thesis will center on case studies of military presence of the Soviet Union/Russia and the United States in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan.
Special emphasis will be placed on Karshi-Khanabad (K2) Air Base, Manas Air Base and Bagram Air Base respectively.
The case studies will zero in on the countries' past relationship with the former Soviet Union (and current Russian government) and indicators that might predict success or failure.
Was the base presence a result of cooperation or occupation?
How critical are bases in Central Asia to Russia?
