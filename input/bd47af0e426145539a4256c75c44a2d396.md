First, the targeting of the bulk of the assistance to Russia, and the neglect of the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, could, in retrospect, be seen as a mistake.
Such a policy did not significantly contribute to the strengthening of independence of the rest of the former Soviet republics, vis-a-vis the possible resurgence of the Russian imperialistic intentions; second, reliance on personalities, rather than basic principles, in US dealings with Russia tied the future of American interests to the political viability of certain Russian politicians.
In connection with this last point, it is obvious that the administration was caught off-guard by the results of Russia's November 1996 elections.
In a series of contradictory and confusing statements, Clinton administration officials characterized the results -especially Zhirinovsky's ascendancy -as an inconsequential protest vote, an indication that the US was not on the right course.
Another indication was the Russian military operations in the Caucasian republic of Chechnya ordered by President Yeltsin, whom the West and the US considered to be the main guarantor of democracy in Russia.
