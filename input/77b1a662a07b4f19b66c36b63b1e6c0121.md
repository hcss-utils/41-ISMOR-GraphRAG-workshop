North Korean hybrid warfare is the central concept of its war strategy to achieve the goal of reunifying the Korean Peninsula with its socialist ideology.
With lessons from Hezbollah's and Russia's successful hybrid warfare in 2006 and 2014, it is more than likely that North Korea will fully utilize hybrid warfare in a future conflict, considering its ties with both actors, evolving capabilities, and hostile intention.
Without a doubt, South Korea may be the biggest victim of those threats; however, the threats are also crucial for other Asian countries and countries worldwide, because hybrid warfare on the Korean Peninsula affects the regional stability and possible cases of future hybrid warfare elsewhere.
If North Korea executes another successful hybrid warfare, more hostile countries or entities will seek to employ similar warfare against neighboring countries.
