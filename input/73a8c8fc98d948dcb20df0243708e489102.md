Russia's successful continuation of the active measures strategy under Vladimir Putin can be given more validity with a brief understanding of the Soviet Union's history of mistrust with the United States and Russia's employment of active measures.
To further explain the life cycle of Russia and in order to provide context into Russia's current strategy and national power interests, this paper will examine Russia's history with special interest in how that history intersects with the United States' and Russian interests.
