The overarching purpose of this section was to describe and interpret the foreign policy goals and irregular methods China and Russia currently use in synchronized fashion to weaken and undermine the U.S.-led international world order through nonmilitary ways in order to restore status and influence for these once great powers.
It is far from exhaustive, but rather serves to provide a small sampling of actions and intentions.
As the next section will show, these states' use of irregular tactics to further upend the status quo is continued in neurowarfare.
