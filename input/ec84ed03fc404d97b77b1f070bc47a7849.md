Hambling, like Scharre, suggests that the US military should develop a doctrine for the employment of swarm UAVs in order to sustain its technological and military advantage over other technology-seeking states such as China and Russia.
Hambling suggests that military leaders do not have enough trust on the reliability and effectiveness of swarm robotics to develop a doctrine for unmanned warfare.
Hambling states that swarming UAVs have the potential to change the battlefield geometry and the conduct of war; therefore, the US military should seek to employ this technology as soon as possible.
