To achieve U.S. interests, the U.S. military will need to provide forces that can compete with Russia across a range of different types of interactions, from cooperation to conflict.
Given Russia's extensive conventional and nuclear strategic deterrent capabilities, the key challenge will be how to develop U.S. capabilities that can achieve U.S. interests at any intensity of competition without escalation.
The United States will also need to consider how to minimize cost, given the limited risk of Russian actions threatening U.S. core interests and competing budgetary priorities.
Using the framework of our identified Russian strategy for the armed forces, we describe the policy implications for the United States of our analysis of Russia's future interests, capabilities, and priorities, with a focus on the U.S. Army.
