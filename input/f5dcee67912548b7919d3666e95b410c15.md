Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, must be evaluated.
Gerasimov's thoughts, known as the "Gerasimov Doctrine," form the intellectual foundation of Russia's approach to hybrid warfare.
The Gerasimov Doctrine describes the evolving character of war in relation to evolving technology, international policy, strategy, and international relations.
Furthermore, it reflects Russian experience, education, and adaptation following the post-Soviet conflicts with Transnistria, Chechnya, and Georgia.
