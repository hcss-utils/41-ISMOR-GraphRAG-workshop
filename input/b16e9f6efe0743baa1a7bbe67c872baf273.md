To draw the policy implications for the United States, we analyzed different ways in which Russia's interests, preparations, and capabilities may in the future interact with U.S. interests, priorities, and capabilities.
To achieve U.S. interests, the U.S. military will need to provide forces that can compete with Russia across a range of different types of interactions, from cooperation to conflict.
As the 2018 National Defense Strategy articulates, the U.S. military will likely be called on to counter coercion and subversion short of military competition, strengthen allies and partners, deter adversary aggression, and if necessary, defeat aggression by a major power and manage escalation up to and including nuclear war.
