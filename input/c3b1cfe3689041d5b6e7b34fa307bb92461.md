Moscow siding with Tehran and playing a critical role in preserving the regime in Damascus (which the majority of the international community deemed unsalvageable and undesirable) may have served to restore and possibly enhance perceived Iranian power and status, although Iran continues to be seen in the region and beyond as a nefarious actor whose support facilitated continued mass atrocities by the Assad regime.
Iran's intervention forced the West to negotiate with it on the future of Syria.
In early diplomatic processes (Geneva I, for instance), Iran was excluded.
Later, Iran was invited (e.g., in the International Syria Support Group and the Vienna process).
This was in grudging recognition by the West, including the Obama administration, that Iran was critical to the future of Syria.
Second, Iran, Russia, and Turkey led the Astana process, also a product of the influence Iran achieved through its military intervention.
Nevertheless, any gains in prestige were a byproduct of the war and not a result Iran knew it could expect from its involvement in Syria.
