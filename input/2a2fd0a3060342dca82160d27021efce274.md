First, irregular warfare can shape the competitive space by disrupting the efforts of America's adversaries through the intentional generation of difficult problems for its competitors in areas where they have signaled national interest or commitment.
These efforts could range from supporting resistance activities, as illustrated by U.S. support to the mujahedin in Afghanistan in the 1980s, to information operations, influence operations, or cyber operations designed to foment an untenable public sentiment in a particular country.
A potential modern application can be found in Syria, where Russia and Iran have both invested heavily, signaling their interest in the survival of the Assad regime.
Given the United States' unwillingness to commit to a long-term investment and the fragile and fractured population, Syria is a place where U.S. irregular warfare could be used to impose costs on an adversary as it attempts to stabilize its ally.
Actions in Syria, as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1980s, could be designed in such a way to limit American direct involvement while also draining Russia and Iran of financial and military resources.
This model could be tailored to appropriately fit other situations globally in a coordinated, but decentralized effort, to overwhelm America's competitors in their attempts to roll back the status quo.
