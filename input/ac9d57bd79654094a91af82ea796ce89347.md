Ukraine-a capable military power on Russia's border-has become and will remain an important factor in the European power balance.
On the one hand, Russia's invasion of Ukraine seems likely to produce a security situation in Europe that is highly unfavorable to Moscow.

If NATO allies deliver on their pledges to increase defense spending and capabilities, the conventional military balance in Europe will continue to shift to Russia's disadvantage.
