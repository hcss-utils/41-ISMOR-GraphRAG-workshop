Both approaches presented problems.
The first was essentially passive--and Britain was too weak militarily to afford the luxury of passivity.
The second might be theoretically effective against France, but France was an increasingly unlikely enemy after 1904.
Germany and Russia were virtually invulnerable to it, particularly if the next general war was as short as the experts predicted.
Operationally, moreover, imperialism's palmy days were over; the buffer zones were gone.
Future conflicts anywhere were likely to be against great powers: perhaps in the Far East against Japan, perhaps in Canada against the United States.
No longer could improvised task forces be dispatched around the globe with the vague sense of all coming right on the night as long as the navy was there.
Imperial security would from now on require the ability to deploy large forces in a wide variety of operational environments.
