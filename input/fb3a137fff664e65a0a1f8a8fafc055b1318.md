Forced to consider a war against both France and Russia, the British did the only thing they could.
Rather than attempt to curry Russian goodwill, London believed that only a show of force would restore its position in the Baltic.
Consequently, the Royal Navy attacked and destroyed part of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen on 2 April 1801.
As a result, Denmark withdrew from the League, but the wheels for its demise already were turning.
The assassination of Tsar Paul in March 1801 and the accession of the anti-French Alexander I led to a change of Russian policy and the League's collapse.
