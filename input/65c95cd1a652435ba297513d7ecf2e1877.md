The Prussians were "latecomer to sea power" necessitating a modification of Moltke's campaign plans in order to shift significant troop detachments for coastal defense.
The French Navy in 1870 consisted of 470 ships and was second only to England's Royal Navy in overall maritime power.
Moltke tasked the Prussian coastal detachments with defending against French marine landings rather than defeating the French Navy.
Prussian technology and doctrine were not geared for land to sea effects.
