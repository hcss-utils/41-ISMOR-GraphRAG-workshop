Russia will also figure prominently in Asia.
The emerging Russian-Chinese partnership is more a reflection of Russian weakness than of a genuine convergence of interests.
Nonetheless, while Russia remains weak, it will continue to seek close relations with China, both to counter U.S. influence and to get much-needed funds from sales of military equipment.
