Stephen Blank contends that the planning for the annexation of Crimea began as early as 2006.

By 2008, with the invasion and pseudo-partition of Georgia, Russia began to demonstrate real intent that may have only been slowed by the election of Yanukovych in Ukraine and Putin's return to office in 2012.
Outright annexation of territory was not part of Russia's action in Georgia.
Russia provided Russian citizenship to the South Ossetians and Abkhaz residents as a pretext for intervention, but neither population are ethnic Russians.
Russia may have been concerned that an actual annexation might increase the potential for outside intervention, but it is more likely that Moscow recognized the benefits of keeping the dispute open-ended.
If the two regions had been annexed, then Georgia may well have cut its loses, relinquished claims to those territories and then pressed harder for NATO membership.
By letting South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain technically Georgian, Russia is able to maintain military bases south of the Caucasus, and continue to frustrate Georgia's efforts to integrate with the West due to the unresolved conflict.
The strategic value of Sevastopol specifically, the symbolic value of Crimea more generally, and Crimea's importance to Ukrainian energy independence would make actual annexation a much more attractive option to Russia than maintaining an unresolved status.
Establishing an unresolved running-sore outside of Crimea, may have been part of the reason for pursuing the subsequent campaign in Donbas.
