This chapter builds on the previous chapter's analysis of cyber power as a military capability by conducting a comparative analysis of the framework used to analyze and evaluate manifestations of U.S. national power.
Referred to as "instruments," the various components of national power categorized in U.S. military doctrine are diplomatic, 39 While Russian military doctrine has addressed cyber considerations through their focus on information warfare since the 1990s, Russia takes an internal security-focused approach through the use of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, as well as cultivating state-friendly and state-dominated commercial entities to lead their cyberspace monitoring efforts.
Additionally, evidence suggests the Kremlin will provide a supportive environment for cyber "mercenaries" who benefit from state covert sponsorship in return for their targeting of Russian adversaries.
