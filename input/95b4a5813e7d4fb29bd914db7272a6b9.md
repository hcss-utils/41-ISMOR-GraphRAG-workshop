This issue of the DTIC Review is intended as an overview of the US strengths and weaknesses in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), with an emphasis on the readiness of the US Military to undertake modern MOUT missions. Participation in future urban military operations is inevitable. More frequently than in the past future missions will require military operation in the cities and their environs. MOUT are extraordinary in their demands on ground and air forces. Today's armed forces must be prepared to conduct combat operations in cities without undue friendly force losses, noncombatant casualties, and collateral damage.
The material that follows will be of interest to planning for or conducting operations and training in urban areas. The information in this issue is for those forces that could possibly deploy to different parts of the world to provide humanitarian assistance to the populace, assist in the restoration of peace between belligerent forces, and possibly conduct peace enforcement operations.

Urban warfare poses many unique challenges not faced by our military forces in recent operations. Of utmost concern is the need to care for the health and welfare of deployed U.S, forces. Disease, the lack of sanitation and death are daily circumstances associated with the collapse of governmental infrastructure, civil war, natural disasters and civil disturbances.
It is not intended to serve as a guide for the conduct of operations and training. Rather, this publication is designed to highlight information and lessons that are applicable to conducting military operations in an urban environment.
The selected documents and bibliography are a representation of the information available on urban warfare from DTIC's extensive collection. Additional references, including electronic resources, can be found at the end of the volume. In-depth literature searches may be requested by contacting the Reference and Retrieval Services Branch at the Defense Technical Information Center: (703) 767-8274/DSN 427-8274; FAX (703) 767-9070; E-mail bibs@dtic.mil I thought back to two incidents during the Gulf War where I served as an attack helicopter pilot in support of the Marine Corps Task Forces pushing north to liberate Kuwait. The first came during the start of the air war while I was operating out of Saudi Arabia. We had just finished our first mission of the war where we had engaged and destroyed an Iraqi outpost that had pinned down a reconnaissance team on the border north of Khafji. We were handed off to an airborne forward air controller (FAC) in an OV-10 who had sighted a truck pulling into a garage in a small coastal village farther north in Kuwait and was ready to control my section in attacking this target. Upon questioning him, I determined that it was not a military vehicle (not necessarily disqualifying it as a target since the Iraqis were operating a wide range of civilian vehicles in the area at the time) and that there was not any obvious military nature to the building. I did not know much about the Laws of War at the time, but it seemed to me that unless we were pretty certain that the house was full of Iraqis soldiers we probably should not attack it. The possibility of knocking down a house full of Kuwaitis civilians who had just popped out to the corner store for a few essentials did not square in my mind with our overall mission of liberating Kuwait. I passed on the mission, but spent more time than was healthy questioning if I had done the right thing.
The second incident occurred while pushing into Southern Kuwait with the First Marine Division. A ground FAC with a tank unit had located an Iraqi observation post and wanted me to engage it with a Hellfire missile. We ran through the normal coordination for the mission, but when I released the missile it either malfunctioned, or more likely homed in on the underspill from vii the controller's targeting laser, and landed a few meters in front of FAC's tank. I was sickened at having come so close to killing some of my fellow Marines (the FAC seemed to take it in stride however). I had never seriously given much thought to the possibility of killing someone I really did not intend to (a mark of my inexperience) and it was with some trepidation that I released a second missile, which did the intended job.
These incidents had a marked effect on me (particularly the second), and are fresh in my mind several years after the fact.
With the Marine Corps' current focus on urban operations in general and limited war, as well as military operations other than war (MOOTW), I once again began thinking about how we can use the firepower that fire support brings to the battlefield. I have set the scope of this paper on the lower end of the combat intensity spectrum, not because collateral damage and noncombatant casualties are not a concern in general war, but because the likelihood of our encountering non-combatants on the battlefield is significantly greater in limited war and MOOTW.
Rather than repeat "limited war and MOOTW" over and over through this paper, I have settled on merely saying "limited war" to mean all combat operations short of a general war. This is a much looser definition than will be found in Joint Publication 1-02 (Dictionary of Military and Related terms), but I hope the reader will not object.
We didn't kill them with prior intent. We killed them because the yawning gap between the unlimited sacrosanct importance which we attribute to our own lives and the very limited sacred character we attribute to the lives of others allowed us to kill them.
As warfighters, members of the United States military services take it as an article of faith that their country will use all the means in its power to protect.them. They know that the lives of a country's service members are its most precious commodity and that their service will spare no effort to prevent their unnecessary death, to rescue them if isolated, and even recover their body if killed. This is the sacred, unspoken pact between the service and the warrior; We will not forsake you, we will not abandon you, if you die we will bring your body back to your family.
These precepts are deeply instilled in all our services, but in particular our ground combat forces. Men will not fight well or for long without this faith in their comrades and service.
The capability and will to protect our people must be absolute.
As I will show, this sine qua non of combat is often in conflict with the tenets of "Just War" theory, particularly these:
" That certain parts of the population, especially noncombatants, be immune from intentional attack.
" That the damage likely to be incurred by the war may not be disproportionate to the injury suffered.
" That only legitimate and moral means may be employed in prosecuting war. This ethical tension, the basic conflict between a warfighter's duty to his comrades and his duty as a member of a professional military is nowhere more evident than in limited urban combat. The confluence of a hostile force embedded within a larger mass of unarmed civilians, and the incredible destructive power of the modern military makes for hard choices over who lives and who dies. And, as we shall see, the likelihood of U.S. forces participating in urban military operations of this kind is increasing.
When Marines deploy into urban areas today and in the future, they will need the flexibility to address a wide variety of crises. In one city block, a Marine will provide food, care, and comfort for an emaciated child. In the next block, you will see this Marine with outstretched arms, separating two warring tribes. Then, in a third city block, this same Marine will engage in intense house-to-house fighting with hostile forces.
The "Three Block War" is a construct used in the Marine Corps to focus attention on the problems of future (and some would say present) urban operations. The basic concepts are: * That an increase of urbanization and concurrent shift in world demographics to city dwelling will occur with over 60% of the world's population living in cities by

During the Cold War, both U.S. and Soviet doctrine preached avoidance of urban conflict. Experience showed that urban centers were to be isolated and bypassed whenever possible. But recent U.S. and Russian experiences have lain to rest the idea that we can avoid urban operations. The unhappy truth is that the overwhelming trend is towards more military involvement in urban settings, not less. The increasing chaos in these future megacities will yield trouble that only a large, well-organized military force can overcome. The U.S. military may be ordered to a city to restore order, rebuild infrastructure, provide medical care, or hand out food and supplies; but it will be ordered there with greater and greater frequency. Moreover, all too often, once there, it will find it necessary to fight.
warfare is regarded as an exception, an occasional and unhappy accident, far away from the mainstream. War, when properly conducted, according to human superstition, belongs in civilisationless open countryside.

Much as some terrain is harder to fight on than others, different populations will cause different challenges in urban combat.
The physical terrain that military forces must consider in urban combat varies immensely. The large megacities in which it may find itself may have one or more business or manufacturing centers with an orderly street layout and large, multistory buildings. Ringing these city centers however, will be an everexpanding mass of residential neighborhoods and slums, some of which will be haphazardly laid out in an undocumented and .
bewildering maze. Construction of buildings will vary from reinforced concrete, glass, metal, and masonry high-rises, to cardboard and tin shacks. The slums will be the areas of focus for humanitarian efforts and counterinsurgency operations, though military operations will take place throughout the dizzying three-dimensional area of urban sprawl, from subterranean tunnels and sewer lines, to the tops of the highest skyscrapers.
The population will be increasingly young, under-educated, under-employed, hungry and dissatisfied. Within their mass will move well-armed criminals, gangs, and insurgents. There may or may not be an operating government with a police force or military. There may be organized militia factions or clans, seeking to establish control over part or all of the city or country.
Operating in the same area, but often with different agendas and varying desires for cooperation, will be an array of international relief organizations. Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO's), Non-Governmental Organization's (NGO's), and foreign governmental entities will simultaneously request assistance from U.S. military forces and seek to maintain a nonaligned and independent nature. They will certainly not willingly provide intelligence information in support of any combat operations, nor will they necessarily observe military 9 restrictions on their movements. Through the very nature of their mission, "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed" regardless of political or religious affiliation, 10 the military will find these workers in the slums and residential centers that threaten to become the focal point for armed conflict. They may even be found providing direct humanitarian assistance to armed groups in conflict with U.S. military forces. Separating their activities from military combat operations will be extremely difficult.
Finally, the independent media will be found in full force on the urban battlefield, as will the information warriors of our future opponents. The ability to independently record and broadcast in real-time, worldwide, every instance of collateral damage or non-comibatant or friendly casualty from the remotest area, gives great advantage to any future belligerent. The ability to erode popular support at home or mission legitimacy throughout the world will be a potent weapon. 11
No one likes CNN to show civilians wounded or killed in urban combat, but I would rather see that than see American soldiers/Marines being dragged through the streets.

The probability is great that United States Forces will become engaged by enemy forces who are intermingled with the civilian population.
The presence of civilians and the desire to limit collateral damage can restrict the use of fires and reduce firepower available to the commander.
Infantryman's Guide to Combat in Built-up Areas, FM 90-I0-11 U.S. rules of engagement provide guidance to the commander in these situations as shown in this extract from the Joint
Inherent Right of Self-Defense. A commander has the authority and obligation to use all necessary means available and to take all appropriate action to defend that commander's unit and other U.S. forces in the vicinity from a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. Neither these rules nor the supplemental measures activated to augment these rules limit this inherent right and obligation. At all times, however, the requirements of necessity and proportionality as amplified in these SROE will be the basis for the judgment of the commander as to what constitutes an appropriate response to a particular hostile act or demonstration of hostile intent.

The intent of this passage is fairly clear; do what is necessary to protect your forces, but be judicious rather than indiscriminate. The final decision is left to the commander and his opinion will, presumably, be accepted without many questions. Except of course, it is not that simple.
The prospect of non-combatants slain, intentionally or not, by the U.S. military is only slightly less disturbing to the American people than the prospect of friendly casualties. Noncombatant casualties and collateral damage are primary cause of international approbation and leads host nations to invite a military force to leave. These things are to be avoided, both from a moral and a practical view.
This desire to avoid unnecessary collateral damage and all non-combatant casualties invariably leads to investigations and recriminations when they occur. For example, at least seven instances of soldiers and Marines firing their weapons in Somalia were criminally prosecuted during the U.S. involvement there. While these prosecutions may have been warranted, and some of the accused were convicted of criminal wrongdoing, the end effect on the deployed force should be obvious. Military personnel, press, and other commentators perceived that investigation and/or prosecution would follow every shooting. 17
This had a restrictive effect on the service member's inclination to fire their weapons even when warranted, and took some time for the commanders on the ground to overcome. Similar events and reactions were found during the U.S. intervention in Panama in 1989, and during the Vietnam conflict.
Of course, it is really the mission commander on the ground who is caught between the proverbial "rock and a hard place". On one hand, he has the duty and the understandable personal desire to see that none of his subordinates come to any harm. On the other, he has the moral and command responsibility to ensure the safety of the non-combatants in his area of operations. The commander is expected to complete his mission without causing it to be curtailed due to domestic outrage over U.S. casualties or international and U.S. outrage over non-combatant casualties.
Of even greater difficulty to the commander is the use of fire support in these situations. The possibility of collateral damage and non-combatant injury is so great that ROE usually restricts approval of the use of these weapons to senior officers. In Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama to oust the dictator Manuel Noriega in 1989, the use of AC-130's, attack helicopters, artillery, and mortars required the approval of a battalion commander or equivalent (Lieutenant Colonel).
Fixed-wing close air support required the approval of a division commander (Major General) or higher!

War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it.

If it is difficult to reach clear consensus on appropriate restrictions for the use of firepower in limited urban combat among members of the U.S. military, it is almost impossible to do so among the international community. Opinions vary considerably depending on the relative importance one places on the lives of the non-combatant civilians compared to the lives of the deployed service members and one's overall involvement with the conflict.
Involving non-combatant civilians in military operations, either by specifically firing upon them or using them as shields 21 against enemy fire is prohibited. Additionally, an attacker must take all reasonable steps to minimize loss of life during attacks on military objectives. Responsibility for noncombatant casualties caused through the intentional use of civilians to discourage attack has traditionally fallen on the party using the civilians as shields rather than his adversary.
Incidental casualties were a "cost of war", and no one could blame a belligerent for the deaths of non-combatants placed in harm's way by an adversary, as long as the attacker exercised ordinary care. In fact, some scholars have viewed that customary law allows the attack of military targets even when a defender has "immunized" the target from attack by surrounding it with non-combatant civilians. To act otherwise would be to actually increase the likelihood that a belligerent would use this (illegal) tactic again.24
There is not complete agreement on this point however. The 1977 Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions sought to shift some of the responsibility from the defender to the attacker for non-combatant casualties caused by using civilians as shields from attack.

"the presence of a few isolated soldiers or guerrilla fighters among a crowd of civilians cannot justify a full-scale attack on the crowd; if there are no other means available, their elimination will have to be postponed." 30   The basic question that we are left with is simply, "How many non-combatant civilians should a country be willing to kill to ensure the safety of its service members"? Like in so many other things, the answer depends on where you sit.
With a better understanding of the issues involved in the use of fire support during military operations in limited urban combat, we turn to two historical vignettes which provide insight into the real difficulties and far-reaching consequences to be found in this environment.
The first example is from the Israeli campaign in South Lebanon known as "Operation Grapes of Wrath". The second example is from the UN peacekeeping mission to Somalia, and specifically the U.S. conduct of a campaign to arrest the Somali clan leader Mohamed Farah Aideed. The Israeli Government launched Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11, 1996, in response to numerous Hizballah operations in South Lebanon and Northern Israel during the preceding months.

In light of the continued terrorist actions by Hizballah, the Israeli Army will intensify its activities against the terrorists stating tomorrow, 14 April 1996. Following the warning broadcast by the Voice of the South to the inhabitants of 45 villages, any presence in these villages will be considered a terrorist one, that is, the terrorists and all those with them will be hit. Any civilian who lags behind in the aforementioned villages and towns will do so on his own responsibility and will put his life in danger.

On 18 April, Hizballah fired two separate volleys of Katyusha rockets from locations around the camp. Around noon they set up a mortar and two hours later began a short mortar barrage. The target was an Israeli patrol in South Lebanon.
According to Maj. Gen. Matan Vilna'i of the Israeli Army:
The mortars began falling 100 meters from the force, then 30 to 40 meters, with shrapnel falling right beside our soldiers. We acted in a matter of minutes to extricate the unit. In that time we had to understand what was4 going on, to relay orders and to stop the enemy fire.
At 1:52 and 1:58 PM Israeli counter-battery radar indicated two separate locations in Qana where the firing had originated.
A crosscheck of the coordinates revealed their proximity to the UNIFIL camp and permission was sought and obtained from higher headquarters to engage the targets. Target coordinates were transmitted to two Israeli artillery batteries, and the missions were fired within 15 minutes of initial detection. 
41
The repercussions from the attack were immediate and widespread. Israel was condemned by most nations, international organizations, and the media. Hizballah and their supporters charged that Israel had intentionally attacked the refugees in the camp. Criticism of the killings was widespread in Israel itself. The United Nations commissioned an investigation that concluded:
"While the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and/or procedural errors.
In some ways, the Israelis were victims of their own prior success and claims of precision. A combination of counter battery radar, remotely piloted vehicles (RPV's), and ground and air spotters had enabled previous artillery strikes to be conducted with great accuracy. The Israeli Army contended that though there was an RPV and two helicopters in the area, these assets were not positioned to adjust the artillery fire at Qana.

The conflict in Somalia and the U.S. involvement there were rooted in a legacy of European colonialism and superpower conflict. Somalia's boundaries were based on the artificial divisions decided when the Italians, French and British divvied up the Horn of Africa in the 1880's. The Somali Republic emerged as a nation foilowing the joining of the British and Italian administered Somalilands in 1960.

The raid on 3 October 1993 in downtown Mogadishu was the turning point in U.S. involvement in Somalia. Grossly underestimating the capabilities and resolve of Aideed's militia, the raid force was quickly pinned down at the raid site by hundreds of militia fighters. Additional irregular volunteers spontaneously joined the fighting, adding firepower to Aideed's forces. 
60

63
Official details of the 15-hour battle are difficult to obtain due to the classification of both the mission and the after action reports. But a few things are clear: * Once the battle had begun, the task force needed large amounts of external fire support. The task force pinned d6wn in the city were too lightly armed to extract themselves, and the reaction force sent to extricate them were too lightly armed to rapidly accomplish the rescue.
Once isolated and engaged, fire support was the only way to protect the task force.
The fire support allocated to the mission was insufficient. In retrospect, the mission required support capable of clearing the numerous roadblocks thrown up by the Somali militia and suppressing the fire from the belligerents that had the raid force pinned down.
Commanders in Somalia requested these assets, including tanks, the week prior to the Task Force Ranger raid but were denied. 
65
66
67
Though troubling, numerous members of the raid force and the rescue columns that relieved them have stated in newspaper interviews that they "fired on crowds and eventually at anyone and anything they saw." 
68
69
The inability of the task force to protect themselves and for the reaction force to quickly rescue them exacted a heavy price. Once the realization of what had happened settled in back in Washington, there were almost immediate calls for a pullout of all U.S. forces in Somalia.

Men who take up arms against one another do not cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to one another and to God. 
Technology improvements and doctrinal updates are only part of the answer. We must enhance our force structure and training to maximize our ability to operate in the urban environment. We must educate or military and political leaders on the costs and hazards of these operations, so that sound decisions on intervention can be made and so that they and our country will be ready for the brutal reality of future urban warfare. And finally, we must as a nation, and as members of the international community, develop the persistence and courage to carry out these operations without forsaking our servicemen and women, or our humanity.

Demographic trends make it a near certainty that future operations will involve more of the same. Population models estimate that 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2025. Seventy percent of these cities will be located on the world's littorals.

Capabilities and techniques must be as simple as possible in order to facilitate their use by combat units without the requirement for extensive training. If this is not feasible, the alternative is to develop capabilities and techniques that are taught to select individuals within a unit, who are then responsible for creating the suspension systems for the other members of their command. Under this concept, a few individuals would receive extensive training in the skill, while the average member of the unit will receive only the training necessary for him to effectively and skillfully utilize the established system. The preferred option is to develop capabilities that are simple and effective enough to be employed by any Marine with limited training.
Just as the requirement exists to traverse the urban environment on or above the ground, the capability to maneuver below the surface must be developed.

A major focus of effort for general engineering of the future will be on virtual reconnaissance. Through the use of information systems, engineers will be able to identify in-theater infrastructure such as water and electrical distribution systems, devise plans for the control or isolation of these systems without destruction, and plan for their follow-on use by friendly forces. This resource harvesting through information management will significantly reduce general engineering requirements specifically, and CSS requirements overall.

Choosing intelligently demands anunderstanding of future contet and concepts. These give us logical backboards against which to bounce various technology altenatives and make operationally sound choices.
The fiflh revision of the Urban Warrior aeqinral fiamemvrk has been reformatted to include photos and diagrams. It remains a draft It may be updated yet again, based on the results of experimentation or to incorporate additional expeimentation opportunities.   The Research Question
To meet the purpose of this study. this thesis will answer the following primary question: Is the Army's current MOUT doctrine adequate to meet current and future requirements?
In order to answer the primary question. this thesis will answer these secondary questions:
1. How does the current doctrine apply to military operations other than war (MOOTW)? 
The following assumptions are required in order to compete the research required for this study:
I. The operations used as a basis for this thesis are representative of the types of operations the Army will face in future operations and conflicts.
2. The adequacy of doctrine is measurable.
The following are terms that are essential to this research study, arranged alphabetically:
Battlefield Operating Systems. The major functions performed by a force on the battlefield to successfully execute Army operations (battles and engagements) in order to accomplish military objectives directed by the operational commander; they include maneuver, fire support, air defense, command and control, intelligence, mobility and survivability, and combat service support. 5
Built-Up Area. A concentration of structures, facilities, and population that form the economical and cultural focus for the surrounding area. The four categories include: large cities (population greater than 100,000), towns and small cities (population between 3,000 and 100,000), villages (population less than 3,000), and Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW or OOTW). Operations that encompass the use of military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war. These military actions can be applied to complement any combination of the other instruments of national power and occur before, during, and after war. 
12
Network Pattern. An urban pattern similar to the satellite but more extensive and complex. Often found in division or higher level sectors. Its satellites are far less dependent on the ccntral hub than the satellite pattern. The network pattern's lines of communications have a rectangular shape rather than the linear shape found in the satellite pattern.14
Peacekeeping. Operations using military forces and/or civilian personnel, at the request of the parties to a dispute, to help supervise a cease-fire agreement and/or separate the parties.' Its surrounding terrain is generally homogenous and its outlying satellites support the principal urban area.18
Tactics. The art and science of employing available means to win battles and engagements. 
'9
War. A state of open and declared armed hostile conflict between political units such as states or nations; may be limited or general in nature. 
20
The following factors are weaknesses associated with this study and are outside the researcher's control:
First is a lack of information about recent European operations. These operations may be too recent to yield a great deal of information. Additionally. the information on hand may be classified and thus difficult to attain or unavailable.
Second. because some operations were categorized as humanitarian or peacekeeping in nature and not actual combat. no information was gathered related to MOUT. U.S. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia are an example of this category of information.
The following factors constrain this study to assure its feasibility:
1. The study only examines conventional warfare. It does not include treatment of unconventional, special operations, or other types of operations the Army currently executes.
2. This thesis will use case studies of operations occurring within the past fifteen years. These operations will provide sufficient and comparable information for analysis while. Fighting as a combined arms team in World War II was a relatively new concept. Though new, MOUT doctrine during that time reflected this combined arms approach. In offensive operations, FM 31-50 stressed fighting as a combined, synchronized force. Artillery and air support fired heavy preparatory fires into the built-up area, followed by the armor force encircling the town. Infantry troops, along with some armor then penetrated the defense and went from building to building to "mop up" any remaining resistance. The attacker used armor and infantry as a combined arms team. 
2
Because of the offensive nature of World War II, MOUT doctrine in FM 3 1-50
gave very light treatment to defensive operations in built-up areas. It provided only a small amount of guidance on establishing a defense in a built-up area.
In summary, FM 31-50 is an offensively oriented publication, reflecting the fast paced, total war environment seen by the Army in World War II. It advocates bypassing built-up areas rather than expending resources, tying up forces and slowing down the tempo of the offensive. FM 3 1-50 bases its doctrine on using firepower and combined arms attacks to encircle the enemy, penetrate his defenses, and defeat him as quickly and decisively as possible. Since FM 90-10 assumed that the next war would be in Europe and with the Soviet Union, it followed that that conflict would be high intensity in nature. This  FM 90-10-1 gives a varied analysis and description of a wide range of urban setting. Unlike FM 90-10, FM 90-10-1 does not restrict its discussion of urban terrain to a European setting. FM 90-10-1 gives a brief overview of the similarities and dissimilarities between urban areas found in different regions of the world, but this discussion does not address the specific types of construction and city layout found in each geographic region described in the manual.

This manual gives a great deal of detail on the conduct of MOUT.  operations, show of force, support to civil authorities, and support to counterdrug operations.

FM 71-2 contributes the combat operations for the mission analytical tool. The offensive operations are hasty attack, deliberate attack, and attack of a strongpoint.
The defensive operations are defense of a sector, defense of a battle position, and defense of a strongpoint.
The minimum criteria for the mission area analysis is the presence of an applicable MOUT doctrine for the missions listed above. If the publications do not contain MOUT doctrine for all of the missions listed, then the doctrine is inadequate.
The METT-T model uses the enemy label to account for the opposing force in a military operation. The term enemy refers to "a hostile power or force. such as a nation." ' This definition is too restrictive. It suggests that another force must be a nation or represent some legitimate body such as a goverment in order to be a hostile force. Threat. or "one that is regarded as a possible danger. menace" is far more suitable in describing the forces that the Army faces in modern operations. This definition covers a hostile power or force in the form of a nation. while also describing less organized. less legitimate opponents. Some argue that soldiers' use of threat makes the range of possible opponents far too broad to manage. This definition simply reflects diversity of the forces and opponents facing the United States today.
This study will use threat as a tool to evaluate the adequacy of MOUT doctrine by addressing the following question: Does Army MOUT doctrine assist the commander in identifying all of the potential dangers or menaces facing his force?
The minimum criteria for adequacy of MOUT threat doctrine is the presence of doctrine for both conventional and unconventional threats. A conventional threat refers to a force sponsored and fielded by a constituted political unit like a state or nation. 
4
Terrorists may be nonstate supported, state supported or state directed. 
6
The minimum criteria for this test covers two areas. First, whether or not MOUT doctrine gives the commander the ability to do the traditional terrain analysisobservation, cover and concealment, obstacles, key terrain, and avenues of approach (OCOKA). Second, whether or not MOUT doctrine give the commander the ability to understand key systems within the urban environment and their operational value to the him and the threat. Those systems are utilities, communications, transportation, waste management, civil order, and government. The second tool used in this thesis' methodology is the use of historical vignettes of MOUT battles. The battles in Chechnya and Mogadishu serve several valuable purposes. First, in addition to their presentation of the facts of a MOUT
battle, this study will analyze each the lessons learned from the battle. The purpose of that analysis is to assist the reader in evaluating the status of MOUT doctrine.
Additionally, historical vignettes provide the reader with a broader perspective of military operations than might otherwise be gained through a doctrinal review. Next, the majority of Army doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures is developed from a similar process. Finally, this study will analyze each battle using mission, threat, terrain and technology. Those responsible for a particular area start with an existing document, like FM 90-10. They then use accumulated experiences to update and make changes to that document. Finally, this study will analyze the historical vignettes against the mission, threat, terrain and technology tools to provide additional basis for conclusions and recommendations.
This study's analytical process has several inherent strengths. The first strength is consistency. The researcher may apply this process across a range of types of operations as well as at different levels of warfare. from the platoon to the Army level. Validity is this process' second strength. The study's process of examination of military history is widely accepted and used by the military community to examine the adequacy of doctrine.9 Additionally, recent experiences indicate that urban operations will not be incidental, but an integral part of military operations as the world continues to urbanize and the Army continues its force projection stance. The results of these tests yield sound results. Next, the study's tools are acceptable and familiar to the military community. Furthermore. the tools are integral parts of the military decision-making process and a part of each military operation. Finally. the tools used in this process are rigorous. The scope of the test is broad enough to yield wellfounded results. but at the same time, not too cumbersome.
The main weakness associated with this type of analytical tool is the potential difficulty in measuring some of the individual tools. If MOUT doctrine addresses the majority of the offensive operations conducted by a battalion task force in urban terrain, then the doctrine is adequate. In this study, MOUT doctrine must meet the minimum standards established for each of the analytical tools, otherwise it is inadequate. These tools represent the pertinent issues facing the Army and are all essential for success in an urban environment, operating throughout the spectrum of conflict, including operations other than war.
Conclusions may be drawn from this analytical process. Foremost, tile process discusses the adequacy of MOUT doctrine when compared to the current military environment, outlined using mission, threat. terrain, and technology. From this test of adequacy. the strengths and deficiencies in current MOUT doctrine may be identified. among other lessons, the effect of a firepower-based doctrine applied in to a modern.
European-style environment. American fighting in Mogadishu holds several lessons for the MOUT student. Foremost, the potential for disaster in an operation short of war with limited rules of engagement and an unconventional enemy bent on defeating a force.
This section will compare Army MOUT doctrine and its treatment of the various missions possibly facing a battalion task force in current and future urban operations. Though a battalion task force might not conduct all of these missions as an autonomous entity. the battalion full) be expected to participate in all of these missions as a part of a larger force.
The missions included in the analysis of doctrine for offensive operations include: hastv' attack. deliberate attack, attack of a strongpoint, and attacks and raids.
This study will compare each of these missions to the doctrine outlined in the following manuals. FM 90-10's second special situation describes attacking to gain a foothold.
Though the manual does not specifically refer to it as a deliberate attack, this operation resembles a deliberate attack. Like the first special situation, this situation describes the commander's actions, the actions of the specific battlefield operating systems, and the control measured used in the operation.
FM 90-10 does not address the doctrine supporting a battalion task force's attack of a strongpoint or attacks and raids in an urban environment. A task force can expect to conduct each of these operations in an urban environment.
FM 90-10-1, An Infantryman's Guide to Combat in Built-Up Areas FM 90-10-1 devotes a little more than a paragraph to the conduct of a hasty attack in an urban area. Its coverage does not give the commander the tools he needs to conduct the operation.
FM 90-10-1 addresses the deliberate attack in more detail than the hasty attack.
It covers the steps involved in the operation. including reconnoiter of the objective, movement to the objective, securing a foothold. and clearance of a built up area.
This manual does not specifically address the attack of a strongpoint. or urban attacks and raids. It does. however, treat how a company team might attack an enemy outpost and key terrain as a part of a battalion task force.
FM 71-3, The Armored and Mechanized Infantry Brigade Though this manual covers offensive operations at the brigade level, it does does not mention offensive operations on urbanized terrain. Furthermore. it does not give any information on urban combat of any type.
FM 71-2. The Tank and Mechanized Infantry Battalion Task Force FM 71-2 does not address hasty or deliberate attacks, attack on a strongpoint.
or attacks and raids in urban environments. Its treatment of operations on urban terrain are limited to generalities about the conditions in urban settings. FM 71-2 refers the reader to FM 90-10 for guidance on operations in urban terrain.
The missions included in the analysis of doctrine for defensive operations are FM 90-10-1 does not specifically cover defense of a battle position or defense of a strongpoint. The manual does, however, treat the defense of a village in a manner closely resembling that of a strongpoint. It goes so far as to state that the battalion with a village in their sector could "incorporate the village as a strongpoint in its defense. " ' The manual's discussion of defense of a village is short, covering employment of major weapon systems. security, and mobility/countermobility.
FM 71-3. The Armored and Mechanized Infantry Brigade Though this manual covers defensive operations at the brigade level, it does does not mention defensive operations on urbanized terrain. Furthermore, it does not give any information on urban combat of any type.
FM 71-2, The Tank and Mechanized Infantry Battalion Task Force
This manual devotes two pages to battalion task force defensive operations in urban terrain, one of which is a diagram depicting a typical task force sector defense.
The manual covers general topics like the amount of terrain a task force will defend, the types of maneuver a task force uses in an urban defense, employment of major weapon systems. and effects of terrain on friendly and enemy courses of action.
The missions included in the analysis of doctrine for military operations other than war are combatting terrorism, disaster relief, nation assistance, support to counterinsurgency, peace operations. show of force, support to civil authorities, and support to counterdrug operations. The only reference in this manual to potential threats is in its offensive and defensive sections covering how the enemy defends and how the enemy attacks. In each case.
the only enemy or threat to which the manual refers is the coldwar-era Soviet Union force. This force employs Soviet doctrine, using Soviet weapon systems. Additionally, it covers several of the social, political, cultural, and economic factors shaping a threat's actions.
FM 71-3, The Armored and Mechanized Infantry Brigade
This manual briefly states that the Army can no longer anticipate facing a single, monolithic, well-defined threat. It states that American forces can count on facing a range of forces, from major regional powers to terrorist groups. These threats are more diverse and less predictable than the Soviet threat of the coldwar. This fact forces us to conduct a rigorous and continuous intelligence preparation of the battlefield. 
2
It does not address how he conducts these operations in an urban environment.
This manual also addresses threat actions in its section discussing the task force level IPB process. This discussion, like the other sections, refers to a singular Soviet-style threat and no others.
The doctrinal treatment of the threat is adequate. FM 90-10-1 gives the commander the basic tools he requires to evaluate both conventional and unconventional threats.
This section seeks to answer whether or not Army MOUT doctrine provides the MOUT commander a means to identify the tactical or operational significance of the objective? This section's answer to this question is more in keeping with the idea of initiative based warfare and giving the commander the freedom to think and act. rather than acting out of habit or repetition. This manual covers the value of some areas to the task force commander. For example. it discusses the value of public baths, swimming facilities, and cisterns in providing potable water sources in the event conventional or unconventional forces render traditional sources inoperable.
Though this manual states that "urban combat is only combat in different terrain." it goes on to state the importance of a commander understanding the value of tactical or operational targets like power generation or gas production facilities to an opponent, especially in an operation short of war. These types of facilities are prime terrorist or insurgent targets and may have strategic level significance in a small country.
FM 71-3, The Armored and Mechanized Infantry Brigade This manual does not address terrain analysis relating to MOUT. Additionally, it does not address the operational or tactical value of terrain to the MOUT battalion task force commander.
FM 71-2, The Tank and Mechanized Infantry Battalion Task Force This manual's restricts its treatment of terrain analysis to non-urban, rural terrain.
Furthermore, it does not contain a means to analyze urban terrain for its tactical characteristics or its value as an tactical or operational target.
The test for adequacy for terrain analysis reveals that MOUT doctrine is inadequate. While it gives the commander the ability to do the traditional OCOKA terrain analysis, it does not give the commander the ability to understand key systems within the urban environment and their operational value to the him and the threat.
Those systems are utilities, communications, transportation, waste management, civil order, and government.
This section of the study will reveal the answer to the following question:
Does current MOUT doctrine give the MOUT commander the means to employ the weapons technology and use the information systems available to him while countering the technology available to his opponent? This technology covers a broad spectrum of items, ranging from the commonplace Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, to relations with the media in a MOUT operation. This manual briefly examines the use of demolitions in breaching walls. This section gives instruction in the principles of demolitions in urban combat.
This manual dedicates an entire chapter to combat support, including artillery.
engineer. aviation, air defense, military police, chemical, and communication assets.
This section is very general and does not describe any of the weapon systems or technology available to the commander in MOUT.
FM 90-10-1. An Infantryman's Guide to Combat in Built-Up Areas
This manual gives extensive coverage to the modern technology available to American commanders and threat commanders in a MOUT situation. It predicts that many third world countries will soon be able to afford technologically advanced systems. previously only available to a few select countries. The manual lists these systems, ranging from precision guided munitions to improved communications capabilities.
FM90-10-1 briefly discusses the value of the global positioning system (GPS)
for use in navigating through urban terrain. Though it states that the GPS will likely be effective in a city, it does not outline the various ways a commander might use GPS to gain an advantage over his opponents.
The combat support section of FM 90-10-1 is far more detailed than that of FM 90-10. FM 90-10-1 covers mortars, artillery, naval gunfire, tactical air support, air defense, Army aviation, military police, and communications in MOUT. This manual gives a detailed description of the urban combat capabilities of each of these systems and goes into much greater detail about the specific systems available to the MOUT commander.
This manual briefly describes how an urban force commander might interface with the media. It does not cover the potential value of favorable relations with the media or, more importantly, the potential harm unfavorable media relations might have on an Army MOUT commander. Moreover, it does not address the effect of almost instant worldwide communications on urban operations.
This manual covers the weapons systems available in MOUT in great detail.
These systems include rifles, machineguns of all sizes, grenade launchers, antitank weapons, flame weapons, grenade launchers, demolitions, aerial weapons, tanks and fighting vehicles. It also covers the employment of naval and artillery gunfire. This section of the manual describes the weapon system and its variations, its employment in MOUT, and the potential effects and considerations of using that weapon system in an urban environment.
FM 71-3, The Armored and Mechanized Infantry Brigade FM 71-3 has a section describing the integration of a heavy force with light infantry and special operations forces. This section details the integration of these units and the systems associated with them, but in very general terms. Additionally, it does not discuss these issues in relation to a MOUT setting. indicates that urban fighting will become more frequent in the future. The Army will be drawn to city fighting. either by the strategic or operational value of the city. or simply through the urbanization of the world. In any case, the Army will certainly operate more frequently in urban settings in the future. Furthermore, the Army must be prepared to apply both firepower and non-firepower based solutions to urban fighting. The following vignettes illustrate these points using both ends of the spectrum. The Russians in Grozny arrived prepared to apply a firepower based solution to attacking the city, when a non-firepower based solution would have been far more successful. In the other vignette, the U.S. forces in Somalia, through mission creep, lost the ability to apply a firepower solution when the situation clearly warranted doing so.
The Russian republic of Chechnya was in rebellion against the Moscow government. Moscow's response was to send three invasion columns into Chechnya to stop the rebellion and to keep the republic in the nation. These columns were not the Russians held in awe by American forces during the cold war. They were mostly conscripts, poorly trained and their morale was low. On the other hand, the rebels, though until recently Russians themselves, were well supplied, operating on their home territory and their morale was high. 
3
Since the Russians and Chechnyan rebels began as soldiers in the same army, it follows that they shared a common MOUT doctrine. Like American MOUT doctrine, the Russians favored bypassing built-up areas when possible, leaving them for following second echelon forces. If bypassing was not possible, either because of the value of the area or time, the Russians planned to quickly attack from the march in order to keep the defender from building a credible defensive force. These attacks from the march were difficult to control and often required more freedom of action and training for the urban area commander than the Russian doctrine found appropriate. If the attack from the march was not possible and the city was still valuable to the effort, the attacker blockaded the urban area. guarded it with a covering force and left it to starve.
The Russians used armor as assault force in MOUT or as a supporting force for the assaulting infantry troops. Additionally, airborne or air assault forces attacked key terrain to seize terrain along avenues of advance or to act as a forward reconnaissance element for the advancing assault force. Russian MOUT doctrine centered around always delivering a high volume of fire. Their doctrine stresses the use of all levels of buildings. from the basement to the top floors, not just the ground floor. In the defense, the Russians stressed a flexible and mobile approach to defending urban areas.
When the Russians attacked the rebels in the Chechnyan capital of Grozny in late 1994. they expected rebel resistance to be weak at best. The Russians began their attack with a erratic, but week long air and artillery strikes that built to a crescendo as they planned to start their assault on New Year's Eve, 1994. Their main objective was the city's railway station. The Russian forces numbered approximately 2,000. while the rebels mustered approximately 5.000 men. The Russian advance began at about 1300. with armor moving along the city's main avenues. The Russians placed heavy and accurate fire along both sides of the streets. The rebels withdrew initially to draw the Russian armor deeper into the city. The Russians planned to conduct a combined arms assault, with the armor supporting the infantry. What resulted was that the infantry waited too long to dismount from the armor. yielding easy targets for rebel gunners firing from above the vehicles. 5
Like their doctrine states, the Russian assault on Grozny was to begin with an air assault to the center of town and on top of key buildings. The infantry and armor force were to subsequently link up with the air assault force.
The rebel tactics were simple. Allow a vehicle to pass and shoot it in the rear, destroying it and blocking passage for following vehicles. As the occupants evacuated the vehicle, the rebels killed them one by one. The rebels took this technique directly from the Afghans. This was very effective and caused great panic and disorientation in the attacking force. The rebels did not restrict their defense to the confines of the city. They ventured outside the city to attack the Russians follow-on echelons and their artillery stationed outside the city. The Chechnyans also used the limited media available to them to their advantage. Chechnyan television broadcasted live action footage continuously throughout the battle. 6
The New Year's Eve battle for Grozny was a success for the rebels. They destroyed 20 of 26 tanks, 100 of 120 armored personnel carriers, and caused 500
Russian casualties.
The Russian seizure of Grozny applied a firepower solution when something less was clearly required. First, the Russians attacked their own people. They could gain nothing by killing hundreds of people in an attempt to reunite the country. This hardened the rebels' resolve and only served to motivate the rebels to fight and further divide the country. Second, the Russians destroyed a large portion of the city during their attack, only to have to rebuild the city after the fighting ended. The Russians were sent to secure the city and did so using firepower alone. They failed to understand the need for a more peaceful solution to this problem, while their doctrine did not provide a non firepower based solution. As a result, the Russians failed to achieve their goal.
The Russians have doctrine for MOUT fighting against a conventional threat.
In this case. their threat was unconventional in nature. Their lack of doctrine against " an unconventional threat contributed to their early losses in this operation.
The Russians failed to understand and appraise their enemy. They should have studied and fully evaluated their threat and refined their intelligence estimates to reflect the rebel's training, disposition, and will to fight. Instead, the Russians assumed their threat would be weak at best. Had the Russians fully understood the nature of their opponent. a solution might have been to fully isolate the rebels and starve them into submission.
Since this battle took place on Russian soil. the Russians should have been and
were intimately familiar with the terrain and its peculiarities. They conducted a military analysis of the terrain without understanding the implications and values of specific targets within the terrain.
The battle for Grozny is reinforcement of the fact that technological advantages diminish in urban fighting. The rebels used proven, simple techniques and equipment to defeat a more advanced and better equipped force. The rebels did use available technology to their advantage by establishing a system of command detonated mines throughout Grozny, controlled by the phone system. For unknown reasons, they never used the mines, but later Russian Spetnaz forces disarmed the system. 7
The Russians did not synchronize the use of their own technology to overpower the rebels. Though a firepower-based solution was viable, the Russians failed to concentrate their overwhelming combat power to defeat the rebels.
The Russians learned from some of their initial mistakes in their attack on Grozny. They continued the attack and were able to take the city by the end of February 1995. By that time, most of the city was rubbled and 300,000 of the city's 400,000 residents had become refugees. 8
Mogadishu, 1993
America's involvement in Somalia began as a humanitarian mission and by 1993 had turned, through mission creep, into something far more involved and broader in scope. The event that triggered the famous American battle in the streets of Mogadishu was not over the distribution of meals to starving Somalis, but over the capture by American Task Force Ranger of twenty-four Somali prisoners, two of which were men of fleeing Somali militia leader, Mohamed Farah Aideed. 9 Colonel Sharif Hassan Giumale was the Somali militia leader who orchestrated the Somali attack on the Americans on 3 October 1993. Colonel Guimale ordered Colonel Ali Aden to organize his men and "don't let reinforcements reach the enemy pocket."1 0
The pocket to which Colonel Guimale referred was the one the Somalis formed around
Task Force Ranger at the building containing the twenty-four prisoners.II Colonel Aden's plan was simple. He organized his men into six squads of six or seven men and had them fade into the throngs of Somalis filling the area near where Task Force Ranger held its captives, preparing them for evacuation. Additionally, in an ambush. A third helicopter attempting to deposit forces at the second crash site was hit with a rocket and forced to make a crash landing. All four crew members survived. 's By this time, it was dark. The Somalis were successful so far. The Somalis trapped the Americans in the pocket and denied American reinforcements, though the Americans dropped supplies by air into the pocket. To the Somalis' count, they destroyed two American helicopters and damaged three others. General Aideed issued further orders to Colonel Guimale, instructing him to strengthen his positions, continue to prevent any American reinforcement, and, above all, prevent the Americans from escaping. The two Somalis communicated using couriers to keep the Americans from locating them and eavesdropping on their radio conversations.
Colonel Guimale considered firing his six 60mm mortars at the trapped Americans in an effort to finalize their destruction. He decided against the mortar attack in order to prevent additional civilian casualties. None of the manuals gives the commander the ability to understand the systems of the city and their impact on his and his enemy's operations. Utilities, communications. transportation, waste management, civil order, and government are all systems that the MOUT commander must understand in order to be successful.
The Grozny vignette reminded us that a force must have other means to operate in an urban setting than a firepower based solution.
Understanding terrain and the value of various facilities is key in urban combat. The Somalis had a great understanding of the terrain simply because they were native to it. but the) also understood the tactical and operational value of components and facilities. Conversely, the Americans failed to understand the value of the terrain and were unable to use it to their advantage.    
SAMPLE ----------
The MOUT ACTD is series of related field experiments designed to demonstrate the military worth of new concepts and technologies in the MOUT environment. The ACTD will be conducted in two iterations. Each iteration will consist of a two-year search for, and initial demonstration of, mature technologies to meet the user requirements, culminating in a series of field experiments to demonstrate the military value added of those capabilities. It will also set the stage for rapid acquisition of those technology applications, which are deemed valuable by the users.'
Military Operations in Built-Up Areas (MOBA) -A term synonymous with MOUT.
Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) is the likely future environment facing Joint Task Force Commanders. This unique battlefield environment will require the best efforts of U.S. forces to ensure victory. The recognition by doctrine writers and senior leaders that MOUT and Military Operation Other Than War (MOOTW) are strongly linked will be an important factor in the success of future MOUT. By applying this relationship, future MOUT doctrine can be focused to include an emphasis on all levels of conflict instead of only on the higher end of the conflict spectrum.
An integrated approach to MOUT is required in order to achieve victory in the future. This integrated approach states that through an examination and focus in the areas of doctrine, training, organizational design, technology, and the Warrior, U.S. forces will be best prepared for future MOUT. For the purposes of this paper, the term 'Warrior" is defined as all individual combatants regardless of branch of service (i.e. soldier, sailor or marine).
Current and near-term MOUT efforts must also be examined. Illustrative of such an operation was the Battle of Berlin (April--May 1945). A Russian soldier described the street to street fighting in the following manner:
Deploying into assault squads and assault groups with each corps holding at least one division in reservethe 3d Shock Units proceeded to lay down massive artillery fire, blasting away yard by yard, sitting guns in any open space and lining up the Katyusha rocket launchers to fire phosphorus into strong points and buildings, setting offfires' Rather than fight for individual buildings, the tanks would go forward and blow them to pieces section by section, eliminating snipers. Sheltering civilians, huddled in basements and underground shelters, found themselves in the thick of this ferocious fighting, choking, blinded and maimed amidst the thunder of explosive charges or swept by the terrifying spurts of flame-throwers. Dragging the dead and dying out of the rubble at street level exposed the inhabitants to the sportive habits of Soviet airmen, diving down to rake streets, soldiers, fire fighters and anything that moved'"
This description of MOUlT warfare in World War II describes a less constrained era in the conduct of war. This mindset continued into the 20th Century.
In the age of air power and of the missile-armed field army, it is inconceivable that any batte for a city will be fought through street by street, district by district, to the finish. The issue will be decided well before that time by the intervention of air bombardment and the most 'Frederickson, pg. 583
Frederickson, pg. 583 destructive heavy weapons under the control of the field army, according to which side has command of the air. The fighting will end in the retirement or capitulation of one side well before the city can be half taken or, on the other han4 wholly re-won by the defendingforce. "'
Combat in MOUT today, by comparison, is characterized by such descriptive terminology as "surgical MOUT" (operations conducted by joint special operations forces--such as raids, recovery operations, and rescues), and "precision MOUT"'
(operations undertaken by conventional forces to defeat an enemy that is mixed with noncombatants)."' Both descriptive terms connote a concern for collateral damage that is conspicuously absent (and perhaps technologically unfeasible) from the preceding description of the street fighting in Berlin during World War II.
Characteristics of the Future. Future MOUT will embrace the full range of military operations, but will most likely focus on the lower end of the conflict spectrum.
The MOUT challenge of the future will not be meeting an enemy force on force. I can see situations where we will be required to use many or all of our offensive capabilities, but this will be the exception. This is not the environment of the future. We will be in the urban areas. Our problem is not that we have to conquer the urban areas as much as we may have to become Marshall, pg. 31 FM 90-10-1 the city manager.
Additionally, future operations predominately will focus on control of populations and territory by not only combat arms forces, but combat support and service support forces as well.
Technologically extended battlespace will manifest itself at the tactical level.
Enhanced communications will translate into increased potential lethality making fulldimensional, simultaneous attack possible. Precision Engagement technologies will provide U.S. forces with a capability to strike at multiple locations, while ensuring minimal exposure of friendly forces. At the same time, employment of increasingly lethal weapons will be constrained by the scrutiny of players in the international media, international organizations, and individual political figures. The specter of excessive collateral damage witnessed by these players has become an issue made more visible by our own information technology advancements.
In future MOUT, "information technologies will be relied upon to increase the volume, accuracy, and speed as well as dissemination of battlefield information to commanders, allowing organizations to overmatch adversaries in this capability."" i Superiority in information technologies can be a two edged sword. The possession of superior informational capabilities does not automatically bring with it a parallel, embedded capacity to protect and sustain this advantage. This cautionary note is especially true of military applied information technologies which can trace many of their origins to "off-the-shelf" civilian hardware. These technologies are available, may be acquired by our enemies, and must be countered if so acquired. vLTG Zinni Interview, 5 Dec 96 Additionally, the proliferation of joint, multinational, and interagency information nodes in the face of extended lines of communications and finite security resources will broaden the vulnerabilities of such information facilities, systems, and functions. Sophisticated or unsophisticated threat forces can disrupt these information systems.
Over-reliance on information technology will make U.S. forces vulnerable if appropriate counter-measures are not in place.
Stress on leaders, warriors, and staffs, precipitated by the intensity of MOUT, will remain a core issue into the 21st century. Overload of battlefield information precipitated by advances in technology will add to the burden of U.S. forces. Enlightened rules of engagement (ROE), supporting Rules of Interaction (ROI), force protection, (to include fratricide avoidance measures), and a clearly defined and achievable end, should help in mitigating against this stress.
"TRADOC PAM 525-5, pg. 1-5
A future threat assessment is included at the appendix"". This assessment examines threat and friendly force doctrine, training, organizational design and technology and defines the environment within which future MOUT will be executed. By doing so, comparisons between threat and friendly forces can be made. Several key elements are identified in the Threat Assessment. First, changes in Threat forces will occur in doctrine, training, organizational design and technology. These changes will occur over time and will be influenced by many factors. Second, likely future enablers for threat forces will be: Furthermore:
"The MOUT ACTD is designed to demonstrate the military worth of new technologies which when placed in the hands of Soldiers and Marines will increase their command and control capabilities, lethality and survivability. It will also set the stage for rapid acquisition of those technology applications which are deemed valuable by the users.
The MOUT ACTD will accomplish this objective by identifying and evaluating new technology for relevance and insertion into the process to support the MOUT ACTD objective.
The ACTD will be conducted in two iterations. Each iteration will consist of a two-year search for and initial demonstration of mature technologies to meet the user requirements, culminating in a series of v Burgess, pg. 1 field experiments to demonstrate the military value added of those capabilities. Following the field experiments will be a two-year residual period during which the experimental technologies remain with the experimental unit in order for that unit to finalize the associated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (7Ms) and other integration issues for that piece of equipment The ACTD will execute the two iterations of experimentation (FY 97-98 and FY 99-00) each followed by a two year residual period The first iteration will focus on mature technologies with the latter focusing on a full-spectrum MOUT capability.'
Throughout this experimentation process, some technologies will fail, concepts will be applied which will not work and other changes will be made. Following the successful identification and validation of candidate technologies, required changes in DTLOMS would be completed. This process of identification, experimentation, and insertion will be iterative. The MOUT ACTD, like the USMC Sea Dragon Initiative, is of a near term focus (10 years or less). While the focus of these two initiatives is near term, they will provide far-reaching and significant impacts on future MOUT warfare. The 
Several key components and concepts are focused to directly support the Sea Dragon": " Naval units, infused with emerging technology, conducting operations dispersed in breadth and depth across an extended seamless littoral battlefield " A Command and Control paradigm which combines a new decision process with decentralized information dissemination to the user level " Exploitation of long range fire and accurate indirect fires from mobile dispersed systems " Utilization of enhanced mobility, survivability, communications and sustainment to execute a maneuver warfare approach, limit force exposure and gain a decisive advantage " Employment of less than lethal technologies to increase the repertoire of tools and options available to expeditionary forces The CWL is the agency responsible for implementing Sea Dragon. The CWL, based at Quantico Marine Corps Base, is uniquely suited to implement this concept. The charter of the CWL is much like that of the DBBL. Both agencies are designed to experiment with new technology and concepts to support future warfighting requirements.
The 5YEP for Sea Dragon includes the following three major events:
Hunter Warrior -Small unit operations on a dispersed, open battlefield. Units conduct intelligence gathering and targeting. C2 by Special Purpose Marine Air/Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) (X) CE. Target STARTEX -3rd QTR 97.
Urban Warrior -Operations in urban, near urban, and close terrain. Units conduct intelligence gathering, targeting, maneuver, and close combat. C2 by MEF (Fwd) CE. Target STARTEX -3rd QTR 1999 Capable Warrior -NEF (MEF/Fleet) level operations combining virtual and live forces comprising operational level deception and maneuver in response to crisis, with the objective of containing/obviating incipient MRC.
These events all have unique objectives, but all support the overarching Sea Dragon objective previously identified. This process will use a (SPMAGTF) as the experimentation force, which will allow for continuity throughout the five-year experimentation process. The SPMAGTF Headquarters element is permanently assigned to the CWL to ensure continuity of effort. Several LOEs will be conducted in between and in support of the three major experiments just outlined.
Conclusion. The Sea Dragon Initiative spearheaded by the CWL is another component in our effort to dominate the future MOUT environment. The vision of USMC operations in the 21st Century is embodied in Sea Dragon. Their "quest for relevance" and acknowledgment of changing battlefield environments will ensure Naval Expeditionary forces are prepared to fight and win in the future MOUT environment.
The MOUT ACTD and Sea Dragon ACTD are individual service efforts to better define the near tern MOUT environment and ensure U.S. forces dominate that environment regardless of foe and/or conditions present. The process used in both efforts accomplishes many of the key components likely for victory in future MOUT. These components include, but are not limited to:
By applying these components, U.S. forces will achieve victory in future MOUT. Direct Input from the Warrior One of the most important components of successful combat developments efforts is to ensure that the user has input into a system before it is fielded. During development of many past combat systems, "users conferences" have convened in which no user was present. Often, many of those in attendance had little or no military experience. In the case of the DBBL, the user input is the key to their success.
Warriors from a variety of units such as the 82nd ABN Division and 101st AASLT Division provide experimentation personnel for DBBL Advanced warfighting Experiments (AWEs) and Battle Lab Experiments (BLEs). The U.S. defense community is not alone when it comes to fully integrating the user in the combat developments process. The following example provided by a combat developer from the United Kingdom demonstrates commonality amongst the combat development community.
The bottom line on experimentation with emerging technology is that user requirements must be met. These requirements cannot be achieved if the user is not an integrated part of the process. Other factors such as senior ofticer/NCO participation, industry/contractor influences, available resources, etc., can often interfere with direct Warrior level input. The DBBL and CWL continue to ensure that Warrior level input is a key component of their respective experimentation programs. 
As previously mentioned, the likelihood of high intensity conflict in future MOUT * Defense Science Board Task Force on Military Operations in Built-up Areas (MOBA), pg. 2
will remain low. To that end, a discussion is required on how U.S. forces will best deal with the lower end of the conflict spectrum. The above fisted factors primarily focus on this level of future MOUT.
Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW). Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) encompass a wide range of functions for U.S. forces. These functions are relevant to all members of the Joint community and the combined arms team. Combat, combat support and combat service support expertise is required in MOOTW. The bottom line is that the likely environment for MOOTW is the MOUT environment. The future MOUT environment will likely require U.S. forces to be flexible in assuming many non-traditional functions.
The U.S. military will likely find itself conducting these non-traditional functions (in MOOTH) mainly because no one else in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) has the organic capability to do so. These nontraditional functions will require us to use non-traditional TTPS. Future MOUT will likely be at the lower end of the conflict spectrum and will require us to befleible, innovative and be prepared to perform non-traditional functions."
Joint doctrine must become broader and accomplish more of the lower end of the conflict spectrum.w
The recognition by doctrine writers and senior leaders that MOUT and MOOTW are strongly linked will be an important factor in the success of future MOUT. By applying this relationship, future MOUT doctrine can be focused to include an emphasis on all levels of conflict. 
This type of environment requires MP Battalions. ....
Digitization. Digitization will provide the future individual Warrior the capability to see the battlefield in real time, communicate with leaders in all environments and act as a LTG Zinni Interview, 5 Dec 96 system feeding into the Precision Engagement network. These capabilities will make the future Warrior more effective in future MOUT throughout the entire range of military operations. When required, Warriors will provide leaders the capability of quick battlefield assessment, target prioritization, and elimination. At the lower end of the conflict spectrum, these organic digitization capabilities will allow leaders at all levels to get real time imagery of day-to-day activities in the future MOUT environment.
As the Army moves toward terrain visualization in FORCE xxi, hard copy paper maps and products are giving way to a digital, information based system. The information based system provides digital maps and analyses which feed into the battle command systems directly, as well as indirectly through mission planning and rehearsal systems and simulations."'' This increased capability to communicate down to the individual Warrior will significantly affect all aspects of future MOUT. Future Joint and service doctrine must ensure that the full impact of digitization is analyzed and incorporated. Digitization will be a key component of success in future MOUT.
Precision Eneagement. Precision Engagement (PE) applies more to higher intensity conflict, but has application at all levels of future MOUT. It will provide U.S. forces the capability to selectively neutralize threat targets in all conditions while minimizing collateral damage and fratricide. On the higher end of the spectrum, PE likely will be a dominant characteristic of warfare. By 2020, real-time responsiveness of sensor-to-shooter systems will become a reality. For the first time in history, this responsiveness will allow the striking force to maneuver fires rather than forces over long ranges, and allow direct and simultaneous attack on many of the enemy's centers of gravity.' Military Operations Concept on topographic Support for Terrain Visualization "Battlefield of the Future" pg. 3-10 At the lower end, PE will provide U.S. forces the capability to selectively apply force in the form of precision fire when required, with minimal risk of collateral damage. This surgical application of force will cause threat forces to frequently choose indirect offensive actions such as booby traps and snipers. Direct action in mass against U.S.
forces will be minimized based on the possession of these PE capabilities.
Use of Non-Lethal Weapons. In direct correlation to ROE/ROI is the employment of non-lethal weapons in support of MOUT. Non-lethal weapons provide all warriors and leaders additional flexibility in the application of force. This added capability is especially relevant in MOUT. The MOUT environment is unique in the fact that it often has both combatants and non-combatants mingled in such a way that normal lethal means of force is not the ideal tool to achieve mission success. Therefore, the MOUT environment requires additional tools to ensure mission success. Warriors and leaders using non-lethal technologies will have the capability to control crowds, restrict movement of persons and vehicles, and better administer use of force. To best control crowds and individuals, nonlethal tools are required, which provide the individual warrior or team with mounted and dismounted employment capabilities. Future non-lethal technologies will provide warriors and leaders with alternatives to enhance control of both individuals and crowds in all environments-whether mounted or dismounted.
Rules of Engagement (ROE) are designed to provide the Warrior and leaders a framework for the application of force. Specific military operations require unique ROE and can be modified as the situation warrants. Their intent to be used as a control measure can be successful as long as the ROE are written in a manner that fully support the mission objects, desired end state of the operation and the commander's intent.
The need for ROI stems from the condition that rules of engagement (ROE), in many instances, do not adequately address interaction between soldiers and other operational players (oint, multinational, and  interagency). The focus of ROE normally is towards the use offorce by military personneL Warriors engaged in the future MOUT environment must be familiar with the psychological as well as the physical environments likely to be encountered. Warriors' roles and actions in each of these environments must be detailed enough to address Warrior to player interactions supportive of the desired strategic end state. Rules of Interaction (ROI) predicated on interpersonal communication skills ()PC) fill this requirement and enhance the Warrior's persuasion, negotiation, and communications abilities.
Rules of Interaction, supportive of ROE, serve to increase a Warrior's survivability by reducing the likelihood of incidents escalating to lethal confrontations. Specific ROI, provide the soldier with a tool to address non-traditional threats such as political friction, ideologies, and culture- 
'
Future MOUT Warriors must focus on the entire conflict spectrum. Technoloy in Suport of Future MOUT Technological innovation and advancements continue to be a primary focus for many as a method to overcome the fiscal realities of likely future conditions. While technology can have a significant impact on warfare regardless of battlespace or environment, it is not a panacea and must be approached with some caution. Mere possession of superior technological capabilities does not automatically bring with it a parallel and embedded capacity to sustain the advantage. Also, the MOUT environment physically negates the effectiveness of some types of technology. 
The SACMFCS prototype demonstrated the improvement which can be realized in first burst probability of hit (Ph) with full solution fire control. At 600 meters, the MK19 GMG has a .15 Ph (15% chance) for first burst. On the other hand, the SACMFCS prototype in testing gave the user a .75 Ph (75% chance) for first burst hit. This equates to an improvement of fivefold in first burst Ph.
The primary purpose of individual and crew served weapons fire control efforts is to increase lethality and survivability of friendly forces. Precision fire control reduces the expertise required to engage and destroy threat targets. This is especially important considering the highly stressful conditions experienced on current and future battlefields.
To that end, the U.S. the GPS latitude and longitude very accurately, remotely via satellite And ifyou passed that information to an F-16 or an F-15 at 30,000 feet, and that pilot can simply put in that latitude and longitude into his bomb fire control system, then that bomb can be dropped quite accurately onto that target, maybe very close to that window, or, if it's a precision weapon, perhaps it could be put through the window.... I'd buy a lot of UA Vs in thefuture. 
Future UAV use will provide UAV systems to both tactical and operational level commanders.
This "layered" approach for UAV employment, which provides commanders access to UAV technology will a have significant impact on combat operations. Future MOUT will benefit from future UAV systems. The current approach for UAV employment fails to fully support future MOUT.
Highly mobile platforms, which can be used to deliver sensor packages, conduct crucial resupply and other MOUT related tasks are required. A possible solution to this deficiency is embodied in the Cypher program sponsored by Sikorsky. Cypher is not a
UAV, but rather an airborne delivery system.
The CWL is currently conducting extensive experimentation in the area of UAVs.
The X-Drone is the current UAV test platform for the CWL."fi This system is a low cost UAV that is not currently being pursued by any other service. Several other UAVs are under consideration by the CWL for future evaluation. The CWL is also interested in testing Kaman Aerospace's BURRO (broad-area unmanned retail resupply operations)
This system is designed to be an unmanned helicopter used for resupply. In this capacity, it would fill the earlier discussed role of Cypher. In either case, aerial resupply Affairs" will most likely make our Warriors capable in future MOUT. We must use and continue to develop technology to support the Warrior in future MOUT. We must not make the mistake of attempting to substitute technology as the prime instrument of success instead of the Warrior. Next, we must guard against over reliance on technology.
The threat will use this over reliance against us to great advantage. Furthermore, we must train and equip our Warriors with the capability to revert to manual means when technology fails them in combat. Murphy will always be with us. The truth of the matter is that when GPS fails, if one cannot read a map or conduct terrain association to navigate, the ongoing operation will suffer. Finally, while systems such as UAVs, cruise missiles and other PE technology will most likely be available in future MOUT, the conflict will be decided by the individual Warrior in the MOUT environment.
Many things exist which effect our opportunities for victory in future MOUT. Emerging technology, organizational design and doctrine, for example, are unique components of warfighting in all battlefield environments--including MOUT. This paper has attempted to show the value of using an integrated approach to achieve victory in the future MOUT environment. Following an analysis of the likely threat force and environment, this MOUT. Threat forces possessed many systems consistent with well-armed light infantry forces. These systems, while impressive, were not designed for decisive engagement with tank heavy forces. Threat forces were further strengthened because of their familiarity with that environment.
Future contingencies likely will be regional and in an urban setting. The scale, terrain, climate, indigenous culture, and character of the opposing forces will vary widely from case to case. The potential threats during this time will range from roving bands of insurgents through relatively well equipped regional forces to military powers. By 2020, regional conflicts may involve participants who threaten or use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The threat or actual use of weapons, hostage taking or attacks on civilians, may be used by adversaries to constrain U.S. responses and sway public opinion.
Urban warfare is the most likely environment for conflict and will increase in the future. The ongoing movement of rural populations drives this to urban areas.
A demographic upheaval of unprecedented proportions is today transforming almost the entire developing worldknown during the Cold War as the Third World-from predominately rural society to an urban one. For the first time, because of unimpeded population growth and a related shift from rural-based to urban-based societies, more people five in cities in the developing world than in cities in the industrialized world By the year 2020, the developing world will have accounted for 90% of the world's population growth since 1930. '" "Thus, the future killing grounds of the developing world will not be the impenetrable forests or remote mountain areas where guerrilla wars have traditionally been fought; rather, they will be the crowded, built-up areas in and around the less-developed world's burgeoning urban centers, whose residents will become inetricably enmeshed in insurgent-government conflict as rebels attempt to topple or replace existing governments.
Taw, pg. 1-2 N Taw, pg 7 fratricide and non-combatant casualties. Curfews, however, will not negatively affect Threat operations.
Future MOUT will require more dispersion by Threat forces in an attempt to minimize the likely Precision Engagement capability possessed by U.S. forces. Maneuver in the "urban canyon" will be most difficult for Threat forces. The Threat will use their indepth knowledge of familiar terrain, night operations and Own the Night (OTN)
technologies to be more effective in future MOUT.
Operations that might be considered defensive can be used in an offensive manner.
Mines will be employed not just to produce casualties or harass, but also to channel enemy forces into prepared kill zones. Anti-aircraft ambushes with Surface-to-Air (SAM) and snipers will force the enemy to restrict flight operations, fly higher, or commit escort aircraft to every operation. Threat forces because of their proven effectiveness in past MOUT operations will maximize snipers. Mature, highly skilled Threat snipers will provide a stealthy, highly effective and devastating offensive capability. For Threat operations, snipers provide leaders a superb economy-of-force tool. Snipers will aggressively eliminate key targets and personnel to damage the local government's credibility.
There will be a tendency to use "harmless" non-combatants to achieve military and political results such as happened with the U.S. involvement in Somalia. The Threat will use peaceful demonstrations and/or protests to cover moving their forces. This shield could be used to conduct combat operations and produce U.S. and host nation casualties.
The Threat will have a keen awareness of the applicable ROE, which govern U.S. force operations. Threat forces will use this knowledge in a direct attempt to use those personnel to cover the withdrawal of the main element. Personnel will expect to fight in isolation, a disadvantage overcome by thorough preparation (caches/log sites).
Intelligence will be an area of emphasis. Intelligence gathering in MOUT will depend primarily upon Human Intelligence (HUMINT) from supporters, infiltrators, translators, etc. Communications (conventional telephone and radio) intercept as well as computer exploitation will also be important sources of intelligence.
The Threat will possess the capability to make and deliver nuclear, biological and/or chemical munitions. There will be every attempt to be very specific in targeting (enemy troops, local ruling class). Collateral damage and damaging publicity situations will be avoided.
Psychological operations and media manipulation will be critical components of Threat doctrine. Media personnel will be carefully brought and protected when their "impartial" help is required and prevented from free movement as fits the needs of the Threat. The local government personnel and military will be specific high value targets for psychological operations as will the effort to alienate the local government and military from US forces.
Training/Leader Development. Training levels will greatly vary within the Threat. There likely will be three levels. The first and lowest level will occur within the supporters of the Threat. The second level will be seen among terrorist or militia type groups. The third and most proficient level will be among the Warrior class. In all cases, conducting actual operations will reinforce training. Training sites generally will be outside the city or outside the country and frequently funded by outside sources.
The supporters of the Threat will be poorly trained or trained in only specific areas (intel gathering and reporting, mine laying, limited booby trap preparation and emplacement). They may have very limited weapons training. This group likely will support the Threat through the civilian occupations of its members (truck drivers, doctors, and communications personnel).
Terrorist or militia personnel will be well trained in small unit (team, squad) tactics, techniques and procedures but poorly trained in platoon and company operations.
They will be proficient in the execution of small unit battle drills. Training in the use of small weapons (pistols, rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, hand-held anti-armor weapons) and special devices (night vision devices, hand-held SAMs, mines, booby traps, mortars) will be detailed. Snipers will be specially selected and trained in weapons and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Training on heavier equipment (armored vehicles, crew served air defense weapons, and artillery) will be limited. These personnel will also be well indoctrinated politically and/or religiously. Leaders will be somewhat better trained than the rank and file. This training will not provide a strong basis in platoon or above operations.
The third and most proficient group will be the Warrior class including both local nationals and foreign personnel. A current example of foreign personnel is the presence of radical Islamic Muslim Iranian Mujahaden in Bosnia attempting to exert and maintain Muslim influence in the region as a countermeasure to U.S. and other Western influences.
Future Threat forces will have received their training from conventional or special operations sources while in the military, or from other highly trained individuals. They will be proficient in individual weapons and TTPs through squad, platoon, company and sometimes battalion levels. An example of this class would be the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel who fought in Bosnia in the early 1990's. These Warriors trained (and indoctrinated) local volunteers, led local units, and/or integrated into local units.
Organizational Design. Threat forces will be organized along historical terrorist and guerrilla lines. The Threat generally will not mirror the downsizing trend caused by leaps in Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) and weapons effectiveness seen in Western armies. Operations security concerns will influence organizations. The command structure will be highly compartmentalized at middle and higher levels although the highest group may be highly public figures as was the case with General Dudayev (Chechnya) and Abimael Guzman (Sendero Luminoso, Peru). Organizations will vary among supporters, terrorists, guerrillas and the Warrior groups.
The supporters will be very loosely organized and will operate as individuals when called by their command structure. They will have a contingency organization for conventional operations consisting of squads, platoons, and companies.
Terrorists will be organized into small two-to-three-person cells at the lowest level. They will have the capability to combine cells into roughly squad size (7-12 personnel) elements and to operate in platoon size structures. These elements will have a common basis in training and experience but limited experience and capability in C3 at the platoon level. There will be no special weapons organizations.
Guerrilla type forces will be formally and more conventionally organized into infantry type squads, platoons, and companies. Special weapons squads and teams will exist within platoon, company, and battalion structures. These units will provide air defense (SAM and medium/heavy machine gun), anti-armor, and indirect fire (light/medium mortar) support. There may also exist (as in Chechnya) small teams or squads of armored vehicles as shock or counterattack forces. Guerrilla organizations will function fairly well up to and including the company level. At and above the battalion level, organizations will not function well due to limited training and experience.
The Warrior class also will have conventional organizations. Squads (10-12 personnel) and platoons (34-40 personnel) will be organized with a clear and effective chain of command. Due to the limited numbers of this group, they will rarely operate at or above company level. Company level operations will be similar in organization and effectiveness to Chechen operations conducted outside the republic.
There will be a national or umbrella type C4I structure. There will be one overall leader with between one and three trusted deputies. Removing the head of the organization will result in a decrease in combat operations and then a resurgence along previous lines (as seen with the Sendero Luminoso and the Chechen resistance). There will be a staff organized into administrative/personnel, operations, training, intelligence, logistics, psychological operations, and political/religious sections. This structure will be mirrored in the Threat organization in cities.
Technolov. As with all the Doctrine, Training, Leader Development, Organization, Materiel, and Soldiers (DTLOMS) there will be large variations in weapons within the Threat. Small arms range from derringers and pistols to light machine guns. These will include a large mixture of origins and calibers with the most sophisticated types being foreign produced and the largest quantities being the types, which the local government uses. There will be an emphasis on small, easily carried and concealed automatic weapons with high rates of fire. The most common caliber will be the local government forces (to enable resupply through raids, theft, etc.) carry. of U.S. force precision strike technology and to also capitalize on the Threat familiarization with its "home" terrain. Finally, Threat forces will use the media and an indepth understanding of U.S. force ROE to maximize their effectiveness. Other key concerns will be the "high tech" materiel pockets of Directed Energy Weapons and Weapons of Mass Destruction. Most dangerous will be the Warriors who fight by no particular rules, certainly the rules of its foe.

FM 90-10 has several significant omissions. First, it does not address operations short of war. Written while the cold war was in full swing. FM 90-10's writers never envisioned the end of the Soviet Union and the subsequent involvement of the Army in numerous MOUT other than war. Second. FM 90-10 does not consider the range of terrain the Army currently faces. Its narrow scope only treats the European environment and fails to consider any other types of terrain or built-up areas. Finally, it does not address the technology available to today's Army. Specifically. the manual does not treat the use of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. guided munitions. navigation, and communication equipment, and non-lethal weapons. In summary. FM 90-10 established MOUT doctrine for the cold war Army. It describes urban combat in a European environment, with the Soviet Union in a high intensity conflict. Its doctrine advocates offensive operations only when absolutely necessary,. using a combined arms team. It describes defensive doctrine in more detail than its predecessor, but does not offer much in defensive doctrine unique to MOUT.

If this study finds that the doctrine is adequate, doctrine writers can solve more pertinent and relevant problems. If current MOUT doctrine is inadequate, this study will identify those inadequacies and make recommendations on the changes required to bring Army MOUT doctrine up to date. This thesis can significantly contribute to preparing the Army for current and future operations in urbanized terrain.

All three monographs are timely and examine MOUT from a current perspective. All three recommend that the Army stop avoiding MOUT and embrace the idea that MOUT is a fact of conducting most future operations. Given the idea that MOUT is an inevitability in future operations. each monograph makes specific conclusions relating to changing how the Army conducts MOUT. Each monograph makes interesting recommendations. but all are deficient in the depth of their recommendations. Specifically. none make recommendations on how to change MOUT in relations to the use of technology, different threats, or in operations short of war.
"MOUT Art Operational Planning Considerations for MOUT" by Major Charles A. Preysler, outlines several key points. First, the Army must accept urban combat in the future as inevitable and plan accordingly. Second, in planning, leaders must understand the urban environment and the tension created between destruction.
cost. and duration. Third, planners must focus on operational objectives in order to ensure timely success.. Fourth and finally, he determines that current MOUT doctrine is insufficient and inadequate because of its age. He recommends a full revision of FM 90-10 "to brine it in line with current U.S. doctrine." Major Preysler's recommendations focus on adding operational planning considerations to MOUT doctrine, including differing terrain, threat, and leveraging modern technology in warfare. 4
Major Richard M. Francey, Jr., wrote "The Urban Anatomy: The Fundamentals of a City." Major Francey contends that current MOUT doctrine is not adequate for future operations based on two main reasons. The first reason is that the doctrine's focus in incorrect. The Army's MOUT doctrine, as found in FM 90-10 is too tactically oriented and the Army should revise it to give it a more operational focus. Major required to maintain the strengths of the current doctrine, while correcting the problems with Army MOUT doctrine. The historical case studies may be used to derive lessons learned from various MOUT operations, covering a range of missions, threats, terrain, and use of technology.
Many options are available in selecting analytical tools to evaluate Army doctrine. This study will evaluate Army MOUT doctrine using a variation of the soldiers' METT-T analysis. That variation includes the use of mission, threat, terrain, and technology as categories. The study will also evaluate two recent MOUT cases against the mission, threat, terrain, and technology model. The resulting analysis will allow the researcher to draw conclusions and then make recommendations relating to current MOUT doctrine. Though there are potential weaknesses associated with using this type of analytical analysis, the weaknesses do not threaten the integrity or validity of the analysis.

Military Operations Other than War (MOOTW) -Encompasses the use of military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war. These military actions can be applied to complement any combination of the other instruments of national power and occur before, during, and after war. Also called MOOTW.

Precision Engagement (PE) -Precision engagement will consist of a system of systems that enables joint forces to locate the objective or target, provide responsive command and control, generate the desired effect, assess the level of success, and retain the flexibility to reengage with precision when required. 4
Precision MOUT -Conventional forces conduct these operations to defeat an enemy that is mixed with noncombatants. They conduct these operations carefully to limit noncombatant casualties and collateral damage. 5
Rapid Force Projection Initiative -DBBL initiative using an architecture of Hunters and Killer systems which work together to form the ground based Precision Engagement (PE) network.
Rules of Engagement (ROE) -Directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which U.S. forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other encountered forces. ROE is often an important consideration in MOOTW, but applies across the entire range of military operations. 6
Sea Dragon -The Sea Dragon Concept is the USMC's vision of warfighting in the 21st Century. Sea Dragon is a naval expeditionary concept applicable across the spectrum of conflict and in all warfare environments.

An integrated approach to MOUT is required in order to achieve victory in the future. This integrated approach states that through an examination and focus in the areas Efforts, such as Army Force XXI and Sea Dragon, will address future organizational changes. These efforts will examine the proposed threat, new battlefield systems, and other considerations to identify the optimal base force(s) required. In the end, the task force commander's primary method of ensuring organizational and mission success in future MOUT will be through effective force tailoring.
The "Force Suitability Principle (FSP)" is a tool available to the military planner and leader when considering force tailoring for future MOUT. The essence of this principle recognizes that units should be chosen/tailored to meet a threat based upon an assessment of that unit's capability (predicated upon how that unit trains, operates and thinks) and the unit's political acceptability (predicated on the unit's force signature, the expectations of the international community, and the perceptions of the US populace). 
The FSP provides a method to better evaluate units for their relative merits as part of a future MOUT force.
The Warrior in future MOUT will have unique requirements. The graphic below focuses on several key areas of concern. These areas will be discussed Objective Crew Served Weapon (OCSW). The OCSW system is designed to replace both the M2 .50 cal Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) and the MK19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG). The current system as proposed uses a 25mm high explosive air bursting munitions. Extensive use of lightweight/high strength materials and optoelectric full solution fire control are ideally suited to the requirements of ground forces in the 21st
Century especially the MOUT environment. Inherent ammunition characteristics of OCSW reveal this system's ammunition fires munitions with a much flatter trajectory at comparable ranges. The net effect is a significant improvement in engaging moving targets.
Below is graphic representation of this system:
The OCSW system will add significant combat capability to those operating in the MOUT environment for several reasons. First, as was previously addressed, the use of full solution fire control will minimize both collateral damage and ammunition consumption.
Successful mastery of these two key battlefield considerations will ensure maximum effort is devoted toward defeating the threat versus sustaining the friendly effort. Second, OCSW
Below is a current version of the above mentioned warrior computer undergoing fieldtesting:
While this proposed system enhances acquiring and processing information, it also creates problems in dissemination and focusing that information for those best capable to act upon it.
Combat Identification (Combat ID) -Combat ID is critical to the success of future MOUT for several reasons. First, the American public opinion strongly supports any materiel technology efforts which will reduce or eliminate fratricide on the battlefield.
Desert Storm and its intense coverage by the media was a revelation to the average American.. During Desert Storm, fratricide was a critical concern of U.S. ground troops.
Many still believe that through the use of PGM and "smart munitions" U.S. forces have the capability to place lethality when and where we choose. Many also believe that we have the capability to apply technology to the individual warrior so that the risk of fratricide is significantly diminished. Second, the key difference between the MOUT environment and Below is the current operational prototype of Cypher: Doctrine. The immediate objective of Threat forces will be to assist a national effort to discredit the host nation's government and separate it from the US. Identifiable doctrine will vary based on many factors. Doctrine will also vary between and within identifiable groups, and will evolve as the U.S. operation continues. Threat forces will recognize that they cannot attack superior U.S. forces on an equal basis. There will be no doctrine that readily lends itself to association with any particular nation or military. Doctrine will be a product of prior military training, national characteristics, social mores, and of resident or "volunteer" Warrior groups.
Threat force doctrine will stress seizing the initiative to pursue Threat objectives emphasizing the greatest number of enemy casualties with the greatest amount of media coverage (at selected places and times). The Threat will concentrate its operations from the "slumburbs" where the greatest support is likely to be found. The residential areas of the very wealthy will be high target areas this was demonstrated in the last FMLN offensive in San Salvador. Such targets will severely constrain the capability of U.S. forces to use their greatest advantage of air power and indirect fire. When possible the Threat will conduct special operations outside the built-up area including over international borders (Example: Chechen delivery of nuclear material into a Moscow park; Chechen taking of hostages outside Chechnya).
The Threat will attempt to use information warfare as a primary tool against U.S.
forces. With a notebook computer, a 'Techno-Warrior" who penetrates our "tactical
Internet" will possess great potential to negatively effect U.S. force operations. As U.S.
forces increase their reliance on digitization and C2, Threat forces will increase their efforts to use this reliance against U.S. forces. Threat forces will attempt to recruit Techno-Warriors in support of offensive operations. Techno-Warriors can operate in relative safety providing an economy of force t similar to a sniper.
Ambushes and raids will be common, generally in squad to platoon size elements.
Targets will be undefended or lightly defended local government or military targets. As in the past, Threat efforts most likely will be against rear area targets, which are often in built-up or urban areas. Rear area targets are often less guarded than are other targets.
The most common rear area targets are U.S. force and Host Nation logistics centers, which offer low cost and high payoff in materiel and psychological impact. Furthermore, such attacks against U.S. forces dependent on supply and maintenance will demand a commitment of combat troops to guard these sites. This increases the cost for U. S.
forces and commits combat troops into fixed sites that can be isolated and destroyed. It establishes a long-term tendency to retake the initiative from a superior enemy force.
Small-unit night operations will be common. Threat units will attempt to maximize effectiveness through the use of sophisticated, man portable, night imagery systems. The Threat will adapt, as it learns what operations work and which do not. For example, the Threat will use command-detonated mines. When U.S. forces begin to use engineers to sweep, the Threat will ambush the personnel. When U.S. forces send reaction forces, they will be damaged or destroyed as in Mogadishu. Threat forces will attempt to get between U.S. forces and encourage fratricidal firefights. For example, in January 1995, there was a firefight between a Russian tank and a Russian motorized rifle unit, which lasted for six hours before the Russian units, could identify each other and establish a cease-fire.
Defensive. Threat forces will use the defense while in transition to offensive operations.
The goal of the defense is to protect logistics/caches, inflict casualties, and embarrass the enemy government(s) through showing their impotence. The Threat will defend high value areas and likely will also defend from highly populated areas to limit any enemy's unrestricted use of artillery or aerial-delivered ordnance. While a large area defense such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) conducted in Grozny, Simon and Beirut will be less common it represents the high end of the conflict spectrum. Generally, the Threat will defend well-selected areas for limited time periods to accomplish limited objectives.
The Threat will defend according to a detailed plan of action. Selected buildings and areas will be strongpointed and organized for a 360-degree defense (also including aerial and subsurface considerations). The Threat will use all floors of the building and prepare routes of communication and escape by making holes in interior walls and digging shallow communications ditches in open areas. They will use tunnels and sewers for movement as well as for important nodes (command posts, logistics sites, and hospitals).
They will also use "off limits" sites (historic buildings, hospitals, orphanages, churches, etc.) for critical facilities knowing that the cost to the enemy of destroying these areas would be very damaging in the eyes of the world.
As was previously discussed in the offense, snipers will be key personnel in defensive operations. There will be two types of snipers. The first will be above average marksmen with no special equipment. The second will be above average marksmen or specially trained personnel who will have special rifles (hunting or sniper) with day and sometimes night-capable optics. They will target any personnel identifiable as leaders and key vehicle crewmen (commanders, drivers). Snipers with anti-material weapons will damage or destroy all robotic type vehicles realizing that these ground or aerial devices represent key reconnaissance assets.
Threat operations will seek to separate attacking combat vehicles from their accompanying infantry. They will use light and portable anti-armor ambushes to attrit the enemy whenever possible. They will carefully recon firing positions to ensure that minimum arming range restrictions will not hamper operations. They will integrate mines and barricades into the overall defensive plan to attrit, slow, divert, and separate enemy elements. Operations such as these were responsible for destroying 112 of 120 combat vehicles of the Russian 131st Motorized Rifle Brigade in January 1995 while engaged in operations in Grozny, Chechnya.
Local counterattacks and ambushes will be common, as will night operations.
When the Threat is forced to abandon positions, it will generally leave one or more Medium weapons will range from medium machine guns through anti-armor weapons. The most common types will be those carried by the local government forces.
Anti-armor weapons may be an exception if the Threat is supported by extra-national powers (Nicaragua's support of the FMLN in El Salvador). These could be soft launch, fire and forget weapons designed to defeat the best armor in the world.
Indirect fire weapons will range from home made catapult (FMLN type) explosive launchers through mortars and possibly local government artillery and MRIL systems.
Smart, terminally guided mortar rounds will be available in sufficient quantities to attack high value enemy targets. Both radio type proximity fuse rounds and "dumb" rounds to combat radio frequency weaponsjammers will be available. Incendiary munitions also will be used against specific targets.
Demolitions, explosives and mines will include everything from late 20th century versions to the most modem available on the world market. In an environment where the enemy will have tremendous technological advantages, old and unsophisticated devices such as simple booby-traps may have great value. 20th century type hand grenades will continue to be critical and heavily used devices.
There will be a variety of special weapons or specially modified weapons. These may include weapons with no flash and no acoustic launch signatures. Surface-to-Air
Missile systems likely will have multiple proximity type warheads of greatly increased power. Threat forces will possess limited quantities of very sophisticated night vision/thermal type target acquisition sights. Laser/red dot devices will be common for small arms. Sniper rifles will range from conventional calibers into heavy anti-materiel calibers with munitions designed to penetrate targets and explode inside.
The Threat will use the entire spectrum of communications from couriers (memorized, or written and encoded messages) to sophisticated frequency hopping radios.
Local telephones will be heavily used. The 2020 version of the Internet will be used to communicate outside the city and country as needed. Encryption will be manual and sophisticated.
Threat forces at all levels of organization will be capable of delivering NBC munitions. Nuclear material contamination will be most common although the Threat may use very small, very low yield nuclear devices against high priority targets (bridges, enemy C41 sites). Biological weapons will be race/ethnicity specific when possible (i.e. targeted against foreign/US personnel or the ruling ethnic group). Chemical incapacitants will be the most commonly used, mainly to disable enemy troops in non-lethal ways.
Directed Energy Weapons will include limited quantities of laser blinding devices and very small quantities of "hard kill" laser weapons. Crude acoustic weapons will be available in very limited quantities based on limited utility in MOUT environments.
The MOUT Threat will be dangerous, unpredictable and greatly varied in its training, material, and organization. Threat forces will use whatever means at their disposal to meet their objectives. Future Threat "enablers "to meet Threat objectives will be different from those of today. Threat forces will focus on low tech Information Warfare (W) capabilities to take advantage on U.S. force heavy dependence on digitization. The Threat will actively recruit "techno-Warriors" to attack U.S. force digitization capabilities. Threat tactics will change to maximize the use of snipers in both offensive and defensive operations. Threat tactics will also emphasize the use of small unit operations during night and times of limited visibility. This will minimize the effectiveness Vietnam, where the communist opposition of insurgency. The role of active military forces generally followed a Maoist pattern of in countering these potential threats to internal revolution. Many of the new insurgencies, security is discussed as well as the adequacy of however, may be "Islamic Fundamentalist" in public law and military doctrine. Social, character.
