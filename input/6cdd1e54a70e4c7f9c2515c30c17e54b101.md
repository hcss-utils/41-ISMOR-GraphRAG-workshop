Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the concurrent end to the Cold War, the US and most of the international community hoped that Russia would eventually become an open, democratic, and non-threatening nation.
This is reflected in the massive US troop withdrawal from Europe, from 300,000 down to 30,000.
The point of this paper is not to criticize this hope, nor the action of the large draw-down of forces; rather, it is to shed light on the reality that Russia does not share the same desire as the West in this regard.
The facts are that under Vladimir Putin's leadership Russia has steadily sought to strengthen is military, demonstrated in the strikingly swift and broad reaching military reforms that began in 2008.
Further evidence of Putin's intent starts that same year, in 2008, when he sent tanks, troops, and aircraft into the sovereign country of Georgia.
This event was an indicator of future events to come in Crimea and Ukraine.
