The guerrilla's usual battle plan is to avoid direct engagements with enemy units with superior firepower.
Instead, guerrillas rely on hit-and-run attacks, booby-traps, car bombs, and the like, trying to inflict over time an unacceptable level of casualties on the enemy to compel withdrawal.
This happened rapidly to the United States in Somalia, thanks to the "CNN effect," and more slowly to the Russians during their 1994-96 occupation of Chechnya since Russia had no CNN to bring the war home to its citizens.
The RMA does not appear to provide new ways of driving guerrillas from urban areas, so it would appear that ground troops would still be needed.
The military's heavy weapons are generally ill-suited to urban conflict and often vulnerable to attack from above from buildings fronting on streets.
