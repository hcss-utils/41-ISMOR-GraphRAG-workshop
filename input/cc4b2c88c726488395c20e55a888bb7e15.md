Some scholars find Russia's success in Ukraine as an evolution of Russian strategic thought that successfully weaves together military and nonmilitary methods to achieve its geopolitical goals.
Kristin Ven Bruusgaard attributes Russia's operations in Ukraine to a shift in Russian strategic thought versus an evolution in Russian military doctrine.
Ven Bruusgaard believes that the Russian military borrowed tactics from the West "for nurturing regime change by using political, economic, or military support to selected groups, covert action and information operations."
