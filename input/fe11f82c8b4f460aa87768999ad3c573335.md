The current United States Army's PME system includes the study of past wars to improve future preparation for various possible future contingencies requiring the use of military force.
However, the bulk of the instruction covers European military history, specifically that of Prussia and Germany.
American military history might not offer an image of immense professionalism and panache like that seen in the tradition of centuries-old fighting cultures.
However, American military history does depict a pragmatic use of operational art that befits both the nation's and the Army's culture and fighting style.
One can see this in the American planning and execution of Operations Torch and Cobra.
Therefore, the third and final recommendation for the future of officer PME rests on the premise of an increased emphasis in the study of American military history.
Doing this enables students to achieve a greater appreciation and pride for the history of their nation and chosen profession, while developing a greater understanding of American operational art.
