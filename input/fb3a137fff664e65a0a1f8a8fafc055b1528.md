With the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Great Britain recognised the independence of the United States.
However, both sides found it difficult to shake loose from each other.
Many British, and indeed Europeans, doubted that a republic would have the internal strength to survive, and many expected that, sooner or later, the new country would fall apart, allowing Britain and others, such as Spain, France, and Russia, to pick up some of the pieces (this expectation was nearly fulfilled, although it would take eighty years and the Civil War for it to be tested and found to be wrong).
For their part, many Americans expected to continue to enjoy the economic and especially trading privileges that they had enjoyed as part of the empire, even though they had rejected it.
The British for their part were incredulous at the American expectation that commercial life could go on as before the separation.
