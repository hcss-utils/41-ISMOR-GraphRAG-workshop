Military systems are disadvantaged because military radios are constrained in capability due to the requirement to be portable (size and weight considerations), utilize omni-directional antennas, and be able to operate in austere areas without civilian communication infrastructure.
To make more room within the EMS the military divides each frequency into quarters to deconflict radio traffic between echelons and increase the number of radios able to operate.
The bottom line is a limit exists where the EMS physically cannot support that number of radios, regardless if the military is frequency hopping or not.
The Army's research and development efforts are ongoing to create new waveforms and algorithms designed to operate within a contested EMS.
Concerning our main potential adversaries of Russia and China, electronic warfare represents a vital interest with both investing in modernizing electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt or disintegrate American command and control capabilities.
The multiple US conflicts the past decades provided both Russia and China an invaluable opportunity as an outside observer to learn the US strengths and identify capability gaps which to exploit.
In response, both Russia and
