In 1950, as a response to the shocks of the Russian atomic bomb and the Chinese communist revolution, Washington chose to intervene in a civil war in Korea to prevent a takeover by native communists.
From that moment on, the world over, the US and communists remained locked in mortal struggle, ensnaring many who wished to take neither side.
Though the US never dared to attack Russia after it acquired the means to retaliate with nuclear weapons, the 'cold' confl ict took the form of many hot wars by proxy in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, East Timor, Afghanistan, Central America, the horn of Africa, Angola and Mozambique.
Beyond these horrifi c wars, numerous other covert interventions, coups, assassinations and other crimes resulted in a death toll approaching the losses of World War II itself and the majority of casualties were civilians.
These wars and forays sometimes were sanctioned by the United Nations but most constituted violations of the very international law to which the US and Soviets had pledged their support in order to avert the atrocity of war.
None was declared by the Congress of the United States as prescribed by the US Constitution.
And in every one the US public was whipsawed by lies and deceptions into initial support.
