Like China, Russia also had a highly successful strategy for empire.
Russian peasants fled their enserfers and spread out in search of new land on the frontiers.
Fortune seekers 13-5   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order also gravitated toward the frontiers.
Farmers soon sought government help to defend their new lands against marauders.
Nearby military commands tended to provide help.
Civil officials followed.
If the local Russian population and skeletal administration could take and retain territory on the cheap, the Russian government recognized their actions.
If they could not, the Russian government disavowed them (a scenario that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have been trying to replay in 2014 vis-Ã -vis Ukraine).
