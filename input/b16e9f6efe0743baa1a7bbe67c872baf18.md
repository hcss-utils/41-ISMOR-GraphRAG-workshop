To address these developments in Russian capabilities, our analysis offers insight across the range of capability areas outlined.
For the maneuver ground forces, the Army should prepare for challenges from the overall size of the Russian forces and modernized Soviet-era platforms.
To address the challenge posed by Russia's indirect fire and long-range strike capabilities to U.S. forces at all echelons of the battlefield, the U.S. Army should investigate options to attrite Russian systems; to pursue dispersal, denial, and deception; and to improve EW and air and missile defenses.
Improving U.S. cyber and EW capability at the tactical and operational level could help address Russia's growing parity in C4ISR, although this may require investment in command, control, and planning, as well as possible changes in authorities to use cyber.
The U.S. military should also continue to pursue options to bolster communications, positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) against Russia's EW, and Multi-Domain Battle and related concepts to address Russia's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities.
