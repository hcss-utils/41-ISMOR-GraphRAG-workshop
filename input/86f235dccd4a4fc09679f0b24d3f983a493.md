In the first case, it seems that Russia focused mainly on creating a conflict in Estonia, but there was no follow-up plan on how to proceed after its start.
Therefore, it can be said that Russia used the favorable opportunity to test its ability to use non-state actors against the state in NATO and the EU.
In addition, as Chapter II describes Russia's goals to use every possibility to weaken the West, there was a potential opportunity for Moscow to exhaust its opponent in Russia's "near abroad" and also fragment European unity.
In the case of Montenegro, Russia managed to pave the way for a successful NTW campaign under the conditions set out in the central proposal of the thesis.
Unlike the case in Estonia, there was also a follow-up plan to achieve the goal with non-state actors and prevent Montenegro from joining NATO or at least postponing the process.
The failure was caused by a weak link in the plan, without which it is possible that the coup attempt in Montenegro could have succeeded.
