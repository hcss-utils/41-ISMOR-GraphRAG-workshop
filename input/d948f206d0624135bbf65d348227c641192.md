The Russian Far East and the Central Military District border along North Korea, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan are currently either loosely allied or do not pose a viable threat to the Russian Federation at this time.
The regions along the western border and the Southern Military District or the Caucasus region do not generate viable options for Russia as they seek expansion opportunities that are limited, attainable, and risk less international involvement.
