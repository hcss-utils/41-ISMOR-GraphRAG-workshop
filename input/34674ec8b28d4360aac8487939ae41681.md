# Fulltext:
Since the Soviet era, the Russian military has not had the physical capability to execute Tukhachevskii's theories of Deep Battle and Deep Operations, nor has the geopolitical climate fostered conditions to do so in pursuit of Russian national interests.
Instead, Russia engaged in wars with limited aims and means in Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine beginning in 2014.
The Soviet doctrine of Deep Operations of annihilation strives to physically destroy the adversary.
Today, the Russian theory of Deep Operations seeks to achieve success with a more significant informational component in a strategy of limited action in New Type Warfare.
Leveraging the information environment allows Russia to compensate for its lack of military capacity for sustained large-scale combat against Western powers by integrated military and non-military means in a whole-of-nation approach.
Russia seeks seams in the relationships of the international system and exploits opportunities to employ limited military means successfully by achieving operational surprise, maintaining the initiative with its operational tempo, and by massing physical and cognitive effects throughout the depth of the tactical, operational, and strategic areas.
