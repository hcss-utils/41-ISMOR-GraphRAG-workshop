In modern Russian theory of warfare, the required operational effects and ends are the same, but the ways and means are significantly different, due to technological advancement and the current constraints of the geopolitical climate.
Additionally, Russia's strategic approach changed drastically since the Soviet era.
Throughout the 20th century, Russia and the Soviet Union adhered to a direct, offensive strategy, whereas Russia presently uses an aggressive, predominantly indirect, and less overt strategy, with Georgia, Crimea, and the Donbas as exceptions.
