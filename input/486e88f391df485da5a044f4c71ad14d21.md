The year 2014 was an eventful one for the Russian military, opening with the seizure of Crimea, continuing through ongoing operations in and near Ukraine, and culminating with the issue of a new Military Doctrine reflecting what Russia describes as new security realities in Europe.
All of these circumstances have drawn attention back to the challenge to U.S. interests posed by the Russian military.
The issue of this Paper is therefore especially timely.
