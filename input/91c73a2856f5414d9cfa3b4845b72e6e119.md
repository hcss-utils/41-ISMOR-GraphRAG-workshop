Russia learned though urban combat in Chechnya and Georgia and broad fronts in Ukraine, that it can no longer depend solely on the skills of its officers.
In 2000, a major difference between U.S. artillery and Soviet/Russian artillery is the responsibility of the battery commander.
The battery commander in the Soviet/Russian artillery is much more centralized, located at the observation post to observe targets, help with computations, and keeps in contact with the maneuver forces.
