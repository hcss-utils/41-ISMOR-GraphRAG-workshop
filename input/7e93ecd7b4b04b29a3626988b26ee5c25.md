The research for this report was conducted prior to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which unfolded shortly after this report was written.
Therefore, this report does not examine the role of the General Staff in the ongoing campaign.
But we would be remiss in discussing the progress of the Russian Armed Forces as an institution without also acknowledging the initial observations of the press and analytical community regarding the stumbles that Russia's military took in its first weeks of its incursion into Ukraine.
Thus far, the Russian military has encountered numerous challenges-stemming from logistical, morale, and command and control (C2), and capability issues-in its operation in Urkaine.
