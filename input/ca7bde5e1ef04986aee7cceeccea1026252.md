Recent experience and the predisposition of current policymakers indicate that deliberate regime change is a low-probability future demand.
For example, one is hard-pressed to see regime change or forcible democratization as objectives in any future conflict with rising great powers like China or Russia.
In the event of a future great power conflict, prospective land force contributions would support coercive/punitive operations centered on air and naval actions.
They may also be employed in pursuit of limited objectives on the periphery of the offending state to reverse limited incursions or seize key terrain.
Likewise, the now obvious costs of a deliberate regime change and forcible democratization make it hard to visualize the United States adopting either objective in a future conventional conflict with lesser regional powers.
As Secretary Gates recently emphasized, "The United States is unlikely to repeat another Iraq or Afghanistan-that is, forced regime change followed by nation building under fire-anytime soon."
