# Title: Protecting the status quo: the defense against a Russian color revolution
# Database: Google Scholar
# Year: 2017.0
# Fulltext:
Further research should look at how Russia's understanding of color revolutions has influenced its non-military efforts in Europe and the Unites States.
Additionally, future research should look at what Western countries can learn from Russia's defensive efforts, using that knowledge to strengthen their own defenses against Russian influence in their society, politics, and elections.
Such understanding will be essential if Russia ever tries to create its own color revolution.
