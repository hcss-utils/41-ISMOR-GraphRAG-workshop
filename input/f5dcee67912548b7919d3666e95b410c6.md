Russia's operations in Eastern Europe and its Near Abroad since 2008 signal an evolving approach to the contemporary conduct of war.
Speaking on the specter of Russian hybrid operations in Eastern Europe, Lt.
Gen. Michael Williamson commented, "In terms of state-based challenges, Russia's purported annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine demonstrated a sophisticated combination of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic means to achieve objectives below a threshold that the Russian leadership believe would elicit a concerted NATO response."
3 Russia's contemporary approach to war is characterized by the use of information, unconventional forces, conventional forces, cyber operations, electronic operations, and partisan forces to achieve military objectives aligned with political aims.
Russia's actions have gone beyond the exclusive use of military force and have steadily increased the employment of the other instruments of national power in the pursuit of political objectives, thus shrinking the distance between the strategic and tactical levels of war.
Furthermore, Russia's actions indicate a temporal component which seeks to operate within the international community's reaction time.
