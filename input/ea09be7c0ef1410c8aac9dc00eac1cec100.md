In 2014 Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory, taking control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after a referendum in which Russia claims Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation.
Eastern Ukraine is still gripped in armed conflict between Ukrainian Government Forces and those backed by Russia.
Russia successfully blended conventional military tactics and capabilities with non-military means and ways to successfully annex the Crimean Peninsula and control key areas of Eastern Ukraine, highlighting the distinct aspects that challenge our current definitions and understanding of hybrid threat.
