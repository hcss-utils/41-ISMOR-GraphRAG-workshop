1 General Valery Gerasimov, Russian Chief of the General Staff is widely considered as the primary champion of non-linear warfare.
In an article published in 2013 he describes methods for a nation to impose its will through a combination of military and non-military means.
Effective methods include "…the broad use of political, economic, informational, humanitarian, and other nonmilitary measures…" Russia's non-linear warfare in Crimea and Ukraine employed unmarked, undeclared forces.
Non-linear warfare is described in a later section of this work.
