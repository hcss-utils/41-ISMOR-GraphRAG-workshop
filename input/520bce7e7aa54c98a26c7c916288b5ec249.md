Concurrently, the Syrian opposition, led by Tahrir al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra Front), was engaged in a counteroffensive against SAA ground forces in Hama.
Early battlefield successes by opposition forces were quickly reversed in April, with the regime emerging the clear victor.
The surge of Russian airstrikes in the Idlib de-escalation zone in September, however, prompted Tahrir al-Sham to resume its Hama offensive.
The SAA used Russian air support to stem the opposition's push, but the outcome was inconclusive based on changes in territorial control.
The Hama conflict continued in a stalemate through the end of 2017, with modest Russian air cover in Hama and Idlib.
