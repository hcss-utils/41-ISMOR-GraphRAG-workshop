# Database: Google Scholar

# Fulltext:
Amidst the confluence of cultures brought about by modernization, nations and societies have accelerated secularization efforts as a response to increasing plurality. The militaries that serve these nations are no exception. However, the soldiers of these military forces reflect the wider society in terms of exercising their religious beliefs. Inadvertently, in their attempt to adhere to the secularity of the prevailing governments, secular militaries could overlook the religious needs of their soldiers. The danger of such a scenario is the potential erosion of individual soldiers' will to fight, leading to reduced combat effectiveness overall. In its study Will to Fight: Returning to the Human Fundamentals of War, the RAND Corporation defined will to fight as an essential human factor in war, and identified religion as an important sub-component of it. Thus, the problem facing secular militaries is the challenge of fostering religious practice while remaining secular and pluralistic. To address this problem, this research set out to identify the means through which secular militaries can foster religious practice within the ranks. A case study analysis was performed on four secular militaries -the Indian Army, the Israel Defense Forces, the US Army, and the Soviet Army -to distill relevant insights from their experiences in creating an enabling religious environment. This research found that religion has a positive impact on will to fight, and that secular militaries can employ organizational, leadership, and policy instruments to harness the positive relationship between religion and will to fight to improve their combat effectiveness.
Chaplains are not in the Army because government is primarily interested in the saving of men's souls. The chaplain shares the mission of all other arms of the service to strengthen the will to victory â€¦ Religion can and does make souls strong for battle. [emphasis added] -Roger R. Venzke, Confidence in Battle, Inspiration in Peace
In the late nineteenth century, Friedrich Nietzsche asserted that "God is dead," allegedly prophesying the inevitable decline of religion as a result of the Enlightenment.

This phenomenon is true even in modernized, secular states. America is witnessing a rise in evangelical Protestantism particularly in the south; Singapore, a highly diverse city-state known for its pragmatic sensitivity towards matters of religion (and also where the author of this thesis hails from), recently revised its policy concerning the donning of religious attire by civil servants, and acquiesced to the wishes of the minority Muslim community to allow nurses to wear the tudung, known in Arabic as the hijab.

These contrasting trends point to a deeper tension between the ruling elite and the masses. Peter Berger, the preeminent proponent of secularization theory in the field of sociology, described the potential dissatisfaction and disenchantment that could arise if secular governments failed to address the religious needs of the people.

the tudung affirmed that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) would maintain the status quo of not allowing the tudung to be worn, on the basis that the SAF is one of the "impartial and secular arms of the State who are armed and enforce laws." 10 Thanks to these reasons, secular militaries often overlook the importance of religion in the ranks. This researcher argues that militaries overlook the importance of religion at their peril. The scope of analysis of religion's impact goes beyond the concern over potential dissatisfaction and insubordination of soldiers. Its central thesis is that secularization affects militaries in the very core of its mission: its ability to wage war. Based on the RAND Corporation's recent study Will to Fight: Returning to the Human Fundamentals of War, the religious affiliation of soldiers is an important component of their will to fight.

At the same time, recent trends among the populace of many nations indicate a religious resurgence, repudiating the theory that modernity brings about complete secularization. The result is that many nations have public institutions that are thoroughly secular while attempting to govern societies that remain deeply religious. The militaries that serve these nations are no exception, and while their structures are secular, the soldiers who comprise the military forces are a microcosm of the wider society in terms of exercising their religious beliefs. This leads to a divide between the soldiers that defend the societies, and their governments. The danger of such a divide is that militaries will overlook the religious needs of their soldiers in the attempt to adhere to the secularity of the prevailing governments. As religion forms an important component of the will to fight, the problem facing these militaries is a potential erosion of individual soldiers' will to fight leading to reduced combat effectiveness overall.

Such an effort is significant because of the untapped potential it contains.
Academics and military leaders alike recognize that there is insufficient understanding of the role of religion in conflicts. If this blindness occurs in understanding one's adversary, even more so could it occur in understanding one's own strengths. Furthermore, in an increasingly contested geopolitical environment, militaries that need to mobilize large masses of soldiers to potentially engage in large-scale combat operations will need to galvanize and unify citizen soldiers. Understanding how religion can play a part in fostering cohesiveness and morale can help commanders employ it as a force multiplier, especially when facing a peer adversary that does not have the same climate of encouraging religious observance. Despite such promise, so little is said about this topic.
Hence, the researcher hopes to shed light on an oft-avoided topic, and lay the groundwork for future research. The next section outlines the primary and secondary research questions that help to achieve this end.
To "operationalize" the importance of religion, this thesis aims to answer the primary research question of, "How can secular militaries harness the relationship between the religion of individual soldiers and will to fight as a force multiplier to improve combat effectiveness?" To answer this primary research question requires exploration of three attendant areas of study detailed in the secondary research questions (SRQs) below.
First, the lack of clarity regarding the link between religion and the will to fight often discolors military policymakers' and leaders' views to the role of religion. This ignorance is exacerbated by the prevailing environments of secular militaries that foster an easier rationalization of how matters of religion should be relegated to the realm of private matters. In order to combat such a stance, this thesis must first establish a link between religion and the will to fight. Therefore, a secondary research question is: What is the relationship between will to fight and the practice of religion in the ranks? Second, militaries comprise essential organs of state, and are thus influenced and structured by the ruling government. Secular militaries are deliberately so by design of political masters, the founding documents of a country and the underlying assumptions of the culture about separation of church and state. At the same time, religion has the potential to motivate soldiers and units to have a greater will to fight. This leads to another secondary research question: What conditions can secular militaries set to foster the practice of religion while remaining secular? Third, secular militaries often remain secular in order to manage the religious diversity among the ranks. Given how religions can differ so greatly in their beliefs and requirements, militaries face the challenge of accommodating the authentic practice of each religion while avoiding instances of exclusively promoting one particular religion or practice. Hence, the challenge of accommodating the religious needs of all members of the military rather than a simple majority must be surmounted. This forms the final secondary research question: How can secular militaries be pluralistic without limiting the practice of religion in the ranks?
This final section will introduce how the study is organized based on the research questions identified earlier. This study will attempt to establish a correlation between religion and the will to fight, through a qualitative case study analysis of four different secular militaries, namely the Indian Army, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the US Army, and the Soviet Army. The case studies will examine how these militaries did or did not encourage religious practice within the ranks, and the subsequent effect on their will to fight. From this analysis, the researcher will present suggestions or recommendations for secular military institutions and commanders to apply in supporting the practice of religion among soldiers.
It is important to caveat that this study does not intend to definitively attribute religion as the only determinant of will to fight, nor is its purpose to conclude that will to fight is the panacea that guarantees victory in conflict. It is well understood that conflicts and their motivations are multi-faceted and complex, and any attempt to frame an understanding of combat to religion alone would be fatally narrow-minded. Instead, this study is only meant to unveil commonly over-looked aspects of the will to fight, and to provide policymakers and leaders with a better understanding of one of the under-utilized motivators that can be harnessed to better inspire soldiers in battle.
The first major assumption is that will to fight is an important determinant of a military's operational effectiveness. Though the will to fight is intangible and measured through proxies, it is a well-established notion that the psychological readiness and resilience of soldiers are important contributors to their ability to perform under the stresses of combat. At the same time, the outcomes of conflicts are decided by variables beyond will to fight alone. To ensure that the assumption is valid, this thesis will lean heavily on the conceptual foundation provided by RAND's study Will to Fight:
Returning to the Human Fundamentals of War that is discussed at greater length in the literature review and offer some further interpretations to strengthen the assumption. 
13
The final assumption is that secularizing trends that exist in civilian governments will be expressed in their militaries at an institutional level. This assumption is premised on the fact that militaries are generally subordinate to civilian control and are thus subject to the same secularizing forces that act on the ruling government. This assumption is central to the argument that secular militaries have to reconcile between the pressure to secularize as imposed by the ruling government, and the demands for religious accommodation from the soldiers they administer over.
This study examines an especially ambiguous topic dealing with several intangible concepts, and therefore warrants a discussion of the definitions to be used in this thesis. The first of such concepts is religion, which to date has no universally accepted definition because the institutions, religious texts, rituals, and worldviews of various faiths occupy a wide spectrum and are constantly changing. Hence, sociologists and religious studies experts have proposed various working definitions of religion.
Those definitions range from those centered on a substantive analysis of religious texts and doctrines, to post-modern critical theories that question whether religion can even be considered as a valid concept.

15
Understanding what constitutes religion sets the stage for understanding what constitutes the secular, its opposite. Within the confines of this thesis, the classification "secular" will refer to militaries that have no expressed affiliation with a religion, nor are they established to forward the cause of any religion, national or otherwise. By this token, a significant number of militaries in the world can be considered secular, including those that serve religiously-affiliated governments such as that in Turkey, or those that have a Chaplain Corps, like the US.
Finally, a working definition of will to fight was derived from RAND's study which is the "disposition and decision to fight, act, or persevere as needed." 
16
This study has two important limitations. First, it is qualitative in approach, because it is a first look at issues that pose challenges for measurement and implementation. Hence, the findings of this study cannot be generalized to all militaries, as it lacks statistical strength. Nevertheless, this study provides impetus for future research to better quantify the effects of religion in militaries. Second, the limited amount of research time confines the research to existing literature, as opposed to primary research in the form of interviews and data collection. This study has also set necessary delimitations given that it deals with a topic as sensitive and controversial as religion. Religion touches many aspects of governance, societal order, and culture beyond that expressed in militaries. There are established bodies of knowledge with opposing views arguing for and against the involvement of 16 Ben Connable, Michael J. McNerney, William Marcellino, Aaron Frank, Henry Hargrove, Marek N. Posard, S. Rebecca Zimmerman, Natasha Lander, Jasen J. Castillo, and James Sladden, Will to Fight: Analyzing, Modeling, and Simulating the Will to Fight of Military Units (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2018), 4. religion in statesmanship. While fascinating and powerful in scope, including such studies would detract from this study's purpose of understanding the military implications of the practice of religion. Hence, to properly address an area normally taken for granted, this study will not provide a detailed commentary on the role that religion plays in nations and societies, save for its manifestation in the military realm. This study will also not comment on the merits of one religion over another, in order to examine the benefits of religious practice in general and so respect the plurality and diversity that is a military's strength. Finally, this study will also not serve to proselytize nor explore whether it is necessary for all military members to profess a religion-doing so would negate this study's utility to secular policymakers.
This chapter introduced the potential problem of an erosion in will to fight for secular militaries that inadvertently submit to secularizing pressures and thus forgo religious accommodation. The chapter also highlighted that the goal of this study is to offer practical steps for secular militaries to improve combat effectiveness by harnessing the relationship between religion and will to fight. Framing this study is the primary research question, "How can secular militaries harness the relationship between the religion of individual soldiers and will to fight as a force multiplier to improve combat effectiveness?" It is supported by three SRQs, (1) "What is the relationship between will to fight and the practice of religion in the ranks?" (2) "What conditions can secular militaries set to foster the practice of religion while remaining secular?" and (3) "How can secular militaries be pluralistic without limiting the practice of religion in the ranks?"
The next chapter will review the existing literature to establish a theoretical basis for answering these questions.
CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Following on from the research questions established in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 comprises a review of the existing literature regarding religion and will to fight to inform the subsequent analysis. The literature review is organized into three sections as part of an approach that moves from the general to the particular, beginning with the broad themes of religion and will to fight, then narrowing down to focus on their application in secular militaries today.
The first section introduces the concepts of religion and secularization, and their influence on societies and state governance at large. The second section introduces the recently formulated concept of will to fight and outlines the RAND Corporation's proposed working definition. Although the concept is still being refined, this thesis will use the framework provided by RAND to identify possible elaborations of how religious belief and spiritual practices contribute to will to fight. This section also highlights the prevailing compartmentalized view of religion in military doctrine.
The final section will set the stage for understanding the evaluation criteria by revealing the consistent themes that emerge among analysts of religion's role in the military. This study will adapt these themes into the three variables: Organization, Leadership, and Policies, the most relevant components of the DOTMLPF-P framework to be applied in the analysis.
This literature review will first draw on three areas of scholarship to establish a theoretical foundation for understanding religion's role in the will to fight: (1) academic research regarding the theoretical definition of religion; (2) sociological studies of secularization and de-secularization; and (3) national security studies highlighting how militaries perceive religion's role. Collectively, these discussions set the context for understanding how secular governments and their militaries interact with religion.
Any research related to religion recognizes that it is a complex, multi-faceted, and difficult subject to unravel, spanning the fields of sociology, philosophy, political science, and psychology. Depending on the discipline, different definitions of religion emerge. In its extensive review of scholarly discussion regarding religion's role in conflict and peace-building, the British Academy identified that several academic definitions centered around an institutional understanding of religion, in which religion comprised a "system of beliefs and attendant organizational structures, that serve to lead believers in worship of a supra-natural deity that both represents and dictates some absolute truths."

The next concept to grasp is secularization and its opposite de-secularization. The difficulty in precisely defining these two concepts indicates the extent to which religion's relation to state governance has evolved over the centuries. A modern understanding of secularization characterizes it as a process whereby "religion -seen as a way of thinking, as the performance of particular practices, and as the institutionalization and organization of these patterns of thought and actions -has lost influence at the societal and at the individual level." 
30

32
The subsequent periods of the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment sowed the seeds for the modern understanding of secularization witnessed in the 20th century. This can be seen in the Reformation's rejection of the "substantive" aspects of the dominant Catholicism of the time (i.e. sacraments, indulgences and ecclesial hierarchy) and the Enlightenment's subsequent exaltation of human reason's capacity to arrive at truth, as opposed to truth being divinely revealed.

From the 1980s onwards, the world witnessed a resurgence in religiosity, in what seemed to be a counter-response to ongoing secularization. In his later work, Berger (seen as the main exponent of Secularization theory) conceded that the world was as religious as ever, and perhaps even more so than before, in light of religious revivals like that of Evangelicalism in America, and Islam in the Middle East and Muslim countries around the world.

As such, an aggressive expansion of secularity that is nihilistic and categorical in its destruction of transcendent beliefs leaves people in an "impoverished and finally untenable condition," thus provoking a strong counter-action.

Now imagine an observer who looks at the pendulum as it approaches the lowest point of its semicircular trajectory. If the observer applies a limited timeframe (of, say, two hundred years) to make sense of what is going on, s/he is likely to end up with a story of a recent linear descent. The trajectory the observer will quite honestly report will likely be a downwardly directed straight line, which, in relation to the pendulum's actual curve will be like a tangent drawn near a semicircle's lowest point. It will be difficult for the observer to envision the observed descent as a fragment of a much longer cyclical movement which is about to enter into its ascending phase. To an extent, our reports about secularization (and desecularization) are somewhat similar to the hypothetical observer's honest but shortsighted account.

The two counter-acting forces of secularization and de-secularization catch public institutions like schools, healthcare organizations, and militaries in the middle, torn between fulfilling a secular role imposed by political masters but lobbied by the people they serve to accommodate their religious beliefs and preferences. Berger's analysis sheds further light on why secularization was so rampant in the last century. Rather than attributing secularization to modernization per se, it is the plurality brought about by modernization and globalization that provide fuel to the fire. Religious traditions now have to contend with each other in a compressed marketplace of ideas, and the state governments administering such a "public space" often resort to a secularist approach in

As a public institution, national militaries are no exception to being caught between secularizing and de-secularizing forces. As religion and foreign policy scholar Eric Patterson suggests, the militaries of many countries are a microcosm of the dynamic between religious and nonreligious groups or organizations in civil society.

The same struggles faced by secular regimes in regulating a religious polity will also be manifest in the military if it secularizes in response to increased pluralism in the ranks and continues to treat religion merely as an operational variable in motivating its adversaries.

In tandem with a growing understanding that academia has not fully appreciated religion's potential in motivating one's own troops is the similar realization that military scholarship has departed from the conception of war as a fundamentally human endeavor.
The numerous instances in the last half-century of technologically outnumbered militaries overcoming vastly superior foes, ranging from the Vietnam War to the Soviet-Afghan War, brought the Clausewitzian understanding of war as a contest of wills back into focus. 
59
With a commission from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the sponsorship of Headquarters Department of the Army G3/5/7, RAND conducted a study that sought to define will to fight and determine the impact it had on the outcome of military operations.
Over a period of two years, RAND conducted extensive multiple-method research involving an in-depth literature review, interviews with military leaders, and quantitative modelling. The results of the study were comprehensive yet unsurprising. The research showed that despite the tacit acknowledgement of the importance of will to fight as a factor in war, the American understanding of will to fight was sorely deficit, and by extension that of its partners too. 
60
Hence, the first task of the study was to propose a working definition of military unit and organizational will to fight. The study's proposed definition is replicated as follows: "Military unit and organizational will to fight is defined as the disposition and decision to fight, act, or persevere as needed [emphasis added]."
61
62
A significant part of RAND's study involved the development of a framework to improve understanding of disposition to fight. The military unit organizational model encompassed five levels of analysis (State, Government, Organization, Unit, and Individual), three categories of factors (motivation, capabilities, and culture), 29 major factors, and 61 sub-factors mapped out with three different durability ratings. To validate the framework, the military organizational disposition to fight model was applied to historical cases in which will to fight was decisive, including the Battle of Verdun in World War I, the Vietnam War, the First Chechen War, and the incursions into Iraq by the Islamic State.

64
The pertinent areas in which religion can be applied are first at the individual level of analysis. Out of the five factors under the Motivation category, two are linked to religion, represented by the Ideology and Identity factors. Ideology is a "commitment to a cause or belief system"-in the religious sense, belief in the principles and values of the individual's professed religion i.e., the substantive aspects of religion. 
65
65
66
67
One limitation with such a comprehensive framework is that it spares little time to analyze how exactly religion operates as a sub-component within the realms of identity and ideology. The framework serves more as a foundation for future research. This thesis will be the first of hopefully future attempts to bridge the gap by tying together some of the salient insights from earlier authors who have already made suggestions regarding the influence of religion on will to fight or its understood equivalents.
Even with RAND's proposed framework, there has been comparatively less analytic rigor applied to understanding religion as inspiring will to fight, with the bulk of military scholarship focusing on religion as a cause of conflict. Nevertheless, several have attempted to unpack the complex and at times amorphous relationship between religion, will, and victory in conflict. Herrera's and Quin's thesis regarding "will to win" in their study of asymmetric warfare in the Middle East cited Jules Masseman's defense that "Man is sustained by the belief (however unfounded at times) that he is not alone and that if he does all he can to survive and the danger still grows, someone-perhaps even 67 Ibid., 52-54. God-will come to his aid and save him." 68 With that intellectual foundation, they proposed four ways religion acts as a motivator in conflict: appropriateness (acting based on a sense of right), identity (related with purpose, and sense of belonging both in this life and in the afterlife), rationality (religion provides an over-arching long-term justification for near-term actions), and religion's internally consistent logic (religion cannot be disproved because the absence of God cannot be proven). 
69
Over a decade later, Ron E. Hassner made greater strides in linking religion and will to fight. In his book Religion on the Battlefield, he argues that religion can be both a force multiplier and a force divider in conflict.

cites the example of how religious festivals that celebrate martyrdom can spur combatants to greater fervor. 
72
This study therefore builds on Hassner's research and delves deeper into the interaction between religion and combat effectiveness by examining how the practice of religion can increase individual and collective will to fight. These works described above provide the intellectual basis for this thesis to proceed with the understanding that religion has a positive relationship with will to fight, and will to fight in turn has a positive relationship with combat effectiveness. In summary, allowing faith to flourish within the ranks can significantly improve combat effectiveness, while suppressing religious expression in the name of secularization can severely limit it. 
73
73
74
Unfortunately, the prevailing literature contains little study on how militaries foster an enabling religious environment to fortify will to fight in the lead-up to, and during the conduct of war. Instead, most scholarship is concentrated in the area of resilience literature, comprising psychological studies on the effect of religiosity in helping veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Another shortcoming of the current academic discourse is its preoccupation with spirituality as a coping mechanism. The premise is that spirituality refers to "an individual's core sense of purpose, which is based on shared values and beliefs about their personal identity and contributes to their sense of dignity, meaning, and Though meritorious, the downside of such a focus on a universal spirituality can easily degrade into humanism. As earlier established, spirituality and religion are two distinct but interrelated concepts. As such, over-emphasizing the common spirituality that all soldiers share would skew the balance towards an overt focus on what constitutes the functional aspect of religion (how religion makes one feel), at the expense of paying attention to the benefits of its substantive aspect (religion's ideals and morals).
When considering how secularizing forces often play up the same-ness of humanity to circumvent the need for authentic religion, the potential pitfalls of an overemphasis on spirituality become more apparent. As religion comprises both the substantive and the functional, any disproportionate emphasis on the functional component (spirituality) would dilute true religious practice and ultimately descend into a manifestation of pluralistic secularism. 
82
In short, there lies a glaring disparity in the academic research on this topic: religion has the potential to improve will to fight, but research thus far has concentrated only on spirituality and its utility post-combat. This gap in understanding the beneficial

Having addressed the shortcomings of the available literature in examining religion's potential to improve will to fight, this literature review will conclude with identifying the broad variables of an enabling religious environment to help frame the case study analysis.

84
Although different militaries have produced outcomes with varying degrees of success, this thesis has identified three enduring yet distinguishable traits of an enabling religious environment that apply to all militaries: Organization, Leadership, and Policies. 
83
85
86
This thesis synthesizes both frameworks and derives three factors that are relevant to religion's impact on will to fight. Hassner's "demographics" and "force structure" can be combined under "Organization" of DOTMLPF-P. Based on the JCIDS Manual, Organization pertains to a "joint unit or element with varied functions enabled by a 85 Ron E. Hassner, Religion in the Military Worldwide (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 10, https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/religion-in-themilitary-worldwide/C700E4705A22ED5150DD7094E38284F6. Using Organization to examine how militaries design their force structures in line with demographics is a well-established practice that features heavily in research on military manpower policy and ethnic demography. Militaries have paid much attention to the ethnic demographics of its subordinate units, out of concerns of avoiding ethnic tension, and also attempting to mirror the diversity in society at large.

Hassner's sacred leaders, or more commonly known as chaplains, comprise religious professionals within the formal military structure. It is also possible that militaries without religious professionals may nominate military leaders to undergo some form of religious training, and thus perform some of the functions a religious professional would have done. This would map "sacred leaders" with the "Leadership and Education" consideration. The JCIDS manual defines Leadership and education as the "professional development of joint leaders that is the product of a learning continuum that comprises training, experience, education, and self-improvement." 
94
Out of the three evaluation criteria, the chaplain corps (or its equivalent) represents the most tangible representation of the intersection between religion and the military. This is corroborated by the plentiful sources of literature about the roles of chaplains, the politics of the selection of chaplains, and the challenges that chaplains face in managing religious diversity. 
95
While the truth is far from that, the utility of chaplains in fostering will to fight is an enduring theme in many of the militaries examined and should therefore be explored.
This study leans on Hassner's analysis of the role of sacred leaders as motivating factors. 
96
98
The rituals and practices defined in Hassner's study do not immediately fall under any of the DOTMLPF-P considerations. However, a deeper examination reveals that religious practices such as the affixing of symbols, the accommodation of religious attire, and the apportionment of prayer time for believers are all regulated by military dictums, known as "Policies." The policy DOTMLPF-P consideration consists of "any DoD, interagency or international policy issues that may impact effective implementation of changes in the other DOTMLPF-P considerations." 
99
A useful encapsulation of the common components relevant to Policies is found in Guide on Religion and Belief in the Armed Forces, a policy document published by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD). 
100
"give those [in the Armed Forces] who wish to do so the opportunity to practice their religious observances wherever possible subject to vital considerations of operational effectiveness, health and safety and business needs." 101 Within the guide, several sections are devoted to providing policy guidance in specific areas of religious observance. These sections include "Time Off and Facilities for Prayer during the Working Day," "Dress," and "Dietary Needs." 102 The MoD's publication of such a document is a useful example that demonstrates how militaries use Policies to apply religious accommodation within the daily lives of soldiers. It reaffirms the selection of Policies as a final variable to be used in analyzing the case studies.
This chapter has established the conditions for analysis by providing the theoretical underpinnings to understand secularization and de-secularization, will to fight, and religion's role in inspiring will to fight. The literature review has identified the dangers posed to a military by inadvertently adopting an overly secularist approach to manage a possibly de-secularized mass. This danger is manifest in the erosion of will to fight, of which religion is an important sub-component. However, the literature lacks sufficient rigorous analysis of how religion is fostered as a catalyst for will to fight, because the scholarship is narrowly focused on religion as a coping mechanism for post-101 MoD UK, Guide on Religion and Belief in the UK Armed Forces, 4.

To aid in the analysis, the literature review has yielded three evaluation criteria comprising common themes among secular militaries, namely Organization, Leadership, and Policies. These form the universally applicable variables of any military with regard to how religion is accommodated among the ranks. Applying these variables to the subsequent analysis will shed light on the degree to which religion influences will to fight in the militaries selected for examination. The methodology selected to analyze the conditions that best foster the practice of religion, in answer of the primary research question, will be discussed in the subsequent chapter.
This chapter will detail the selected methodology for this study and will provide a brief discussion of why a qualitative method was selected. The research methodology will serve to answer the primary research question of "How can secular militaries harness the relationship between the religion of individual soldiers and will to fight as a force multiplier to improve combat readiness?" This research question necessitates the answering of three secondary research questions, the first of which pertains to the relationship between religion and the will to fight, while the latter two pertain to the ways in which secular militaries can foster the practice of religion while retaining their secular character and without showing deference to any particular religion.
The literature review has afforded a theoretical context in which to conduct the analysis. Importantly, it identified three evaluation criteria-organization, leadership, and policies-that represent the means through which militaries foster, ignore, or suppress the expression of religion. This chapter will detail how the evaluation criteria will be applied in a case study analysis of four militaries, and briefly describe the means of data collection and presentation.
Based on the nature of the research question and the data available, this thesis will adopt an inductive approach, employing a qualitative methodology comprising an exploratory case study approach as a research strategy.

As the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between religion and will to fight and the factors that influence this relationship, the preferred choice of methodology is qualitative. John Creswell, a notable academic authority on qualitative research, emphasized that the qualitative methodology is best suited for research problems which "address the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem." 104 This is because the qualitative method allows the researcher to explore a problem or issue through the use of interpretive/theoretical frameworks while holding certain assumptions. 
105
Within the qualitative tradition, the case study strategy is the most feasible approach. Creswell defines case study research as a "qualitative approach in which the investigator explores a real-life, contemporary bounded system (a case) or multiple bounded systems (cases) over time, through detailed, in-depth data collection involving multiple sources of information, and reports a case description and case themes." 
106
107
The quantitative approach has limited utility in this study because religion and will to fight are complex social phenomena that cannot easily be quantitatively measured within the timeframe allowed for this research. The ongoing academic discourse highlighted in Chapter 2 about what constitutes a consistent, concrete definition of religion is evidence that it would not only be difficult, but misleading to attempt to define religion in quantitative terms. Similarly, the authors of the RAND study on will to fight acknowledge that "disposition to fight and human agency defy meaningful quantification," but these should not be reasons to ignore any analysis of it.

The data will be derived from historical accounts of battles, doctrinal publications, journal articles, policy regulations, chaplains' diaries, and other secondary sources related to the theme of "religious support." The search terms used to gather data will include "religion," "faith," "spirituality," "morality," as representative of religion in militaries; and "will," "morale," "commitment," "cohesion," "discipline," and "courage" will be used to proxy will to fight.
This study will focus exclusively on the army branch of the military in each of the case studies, as the land forces component comprises the largest branch of the military and would offer the most insight into the control of religion by its sheer size. The analysis could include data from the naval and air forces, but only where relevant so as not to complicate the already complex analysis.
The secular armies of four countries, namely India, Israel, the United States of America (US), and the Soviet Union (USSR) are selected as the cases for analysis. They represent a spectrum of conditions in three areas: (1) differing degrees of secularization (from least secularized in India to atheistic in USSR); (2) different methods of recruitment (all-volunteer force versus draft); and (3) different cultures and geography (North America, Asia, Europe, and Middle East). Analyzing cases that differ significantly 109 Ibid., 4-5.
can possibly yield perspectives that can be extrapolated to cases elsewhere. The time frame for analysis will be bounded from World War II onwards until present-day, less the Soviet Union which was dissolved in 1991. This time period is valid because it corresponds with the period during which the US and USSR rose to prominence as global powers, and also when India and Israel became independent sovereign nations (in 1947 and 1948 respectively). See Figure

Subsequently, the military's actions with regard to each of the three variables will be assessed as to whether those actions improved or degraded the will to fight, ultimately affecting the outcome of the wars in question. Using themes from the literature review, each variable is broken down into sub-components for finer-grained analysis. These results will be populated in a table for graphical representation, and each intersection between the case and the variable will be ascribed a value of "+," "-," or "/." Ascribing a "+" would indicate that the military's actions in that variable had a positive impact on will to fight through religion, which led to a positive outcome in war. Conversely, a "-" indicates that the military's decisions regarding that variable had a degrading effect on will to fight, resulting in a negative impact on the military's combat effectiveness in war.
Finally, a "/" would indicate that the military's actions did not favor or degrade will to fight. Building on the earlier example of the Soviet-Afghan War, a possible assessment under the "Leadership" variable could be that the lack of sacred leaders led to low will to fight in the Soviet military, leading to their eventual failure in the war. This would translate into a "-" value being ascribed to the appropriate sub-component in the table.
See Table 
1
At the conclusion of each case, the results will be collated in a table for ease of representation, and an overall value assigned for each of the variables. See Table 
2
Finally, at the end of the chapter, the results from all the cases will be consolidated in a summary table for ease of comparison. A brief synthesis of the points will be provided for each variable. See Table

In summary, this study will employ a qualitative approach with an exploratory case study strategy to examine how secular militaries can build an enabling religious environment to foster greater will to fight. The selection of a qualitative approach supports the analysis of religion and will to fight, which are variables that do not lend themselves to quantitative measurement. The study will examine four cases, namely India, Israel, US, and the Soviet Union, using the three evaluation criteria of organization, leadership, and policies. The analysis will be elaborated on in Chapter 4 and summarized in a comparative table at the end of the chapter.
CHAPTER 4
To answer the primary research question of "how can secular militaries harness the relationship between religion of the individual soldiers and will to fight as a force multiplier to improve combat readiness?" this chapter will apply a case study analysis of four different militaries (India, Israel, US, and USSR) in that order to examine the relationship between organizational, leadership, and policy considerations in the realm of religious accommodation and will to fight.
The researcher will examine each case study to introduce the role of religion in the nation itself, the characteristics of the military in question, and the military's performance in combat with a brief discussion of its level of will to fight. The researcher will then analyze in detail the military's approach to the three variables of organization, leadership, and policies. After each case study is reviewed, the researcher will summarize the information analysis with a consolidation of the results in a representative table.
The Indian Armed Forces is a concrete example of a religiously diverse military charged with the defense of a constitutionally secular state while commanding a numerous force of religiously observant personnel. Its land component, the Indian Army, is the second-largest ground force in the world in terms of active-duty personnel. 110 Its origins date back to the colonial-era Indian armed forces comprising the British East India Company's armies and the armies of the Indian princely states. Upon attaining independence from British rule in 1947, these forces were nationalized and gathered into the modern Indian Army.

India itself is a secular state, even though its citizens are highly religious. Despite being majority Hindu, India chose a secular orientation at independence to demonstrate its openness to all religious communities as a means of contesting its neighbor Pakistan's establishment as a state for Muslims. 
113
Demographically, Hindus comprise the majority at 79.8 percent, Muslims at 14.2 percent, Christians at 2.3 percent, Sikhs at 1.7 percent, and others and unspecified at 2 percent.

The Indian Army is a positive example of how its organization of units facilitates the creation of an enabling religious environment. The Indian Army is an all-volunteer force and organizes its units according to three archetypes: (1) "single class" units, (2) "fixed class" units, and (3) "all India all class" units.

136
In sum, the Indian Army employs the Organizational variable to considerable effect in creating an enabling religious environment, as the majority of its units are religiously homogeneous thus allowing a common religious identity within the regiments.
In the fixed class or all class units, the Army employs the officer corps as a mediating structure to address the needs of religious minorities. The use of Organization as a consideration to foster religious accommodation is not limited to peacetime, and features significantly in operations-in the Kargil conflict earlier described, the 70th Brigade in the key Batalik sector comprised battalions from homogeneous regiments such as the 14 Sikh (Sikh) and 1/11 Gurkha Rifles (Hindu), as well as mixed units such as the 5 Para SF.

They preach uplifting sermons prior to combat, using anecdotes and quotes from sacred scriptures such as the Hindu Mahabharata and Sikh Dasam Granth to enliven a sense of fervor and pride in the unit. They dispense blessings for soldiers, pray for victory, and even lead in worship of weapons through special rites.

The religiously supportive environment of the Indian Army was put to the test in a complex counter-insurgency operation known as Operation Blue Star in 1984. The insurgency was initiated in the Punjab region by Sikh separatists who were agitating against the federal Indian government for an autonomous Sikh state. The leader of the extremists, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, occupied the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), Sikhism's holiest shrine, turning it into a stronghold which he knew the military forces would be reluctant to attack.

However, closer analysis reveals that the Indian Army's mechanisms introduced to accommodate religion had helped prevent the mutiny from spiraling out of control. Amit Ahuja highlights how the officer corps was employed as the "primary bulwark against the widespread breakdown of discipline," acting as an internal mediating structure to address the grievances of disaffected Sikh soldiers and thus contain the rebellion.

In spite of these challenges, the IDF's history is replete with instances of excellent performance in war characterized by high will to fight under dire circumstances. The IDF has been engaged in conflict since its inception, where the moment Israel was declared independent on 14 May 1948 marked the beginning of the First Arab-Israeli war. Since then, the IDF has fought seven wars and numerous limited operations, emerging as the victor in the majority of the engagements.

In contrast to the limited efficacy of internal initiatives, the IDF has enjoyed better results in collaborations with external religious institutions acting as mediating structures to address the religious needs of Haredi soldiers. Two of such institutions are the Yeshivot Hesder (literally "Talmud Academy Arrangement") and the Mekhina ("preconscription") programs, which comprise a combination of Talmudic study and military duty over varying periods of service.

However, in terms of vulnerability, the IDF rabbinate has had a mixed record.

Naturally, the religiously observant soldiers of the IDF were caught in a dilemma, especially those belonging to units assigned to execute the disengagement operation.
Rabbinic communities issued denunciations of the decision, with some of the yeshiva national-religious schools calling for their students in the IDF to disobey orders.

Although the US Army has undergone drastic changes in its organization and force structure over the past seventy years, it has remained consistent in how its units have remained largely heterogeneous in terms of religion. When segregation was still in force, the US Army organized units by ethnicity; subsequently, after desegregation was announced in 1948, the US Army began the long slow process of forming integrated units.

To circumvent these challenges, the US Army relies heavily on an internal mediating structure, the Chaplain Corps. The Chaplain Corps is the primary instrument

Chaplain Liteky was participating in a search and destroy operation when Company A came under intense fire from a battalion size enemy force. Momentarily stunned from the immediate encounter that ensued, the men hugged the ground for cover. Observing two wounded men, Chaplain Liteky moved to within 15 meters of an enemy machinegun position to reach them, placing himself between the enemy and the wounded men. When there was a brief respite in the fighting, he managed to drag them to the relative safety of the landing zone. Inspired by his courageous actions, the company rallied and began placing a heavy volume of fire upon the enemy's positions. In a magnificent display of courage and leadership, Chaplain Liteky began moving upright through the enemy fire, administering last rites to the dying and evacuating the wounded.

On 1 November, as Chinese Communist Forces viciously attacked friendly elements, Chaplain Kapaun calmly walked through withering enemy fire in order to provide comfort and medical aid to his comrades and rescue friendly wounded from no-man's land. Though the Americans successfully repelled the assault, they found themselves surrounded by the enemy. Facing annihilation, the able-bodied men were ordered to evacuate. However, Chaplain Kapaun, fully aware of his certain capture, elected to stay behind with the wounded.
Shortly after his capture, Chaplain Kapaun, with complete disregard for his personal safety and unwavering resolve, bravely pushed aside an enemy soldier preparing to execute Sergeant First Class Herbert A. Miller. Not only did Chaplain Kapaun's gallantry save the life of Sergeant Miller, but also his unparalleled courage and leadership inspired all those present, including those who might have otherwise fled in panic, to remain and fight the enemy until captured.

The US Army's policies regarding religious accommodation today are derived from Department of Defense Instruction 1300.17, Religious Liberty in the Military Services (dated 1 September 2020), which categorically spells out the maintenance of "mission accomplishment, military readiness, unit cohesion, standards, [and] discipline" as the principal consideration for any accommodation. 
264
275
276
Although this approach is feasible because the US Army is all-volunteer, there is a risk that the burden of accommodation is disproportionately weighed on lower levels of command who might not have the requisite background in comparative religions to make a qualified decision.

Having established how effective the US Army's chaplains are at raising combat motivation, where were they in the jungles of Vietnam?

The US Army's experience in employing religion to foster will to fight in a large and religiously diverse military has proven successful. Although its units are not religiously homogeneous, the US Army relies heavily on its Chaplain Corps as sacred leaders who advocate for the needs of religious minorities, instill discipline and morality in the ranks, and inspire courage in their soldiers by putting their lives at risk at the frontlines. The US Army has also demonstrated a cautious flexibility in its policies of religious accommodation, delegating authority to lower echelon commanders for the majority of requests for accommodation, but retaining the authority to deliberate on exceptions to policy at the highest levels of command. This model supports the religiously heterogeneous organization of the US Army, and its competing need for uniformity which is particularly important given its immense size and global reach. However, the US Army cannot afford to remain static, as the growing religious diversity of its ranks (including the "Spiritual but Not Religious") requires further adaptation to ensure an enabling religious environment is preserved.

The conscript's morale was not great when he was drafted. At the training centers, conscripts were told that they were going to fight Chinese and American mercenaries.

Throughout World War II and the Cold War, the Soviet Army did not use organizational means nor the introduction of policies to accommodate religion. The only considerations in unit organization that were distantly related to religious affiliation was ethnicity.

Although the Soviet Army did not employ any religious leaders as chaplains, it relied heavily on political commissars to foster the will to fight of its units, with the commissars being "responsible for matters such as morale, motivation, combat readiness, discipline, political socialization and so on." 304 Commissars were assigned down to the company level while reporting to GlavPUR, the Soviet military's secular equivalent of the Chaplain Corps-with the key difference being that commissars were expected to preach a "religion" of Marxist-Leninist dogma. 305 However, the political commissars were only as effective as Communism was in promoting will to fight. As greater numbers of soldiers grew disillusioned with the disparity between promise and reality, the commissars were increasingly unable to invoke Communism as a "sacred cause" to rally soldiers around.

At the heart of this study was the question of whether faith makes a force better at fighting. The tendency towards increasing secularization, or at least the perception that secularity is necessary, has been used by states to manage increasing plurality within the ranks of incoming soldiers, either through conscription or as volunteers. At one level, this can give rise to the problem of discontentment among religious masses within the military forces towards their secular leadership. Militaries, as microcosms of the societies they serve, grapple with the same issues too. But is the problem as acute for militaries, and what do they stand to lose by continuing to ride the wave of secularism? This thesis argues precisely that the implications are more far-reaching than just the risk of discontent. Militaries are built upon cohesive units. Any lack of religious accommodation has a more pronounced effect within militaries as divides within the ranks undermine cohesion and erode combat power. Conversely, militaries miss out on a potential multiplier of combat power in failing to harness the beneficial effects of religious practice on will to fight, given that robust religious practice bears a close affinity with subcomponents of will to fight such as ideology (commitment to a cause or belief system) and identity. At the same time, this study recognized that militaries face real, difficult challenges when trying to accommodate religion.
If religion has a beneficial impact on will to fight, then why are militaries generally reluctant to introduce means of accommodation? Militaries are hierarchical, dominant organizations that demand compliance and conformity from its members, and religion is perceived, often with valid concerns, as a threat to this structure. Furthermore, religion is often compartmentalized as just a variable contributing to the threat level in the operational environment, without consideration for the intrinsic effect it has on one's own troops given the lack of available scholarship explicating these effects. In light of these challenges, militaries find it more expedient to avoid the issue of religious accommodation and instead foster secular environments that are inimical to religious practice.
This presents secular militaries with a dilemma: accommodate religion and run the risk of religious fervor stoking insubordination, or excise religion altogether and risk an erosion of will to fight. This thesis sought to establish a via media between the two poles and demonstrate that it is possible for militaries to strike the right balance. From this motive arose the primary research question of examining how militaries could create conditions and employ levers to foster an enabling religious environment, i.e., ""How can secular militaries harness the relationship between will to fight and the religion of individual soldiers as a force multiplier to improve combat readiness?" This primary research question was supported by three secondary research questions, aimed at helping secular militaries reconcile the competing tensions of plurality, accommodation, and military obedience. The literature review provided a theoretical lens of Organization, Leadership, and Policies with which to understand what constituted an enabling religious environment (or the lack thereof) in each case. Case study analyses of the armies of India, Israel, US, and USSR viewed these militaries through this theoretical lens, yielding an over-arching conclusion: secular militaries can and should encourage religious expression among the rank and file to maintain or even improve will to fight. The next two sections elaborate on both parts of that conclusion militaries can create an enabling religious environment while remaining secular and pluralistic, by employing a combination of organizational, leadership, and policy levers in line with the operational context that the military is situated in. The following paragraphs discuss the interplay between the three variables and suggest possible combinations that secular militaries can adopt.
Among the three variables, Organization was found to produce the greatest effect, and served as a foundation for the other two variables to be employed with greater facility. The Indian Army demonstrated this example best. By raising "single-class" and "fixed-class" units, it introduced significant degrees of religious homogeneity into its ranks and facilitated the religious accommodation through leadership (assigning religious teachers of the same faith as that of the unit) and policies (commanders can take a uniform approach to the majority religion within the unit). At the same time, the example of homogeneous units cannot be replicated across all militaries, as in the case of the IDF and the US Army which maintained heterogeneous units for reasons of nation-building and operational flexibility. Nonetheless, the Indian Army's experience reveals that religious affiliation should be one of the considerations militaries factor in as part of designing their force structure under their manpower policies, both at the point of recruitment and in operational units.
As an alternative, secular militaries can employ the Organization variable to great effect by either creating internal organizations or cooperating with external organizations to act as mediating structures that help to represent the religious needs of minorities. This is an important mechanism to deal with plurality, which was present in the IDF (Hesder program), the US Army (the Chaplain Corps), and even in the Indian Army (the secular officer corps). A suggestion therefore is for secular militaries that cannot have homogeneously organized units to invest instead in mediating structures.
The case studies also showed that the Leadership variable significantly contributed to building an enabling religious environment, as sacred leaders within the military hierarchy were a visible representation of the interaction between religion and military life. From the religious teachers recruited in the Indian Army, to the rabbis of the IDF rabbinate, to the chaplains of the US Army Chaplain Corps, all of the sacred leaders served the common purpose of religious instruction and religious support.
Furthermore, within the realm of improving will to fight, these religious leaders had an additional effect that went beyond the provision of religious services. Through their sermons, their accessibility, and simply their presence, these ministers increased morale among the troops, leading to improved performance in battles; even the Soviet Army, by relaxing its persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, saw a surge of combat motivation in World War II after Russian Orthodox priests were allowed among the ranks again. More importantly, these sacred leaders had the greatest effect on will to fight when they were most vulnerable, placing themselves in the thick of battle alongside the soldiers they were ministering to. Conversely, once sacred leaders failed to be present with the troops when the threat was most imminent, they had a counter-productive effect on morale, as seen in the resentment towards the political commissars of the Soviet regime.
Finally, Policies act as a complementary variable as its effectiveness is closely tied to how a secular military employs the Organization and the Leadership variables. Indeed, militaries rarely formulate policies in a vacuum, as it would be difficult for a military to enact policies encouraging maximum freedom of religious expression but without the supporting organizational considerations nor sacred leader structures. Yet, policies are important because soldiers live in a world of rules and regulations that go towards ensuring uniformity and discipline. Therefore, policies are a visible manifestation of a military's approach towards religious accommodation, thus forming the final mechanism through which militaries can create an enabling religious environment.
It is worth noting that a secular military can vary its emphasis on each of the three variables to produce its desired outcome, as seen in how each of the cases employed different permutations of the variables. However, the variables all interact to form an overall environment of religious accommodation (or lack thereof), forming a type of "three-legged stool" in which no single leg should be disproportionately shorter or longer than the others. In other words, for a secular military to produce the best outcomes in religious accommodation, it should strive to achieve a good balance between the different variables. As an example, the US Army could overcome the limitations faced by a pluralistic Chaplain Corps in dealing with an increasingly diverse group of religiously unaffiliated soldiers by co-opting civilian religious groups as external mediating structures, while maintaining its heterogeneous approach to the organization of units and sustaining its emphasis on the Chaplain Corps' ministry of presence at the frontlines.
At the close of this study, it is important to return to the deeper question underpinning it: should militaries be using these three variables to foster an enabling religious environment? Restated another way, this section seeks to answer the first SRQ: "What is the relationship between will to fight and the practice of religion in the ranks?" RAND's organizational will to fight model provided a theoretical basis to understand the relationship between religion and will to fight. A closer examination of the four cases has illuminated finer-grained insights into that relationship, demonstrating that the practice of religion in the ranks has a positive impact on will to fight, and is manifest at the individual, unit, and institutional levels.
At the individual level, religious expression improves will to fight by giving a sense of purpose and hope. When confronted with the possibility of death in combat, soldiers who turn to faith likely do so because they believe that a divine power is in control of the outcome. Providing a soldier with the opportunity to pray and observe religious practices allows him to exercise his belief in the divine power's ability to preserve him from death, or at the very least guarantee an afterlife.
Even the atheistic Soviet regime recognized the human desire for transcendence that the Marxist-Leninist ideology was unable to provide in the face of dire circumstances during World War II. Hence, Stalin relieved the restraints on the Russian Orthodox Church, due in large part to the Soviet regime's desperation to use all means possible to inspire the Russian people to continue fighting. Similarly, the exemplary courage of individual US Army chaplains who entered combat zones unarmed inspired their fellow troops to believe that God was with them even in the face of imminent danger. Even though this study does not venture to answer whether the divine power soldiers were entreating was indeed responsible for whether they lived or died, the important takeaway is that their religious belief itself was sufficient to raise their will to fight.
At the unit level, religion improves the disposition to fight by enhancing the cohesiveness of the unit. This was evident in the Indian Army's homogeneous units, which were brought together by mandir parades, collective prayers, and even battle cries invoking the intercession of their unit deities. The veneration of unit deities was almost synonymous with the regiment's pride and identity. As the unit took part in religious rites together, they solidified their commitment to each other, improving the disposition to fight. However, these observations do not mean that religion is the most important contributor to will to fight. The operational successes of the Indian Army were due also to good leadership and discipline enforced by strong organizational control through the officer corps. These components of will to fight cannot be substituted by religion alone.
At the institutional level, religious accommodation enhances will to fight by improving the trust and credibility of the military organization as a whole. If done successfully, religious accommodation of potentially disaffected minorities can lead to their greater commitment to the military institution. This was observed in the IDF's drive to make military service attractive to the ultra-Orthodox Jews by enforcing policies that facilitated observance of halakhic law and cooperating with civilian institutions such as the Hesder programs. Gradually, the IDF's efforts encouraged increasing numbers of Haredi soldiers to enlist, and kept not only these conscripts, but the wider ultra-Orthodox religious community committed to the IDF's purpose despite controversial operations like the disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005. Although the IDF still has some way to go in fully accommodating the ultra-Orthodox Jews and the other religious minorities (Druze, Christians, Circassians, etc), its ability to project itself as a trusted organization to the ultra-Orthodox community is a promising start.
Although this thesis has demonstrated why secular militaries should foster an enabling religious environment, it also registers a note of caution to avoid viewing religion as a silver bullet in building will to fight. If secular militaries veer to the other extreme of aggressively promoting (one) religion for the ostensible reason of enhancing combat motivation, then the danger is the promotion of a single dominant belief system to the exclusion of all others, which would ultimately be just a religious variant of the secularist worldview so prevalent today. This is best demonstrated in present-day events. As an epilogue to the Soviet Army case study, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a brief resurgence of religion in post-Soviet Russia.

Although it is too early to confirm such an observation given that the war is in progress at the time of writing, the developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict would still be an excellent source of analysis to understand religion's importance to both parties.

Recommendations for Future Research Although this study addressed several case studies at length, it merely scratched the surface of understanding religion's potential as a force multiplier within secular militaries. Significantly, the relationship between religion and will to fight can be examined in greater detail through quantitative means. Future research can build on the variables identified from this qualitative study and generate metrics to measure religion's influence on will to fight.
Future research can also build on this study by expanding the aperture of which militaries and which religions are examined. As this study focused exclusively on secular and religiously diverse countries, subsequent studies could apply the same variables and tease out the influence of religion on will to fight in religiously homogeneous militaries such as the Iranian Republican Guard, the Pakistani Army, and the militaries in predominantly Catholic Latin America. While this study assumed that religions in general had a positive influence on will to fight, future sociological research could determine the degree to which different religions contributed to will to fight among militaries, and thus serve to enrich a military's understanding of both its adversaries and its allies who are likely to profess different faiths. Finally, by developing a more quantitatively rigorous model of measuring religion's impact on will to fight, more accurate estimates can be made about the levels of will to fight in large, technologically advanced, but ostensibly areligious militaries like that of China.
In conclusion, this thesis set out to demonstrate that jumping on the secularization bandwagon could be detrimental for militaries. In the process, it found that religion still has a role to play in militaries and in the world. Having understood that what happens in society resonates in militaries, perhaps the reverse is true as well. Indeed, the demoralizing effects of the Soviet 40th Army's performance in Afghanistan caused ripples which eventually gathered into a tsunami of popular discontent that toppled the Soviet Union. Hence, rather than being a passive recipient of secularizing forces from the state, militaries could take the lead in fostering religious accommodation while remaining secular, thus setting the example for the rest of society to follow.

The three evaluation criteria of organization, leadership, and policies described in Chapter 2 form the basis for analysis. Each case will begin with a brief discussion of that military's history and purpose, and its involvement in recent wars and operations (at least
charged conflicts such as Operation Blue Star demonstrates how the Army views religion as an important component of will to fight.
The Indian Army's blend of organizational, leadership, and policy actions form a model that created an enabling religious environment in which religion fostered will to fight to a great extent. The existence of religiously homogeneous units plays a large role in laying the foundations for the selection of sacred leaders and the implementation of policies. However, while religious accommodation is easier in homogeneous units, the Indian Army's welcoming approach to religion is prevalent in mixed units as well, enabled by the officer corps as a mediating structure to help represent the interests of religious minorities.
Even though the Indian Army is expressly secular as an offshoot of India's secular constitution, religious practice has fostered a greater sense of belonging, identity, and ultimately will to fight. These are implicitly evident in the Indian Army's success in large scale operations like the Kargil Conflict, and to a reasonable extent in counterinsurgency operations such as Operation Blue Star. Having recognized the importance of religion as a contributor to will to fight, the Indian Army has organized its force structure, designated sacred leaders, and crafted its policies to best harness the relationship between religion and will to fight to ensure combat effectiveness. Overall, the Indian Army registers many "+" for all the sub-components of the analysis. See Table

The IDF is a formidable military machine that has proven its high will to fight in multiple wars and conflicts waged since the day of its inception. Its high levels of will to fight are supported in no small part by the emphasis it places on the dominant religion, Judaism. Although a secular military by definition, the IDF has actively attempted to encourage enlistment among the ultra-Orthodox segments of Jewish society by promoting an image of adherence to Jewish religious practices through the IDF rabbinate (sacred leaders) and permissive military regulations (policies).
However, the success of these measures has been blunted by the IDF's insistence on heterogeneous units (organization), which continue to disincentivize the ultra-Orthodox from enlisting. To counter this, an encouraging trend is the growing influence of the national-religious Hesder programs, acting as mediating structures between religiously observant soldiers and the IDF. Finally, although the IDF takes pride in its reputation as a people's army, its approach to religious accommodation is generally limited to the religiously observant segments of Jewish society, while the religious needs of non-Jewish soldiers are accorded less of a priority. Overall, the IDF registers several "/" results in an analysis of the variables it has applied. See Table

The US resembles the cases of India and Israel but contains important differences.
Similar to India, it is an expressly secular country in which one religion is dominant (Hinduism in India, Christianity in the US), but religious diversity and religious observance are generally welcome.

Nonetheless, the limitations of the Chaplain Corps to act as a mediating structure in increasing diversity and plurality are mitigated by their ability to galvanize troops on the battlefield and increase disposition to fight. The means through which the Chaplain
Corps achieves this will be discussed in the subsequent section, by expanding the analysis of the US Army's reliance on its Chaplain Corps.
Though chaplains are not unique to the US Army, the extent to which the US Army employs its Chaplain Corps to enhance combat motivation is unparalleled.

In reality, these documents represent the product of a long, ongoing process of negotiating the complicated balance between religious accommodation and military uniformity. The policies regarding religious attire, symbols, and prayer times are tightly controlled in a religiously diverse military like the US, given the need for uniformity in a vast military made up of heterogeneous units.

The Soviet Army represents the danger of taking secularism in militaries to the extreme. Despite being a multi-religious military, the Soviet Army adopted a militant attitude towards religion, and did not organize its units with any consideration for religious affiliations nor did it introduce policies that facilitated religious accommodation. The Soviet Army had no religious sacred leaders but relied heavily on political commissars for unit cohesion which ultimately backfired as soldiers became increasingly disillusioned with Marxist-Leninist ideology.
Ironically, the military victory most glorified by the Soviet regime for its representation of the strength of the people's will was the Great Patriotic War, which corresponded with a relaxation of the religious persecution that the regime had been exacting on the ROC. The Soviet Army's experience thus serves as a cautionary tale to militaries that inadvertently excise religion from the ranks, but also demonstrates that even under the most secular conditions, religion still had a role in building will to fight. See Table 
7
This chapter presented the analysis of how four different armies (Indian Army, the IDF, the US Army, and the Soviet Army) employed the variables of Organization, Leadership, and Policies to manage religious diversity among the ranks. The researcher found that the armies which fostered an enabling religious environment were generally characterized by a high will to fight in most military engagements in the last five decades of the twentieth century; the one military (Soviet Army) that repressed religious expression suffered low will to fight. Each case study also discussed a counterexample in which religion briefly worked against will to fight but subsequently recovered, except for the Soviet Army in which will to fight was improved during a brief period of religious accommodation in World War II. See Table 
8
The research also found that the different armies applied varying blends of organizational, leadership, and policy variables in accordance with the unique context that each military operated in. These included the role religion played in the wider society; whether the military was conscript or volunteer; and whether the military was raised primarily for self-defense or conducted its missions overseas. The results of the analysis and these additional observations will be discussed in the final chapter, in answer of the primary and secondary research questions.
respectively; the first section examining the relationship between organizational, leadership, and policy variables (can), and the second section exploring the relationship between religion and will to fight at the individual, unit, and organizational levels (should). The final section will round off the thesis with suggestions for future research and concluding thoughts.
How can secular militaries create an enabling religious environment?
The case study analyses in Chapter 4 examined militaries that were secular for various reasons: the Indian Army and the US Army due to constitutional obligations enshrined in the governance of a multi-religious population; the IDF due to Judaism's dual functions as a theological religion and as a national identity being interwoven and inextricable; and the Soviet Army due to the USSR's founding Marxist-Leninist ideological tenets. Yet, these militaries (less USSR) represented cases in which they harnessed religion as part of will to fight. All of them had varying approaches to religious accommodation, and they employed different combinations of the three variables thus producing varying outcomes.
Hence, despite the reluctance of secular militaries to create enabling religious environments, this section shows that by answering the primary research question of "how," it suggests that secular militaries actually "can" strike a balance between too much and too little religion in the ranks. This naturally flows into answering the second and third SRQs, which are "What conditions can secular militaries set to foster the practice of religion while remaining secular?" and "How can secular militaries be pluralistic without limiting the practice of religion in the ranks?" The answer to the primary research question and these two SRQs is in the affirmative, in that secular
