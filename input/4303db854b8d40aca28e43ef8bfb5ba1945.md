The three components of geography, time, and experience contributed to a key fourth factor, the development of different national outlooks on war.
With the benefit of no continental peer to challenge its sovereignty and possessing the geographic space to U.S. forces in the Civil War, and inexperience blinded them to the risks assumed by the omission.
Compounding this problem, Prussia was constrained in time to establish and develop the bodies and procedures necessary to regulate and support the railroads adequately.
Neither of its conflicts was of a duration that allowed the systems to mature in the crucible of operations.
Such challenges led to an incomplete application of rail technology in war prosecution, a corresponding assumption of avoidable risks, and a reversion to antiquated and deficient means of support.
Rather than illustrating a developed understanding of modern war, the Prussian use of railroads in its campaigns against Austria and France symbolized an affirmation of its past beliefs.
