At Fontenoy, the muskets needed ammunition, the animals needed fodder, and the soldiers needed food. The side able to source, deliver, and sustain those needs won. For these unquenchable and deadly desires, Lewis
Mumford declared that, "An army is a body of pure consumers."
3
In the three centuries since this long-forgotten battle, has the relationship among technology, logistics, and warfare (i.e. feeding the great consumer) changed? Did technological innovations from the industrial age to the information age-the railroad, the machine gun, artillery, the airplane, the nuclear weapon, the computer, and many more-alter the equation? And, if so, what was the impact on geopolitical dynamics through the aegis of combat power?
To answer these questions a framework is required, consisting of two parts: a typology to describe the vast technological changes since the age of enlightenment and a method to analyze the change within historical context.
To define the technological changes of the past three hundred years in logistics and battle, Lewis Mumford provides a path tread by "the great consumer." In his classic work, Technics and Civilization, Mumford developed three technological eras: Eotechnic, Paleotechnic, and Neotechnic. Although these eras described technology, they were as much about culture as artifacts.
Mumford's components of culture included crucial periods of social "preparation, when all the key inventions were either invented or foreshadowed" and the "existence of certain types of workers." 
4
5
Mumford's first era, the Eotechnic, described the period from 1000-1750.
It was the "dawn age of modern" technology. 
6
7
The Paleotechnic Era, which ran from 1750 to about 1910, was Mumford's evil epoch of the industrial age-belching steam, smoke, and class divisions. Iron was the material and coal was the power source, "Their color spread everywhere from grey to black."
8
9
The Neotechnic Era covered the period from 1910 onward. Electricity provided the power and alloys were the material of the age. 10 Alloys, with their lighter weight and resistance to heat, were the basis of the most archetype technology of this era: the internal combustion engine. In Mumford's words, "Neotechnic transportation awaited this new form of power, in which all the weight should be represented by the fuel itself, instead of carrying, like the steam engine, the additional burden of water."

To analyze technological changes in warfare, and more precisely logistics, five case studies will stand as representatives of Mumford's eras: 1) The campaign for Lake George from 1755-1759 during the Seven Years War in North America; 2) The Western Front in 1917, during the First World War; 3)
The Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942 during the Second World War; 4) The Battle 
11
13
14
of Stalingrad in 1942-43 during the Second World War; and 5) The Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968, during the Vietnam War.
The campaign for Lake George occurred at the apogee of the Eotechnic Era. Many participants on the French and British side had fought at Fontenoy, taking with them the ideas of European war to the wilderness of the New The Holotechnic Era began with the atom as the power source, while information took the place of dominance over physical materials of the previous 
15
eras. Beyond its promise as a source of power, the atom also held the ambitions of the world's great powers at bay-epitomized in the Cold War struggle for supremacy between the United States and the Soviet Union. With the life of the state hostage to another's nation-ending nuclear arsenal, the capability to process large amounts of data was necessary to ensure survival.
According to Antione Bousquet in The Scientific Way of Warfare, "Within this discourse, computers acted as powerful tools and metaphors promising 'total oversight, exacting standards of control, and technical-rational solutions to a myriad of complex problems.'" 
16
In each of these case studies, the logistics of the belligerents were at their limit due to geography or the vast material needs of war. An example of the former, Guadalcanal, was thousands of miles from Japan and the United
States. The Western Front in 1917, the archetype of the latter, required the severe privation of its population during the campaign. As such, the case studies give a good accounting of the logistics for each era and the inflection points between success and failure.
While Mumford's typology provides a classification, the key variable of analysis in each case is the mode of transportation. Transportation is one-half of the equation of logistics and materiel is the other. Moving soldiers, armaments, and supplies forward is the critical link of war-connecting biology and industry with battle. As Winston Churchill said, "Victory is the beautiful, bright-colored flower. Transport is the stem without which it could never have blossomed." 17 At Fontenoy, and for the next 170 years, battle pitted transportation by water against transportation by land. After the invention of powered flight, the airplane also entered the equations of transportation and destruction. For the case studies presented here, the interplay between modes breaks down as follows:
continuities between eras in terms of logistics? 3) What does the campaign tell us about the relationship of technology to logistics and logistics to geopolitics? Said France Bacon in the age of Elizabeth, "He who commands the sea, is at great liberty, and can take as much or as little of the war as he will."

Chapter 1
Lake George is without comparison, the most beautiful water I ever saw; formed by a contour of mountains into a basin . . . finely interspersed with islands, its water limpid as crystal, and the mountain sides covered with rich groves . . . down to the water-edge: here and there precipices of rock to checker the scene and save it from monotony.

-James Kent, 1877
In 1759, painter Thomas Davies was a colonial soldier in the British Army stationed at Lake George commanded by Major General Jeffrey Amherst.
After his experience, he painted the first known portrait of the lake (Figure 
1
In this painting, the waters of Lake George and its steep terrain dominated the scenery. In the foreground, a wide modern road with deep wagon ruts gave way to a clearing containing the 11,000 men of the British Army, which receded to a thick wilderness on the edges of the frame leaving Lake George at the center. The water was calm and pristine while the environs of the lakefrom the shores to the mountaintops-lacked trails, roads, or natural clearings.
The geographical constraints of the steep terrain of the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York populated with heavy forest of pine, birch, and oak were not the only limits to land travel in mid-eighteenth century North America. In an age of water, wind, and wood-boats and ships were far superior in speed and capacity to horses and wagons. As if to underscore the limits of land transportation in the 1750s, Davies painted the wagons as miniature vehicles moving towards the larger boats to unload cargo. While in the foreground a Native American warrior and a Colonial Ranger-of Rogers'
Rangers fame-sit aside the big wagon road. The road, a key line of communication, was the most frequent object of attack for Indian and Ranger raiding parties. In an Eotechnic moment, Thomas Davies captured the bucolic yet harsh reality of travel on Lake George during the Seven Years War in North America-transportation by water was dominant over movement by land. July day in the Adirondacks, it missed the harshness of winter. The first hard-freeze at Lake George happened around October, with the lake frozen by mid-December. The ice remained thick enough to drive heavy sleds over until the end of March. While the ice allowed easy transportation by snowshoe or sled, the weather that accompanied the freeze cut the food supply to the point that the lake was a "shining desert" in winter.

Into this pastoral and brutal environment, the French, British, and their native allies fought for control of Lake George from 1755-1759. The line of troops, weapons, supplies, food, and strategic communication flowed from Europe west over the Atlantic Ocean, was augmented with colonial support, and followed two converging paths. For the French, the water passage flowed past Fort Havre Louisbourg into the St. Lawrence River, east of Montreal the route turned south and followed Lake Champlain to Fort Saint-Frédéric, which stood ten miles north of the peninsula the Native Americans called Ticonderoga. From Ticonderoga, a short and steep portage of a mile led to the north end of Lake George. 
2

there, a long portage of 17 miles ended at the southern bank of Lake George (See Figure 
1
Lake George, with the addition of Lake Champlain, the Hudson River, the Mohawk River, and the Great Lakes made Colonial New York a road to war for Native American tribes, earning the moniker of "The Great Warpath." 
3
From 1755 to 1759, control of the lake seesawed between the French and British, and their native allies. More than 50,000 soldiers and warriors participated in four major battles, dozens of minor skirmishes, and hundreds of small raids and individual acts of violence. Added to the men needed to fight the war were the impressive logistics needed to sustain battle at the edge of civilization-food, cannon, muskets, boats, wagons, timber for forts, and countless other supplies.
In an assessment of the weight of economic might available to buttress the material forces of war from 1755-1759, the English Colonies dwarfed French Canada. In 1755, the British Plantations General reported 1,062,000 whites in the colonies, of which 152,000 were either attached to a militia or available for military service.

Why then, with such material advantage did it require five years for the British to gain control of Lake George? From the perspective of logistics, the key lies in the modes of transportation, dictated by geography, that both sides used. The French and their larger contingent of Native Allies had internal lines of communication built on well-fortified waterways flowing from New France to Lake George, while the British had to move overland from the Hudson River to the lake.

The campaign for Lake George campaign was at the heart of the global competition between the Duke of Newcastle's British government and Louis the XV, the King of France. Although the battle for the lake began in 1755, its origins were much earlier. From the mid-seventeenth century onward, the English colonies began to spread westward from the seaboard to the Appalachians and towards the Ohio River Valley, encroaching on the territories of French Canada and those tribes aligned with them. As these contested areas became associated with the race for global empire, French and British colonists increasingly fought wars associated with European conflicts.
From 1689 to the 1740s, the British and French fought King Williams
War, Queen Anne's War, and King George's War in North America. These paralleled the Nine Years War, the War of Spanish Succession, and the War of William Johnson would take a force of colonial troops and move from Albany, New York, alight upon Lake George, row north, and take Crown Point, which the French called Fort St.-Frédéric. Once the British controlled Crown Point, they could in turn control Lake Champlain (See Figure

While Braddock led British efforts in the colonies, Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil de Cavagnial, Canadian-born son of a past governor, led the French in North America. Braddock's chain of command included the Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, and the head of the British Army, the Duke of Cumberland.

However political and bureaucratic the British system was, its extensive victualing, supply, and shipping system begat a consistent amount of combat troops and material for the war effort. Vaudreuil, on the other hand, suffered from poor logistics support. This was especially true after 1756 when the Seven Years War began in earnest in Europe and Louis XV turned his attention east, making Canada a low strategic priority.
12 Gilles Harvard, "'Protection' and 'Unequal Alliance': The French Conception of Sovereignty over Indians in New France," ed. Robert Englebert and Guillaume Teasdale, French and Indians in the Heart of North America, 1630-1815 (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press; University of Manitoba Press, 2013). 114. The French were often the communication vessel for one tribe to speak to another and given the small size of the French population, French leaders were often at the mercy of tribal demands. Although the Native Americans often invoked patriarchal language to describe French leaders, the relationship "relied on considerations (menagments)-in other words, strategic accommodation."
The perfection of their drill gave European armies [in the eighteenth century] unique formidability and flexibility at short range and for a few hours of battle . . . But at longer range . . . available transport simply could not concentrate enough food to support thousands of horses and men if they kept on the move day after day.
-William H. McNeill, The Pursuit of Power
As the Seven Years War in North America traced its origins to Europe and the global competition between France and Britain, so did the campaign for Lake George follow from the aforementioned Battle of Fontenoy. Most of the key military officers who fought at Lake George had faced each other at Fontenoy a decade prior. 
13
In Supplying War, Martin Van Creveld sums up the attitude towards warfare and logistics during the eighteenth century, "The whole concept of supply from base was contrary to the spirit of the age, which always insisted that war be waged as cheaply as possible-an age, indeed, when wars could be

launched for the sole purpose of making the army live at ones' neighbour's expense rather than one's own." 
14
In turn, the scouting for forage areas, food, and lodging took on an important role in eighteenth century European warfare-hence the infamous "Hussars" of Frederick the Great who ranged for forage and food for the Prussian Army. 
15
16
Facing off against the European images of logistics were the North American wilderness and the musket. Unlike the armies at Fontenoy, which could depend on the local countryside to supply them with some manner of subsistence, the wilds of North America offered no such support. Armies had to bring supplies forward or take them from a defeated foe. In an isolated location such as Lake George, the logistics train, whether over land or water, 
14
15
16
gained foremost strategic importance because the line of supply was often the sole means to hold off starvation and defeat.
These strategic supply trains were at the mercy of the musket. The musket of the eighteenth century, even with a limited range of 125 yards, was deadly to massed formations in areas of open ground. 17 A wagon train with its methodical movement represented a similar massed-formation target in the steep terrain and wooded areas surrounding the roads of Colonial North America, which hid attackers while highlighting the wooden vehicles. With much of their men and material having to move over land from the colonial cities to the contested regions of the conflict, British supply lines were under greater risk of attack than those of the water-borne French.
Besides the threat the musket posed for land-borne transportation, the weapon was a critical component of the mobile warfare of the Native Americans. The introduction of the musket to native tribes by the French Explorer Champlain in 1609 in a confrontation with the Iroquois' near Ticonderoga at the north end of Lake George, transformed warfare in North America. Before this small battle, native warfare in Northeastern North America followed the warfare of medieval European armies-mass armies with spears, shields, and arrows facing off to claim territorial grounds. 
18
18
These methods were well suited to the narrow, steep, and wooded geography of North America.
While the Europeans brought musket technology to the Native Americans, the tribes would teach the Europeans the effectiveness of rapid movement in the wilderness. Accustomed to centuries of far-ranging hunting and warfare, native warring parties had a much smaller logistical tail than any European Army. Warriors could travel more than 50 miles a day and subsist on little more than acorns and meat from smaller mammals, such as squirrels or skunks. 
19
Rangers-that mimicked native raiding methods, but in general preferred their Redcoats and the requisite requirements for supply and transportation. Thus, the campaign for Lake George would be a test of Nathaniel Bedford Forrest's
Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766, 12. Champlain and three of his French companions fired into a massed formation of Iroquois warriors who had drawn their bows and spears to attack, and killed three of their chiefs. With this action, Champlain cemented animosity between the French and the Iroquois that remained until France no longer controlled Canada-framing a future battle lines for the campaigns around Lake George.

The campaign for Lake George began with Major General Edward   Braddock's march to take Fort Duquesne from the French in 1755 (See Figures 1.3 and 1.4 below). In February, Braddock sailed into Williamsburg, Virginia from England. The general took command and, through sheer force of will, impelled the colonies to support his operation with labor, supplies, and money.

-Benjamin Franklin, April 1755
For his land campaign, Braddock needed wagons to carry his army's food and war supplies and the horses to pull them. Early in the spring of 1755, St.
Clair promised Braddock that 200 wagons and associated equine transportation numbering 1,500 horses could be obtained from the area around Fort Cumberland, specifically from Dutch and German settlers. 
25
26
In contrast to the other colonies reluctance to act, Benjamin Franklin sent out a notice to Pennsylvanians, and quickly had the wagons and drivers amassing at Fort Cumberland.

The correspondence of Braddock, orderly logs for the campaign, and the correspondence of his aide-de-camps Lieutenant George Washington and Captain Orme, illustrate the urgency of Braddock's requests and the difficult progress in getting the wagons. George Washington mentions the want of horses or wagons 14 out of the 27 of his correspondences from 11 May to 7 June 1755.

Constructing a Conestoga wagon took significant effort. The lumber required four years of seasoning before any construction began. In addition, there was significant lathing and iron plate assembly needed to attach the wheels.

As the General gathered his transportation and forces at Fort Cumberland, he realized he had a food shortage. His first two days in camp focused on settling accounts related to food, ammunition, and the proper accounting of supplies.

Braddock ordered several dozen men to encamp near a forage area for the cavalry horses-a day's journey by foot from Fort 
Cumberland. 37
Despite these trials of logistics, 3200 men and more than 1500 horses had made it to Fort Cumberland by May. With this initial success, Braddock,
St. Clair, and many colonial leaders grew more optimistic. Surveying the army at the remote output, Robert Dinwiddie, the governor of Virginia, wrote to Braddock, "I have no doubt the French will surrender on Sight of y'r Forces."

In a foreshadowing of difficulty, St. Clair's force moved less than two miles on 30 May 1755 climbing out of the environs of Fort Cumberland.
Captain Orme, Braddock's aide-de-camp, stated, "The ascent and descent were almost a perpendicular rock; three wagons were entirely destroyed, which were replaced from the camp; and many more were extremely shattered."

From the first perilous movement out of Fort Cumberland, St. Clair and Braddock began to change their army from fighting force to road-building machine. All infantry, artillery, or marine-specific jobs transformed into those of road builder, food supplier, or picket to move, sustain, and protect the convoy from attack. Braddock ordered officers' to release their best horses for Beyond the concentrated flora, the hills and embankments were steep with significant rises in terrain over short distances.
St. Clair summed up the difficulties from his depot station on 12 June 1755, "The situation I am in at present puts it out of my power to give you a full description of this country [emphasis added] . . . tho our motions may appear to you to have been slow, yet I may venture to assure you that not an Hour has been lost . . . The little knowledge that our People at home have of carrying on War in a Mountaneous Country will make the expence of our carriages appear very great to them, that one Article will amount near to £40,000 stir."

As the food supplies dwindled, the average solider began to go hungry.
Following the privation in the opposition direction, the prices on goods bought and sold in camp rose as much as 300 percent. An anonymous chaplain remarked, "Rum 20s a Gallon, the worst brown Sugar 4s a Pound, a Year old Calf sold . . . at 3 [Pounds] . . . after the 25th of June a Dollar for a Pint of Rum, so you may judge of our Distress: The whole Country is a Wood."

Buchet lists the highest amount the British paid for cow beef at 26 shillings per hundredweight in 1756. Hind et al. set the weight of a full-grown cow at 369 pounds in 1732. 80 pounds is an extrapolation of the 5-year full weight down to a one-year calf.

55
After 20 days of painstaking movement, with a dire but not deadly food situation, Braddock received word from his small contingent of native allies that French reinforcements would soon arrive at Fort Duquesne. With this new intelligence, Braddock decided to send a "flying column" of infantry troops armed with minimal provisions and the thirty wagons necessary to move the artillery forward. 
56
The Marquis De Vaudreuil, aware of Braddock's preparations all spring, ordered Captain Daniel-Hyacinthe Marie Lienard de Beaujeu and 240 French soldiers of European and colonial service from Montreal to intercept the British.

Although he left much sooner than Braddock, he had to travel five times the distance of the British march-more than 700 miles.

Between 600 and 700 warriors joined Beaujeu at Fort Duquesne on 2 July 1755, one week before Braddock's arrival.

Besides travelling light and fast and conjuring their allies from the far corners of their dominion, the French also had possession of the fort.
Compared to Braddock and the British, they had a 146-year head start on the establishment of forts beyond the Appalachians in North America. These forts formed refueling outposts and protection in the wilds of North America. In addition, the forts established critical communication nodes with Native 58 Ibid.,

62
American allies, allowing the French to promulgate Catholicism, trade for fur, and call for military help when necessary. At the key intersection of the Ohio, Alleghany, and Monongahela River, Fort Duquesne fulfilled this task and thus became the object of Braddock's march. What the French lacked in firepower they made up in speed and possession. The French and Native Americans encircled the British and fired from the hillsides surrounding the column for several hours, mortally wounding
Braddock and sending the British from the field in disarray. Although the British had artillery and fired almost 100 shells during the battle, the French 63 Ibid., 99.

gained a lopsided victory from their advantageous position behind elevated cover. The French-led force inflicted 877 casualties on the British while losing only 44. 
65
66
As the beaten British scrambled back to Colonel Dunbar's position, they discarded every piece of equipment they could. A dying Braddock ordered the destruction of as much British firepower and equipment as possible to lighten the load and hasten the retreat. Captain Thomas Ord, the artillery officer, dutifully recorded the demolition. At the start of battle, the British had 29
Artillery pieces-ranging from 12-and-6-pound cannons to 8-inch Howitzers and several mortars. The French took 13 pieces in the battle, while Braddock ordered the jettisoning of eight more pieces, which left the British with four 6pound cannon and four mortars. 
67
Johnson was to put his cannons at "the Rockey Eminence" of Ticonderoga, aim at Crown Point, and demand French capitulation. 
86
Through the late spring, Johnson hammered his vague directions into an operational plan. As part of the plan, Johnson decided to assemble his army in Albany from several colonies including Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, then move up the Hudson River to "The Great Carrying
Place."

His force left Fort Edward and followed an old hunting trail along a natural path between the steep hills of the southern Adirondacks. The journey took two days to traverse the 17 miles as the colonial soldiers slowly widened the path to the lake. The road was passable, but the journey was difficult.
Johnson had wagon drivers threaten to leave the columns due to the rugged nature of the road and fear of attack by French and native raiding parties. 117
In addition, the rough course caused supply wagons to spill and Johnson begged Lyman to use utmost care on future resupply missions.

During this time, the British relieved Shirley of command and replaced him with the John Campbell, the 4th Earl of Loudon, in March 1756.

In addition, their ability to adapt eating habits to the immediacy of the Harnessing their quick-strike and long-ranging abilities, Vaudreuil and Montcalm used the Indian warriors to great effect to attack the British at Lake George. However, alliances with Native Americans came at great cost. While they required little food or supply on campaign, coaxing them to fight often took many guns, wampum belts, and European trade goods. 
169
While the Native Americans were fast, they lacked the European cultural maxims of territorial control. Native Americans tied the value of land to the sustainment of life, rather than ownership. 
170
171
Since the French relied heavily on native warriors to supplement their armies, permanent gains against British positions were fleeting.
This did not mean that native raids were ineffective. The threat of raids by Native Americans on supply lines and settlements invoked a great reaction from the British. In response to Native American raids from 1755 to 1757, the British built forts "every two leagues" from Fort William Henry to Albany. 172
These forts at Saratoga, Stillwater, Fort Anne, and Half-Way Brook, gave the British protection from raids and respite for horses and men as they moved supplies by wagons.

With abundant trees and moving water, these regions had the ingredients necessary for the manufacture of lumber. According to a historian of the American forest, the mills were the first buildings erected in a town and "no mills meant no people." 175 While Western Europe had long been devoid of forests, the greatest concentration of trees and sawmills in the world existed in colonial America. 
176
177
Besides forts, the British also began to adapt their own striking force to attack the French lines of supply.  
In 1757, with Fort Oswego in his control and the land routes to the Ohio River and Fort Niagara safe, Vaudreuil fixated on Lake George and directed Montcalm to lay siege to Fort William Henry that summer. Though the French held the advantage in the war thus far, their supplies and manpower began to dwindle by 1757. Montcalm and his superior both clamored for more supplies.

The oldest soldiers present never saw so furious and incessant a fire. The affair of Fontenoy was nothing to it; I saw both.
-Lieutenant William Grant, British Grenadier On the morning of 5 July 1758, the biggest army fielded during the French and Indian War alighted upon on the clear, calm waters of Lake George.
Composing 44 pieces of artillery, more than 1,150 boats, and 15,391 men, the armada was more than eight miles in length and three miles in width.

Abercromby's force spent the night 24 miles down the lake at Sabbath Day Point, and proceeded to Ticonderoga point on 7 July 1755. The British With Howe flying up and away from the main body to catch the French piquets and meeting his death, the large body of troops behind him became hopelessly confused in the dark, swampy, tree-lined floor of the forest. The sound of Howe's troops fighting the French for the less-than-10-minute engagement further confused the army. Some units tried to move towards the sound of battle, while others moved away from it. In the disorder, many soldiers dropped provisions.

With this stroke, Abercromby solved five challenges for the British at Lake George. First, he eliminated any need to resupply the fort through the narrow road from Fort Edward, which made an inviting target for ambush.
Second, he cut out the need to occupy a fort, further subjecting his troops to disease. Third, he kept the boats from being stolen by the French or unallied native tribes. Under the water and eventually ice, the French could not reach the boats. Fourth, there would be no need to transport boats over rough roads to the south, freeing precious space in wagons for other uses. Finally, the sinking of the boats applied pressure to the wood planks, which helped seal the joints. With sealed joints, set in ice over winter, boats were less susceptible to leaks and required less caulk, reducing the logistics burden for the next campaign.

Operations in North America, he brought a vast experience of combat and logistics. Amherst also had wide experience in Europe, ranging from commanding an infantry regiment at Fontenoy in 1747, to the supply of the British Army in Hannover buttressing Frederick the Great's western flank in 1757. 
249
250
While Amherst prepared for the campaign at Lake George, the French were in crisis. With the collapse of Louisbourg, the tenuous supply line from
France was now little more than a smuggling route and Quebec was open to invasion. In addition, the smallpox that the western tribes had contracted at Fort William Henry in 1757 had spread to the far west of the environs of French North America. 
251
With French weakness and limited access to the waterways, Amherst's campaign across Lake George to Crown Point was anti-climactic.
As Amherst prepared to take Crown Point in the summer of 1759, the British again upgraded the supply network from Albany to Lake George. For example, Amherst travelled from Albany to Lake George in just two days. Although he was moving only by horse and without a baggage train to inspect the lake, his quick journey illustrates how far the line of communication over land had advanced since 1755.
On 3 June 1759, Amherst left Albany to observe the transportation of supplies, men, and bateaux to the south end of Lake George. The general involved himself in every detail of the preparation from moving the army to Lake George, to sending out work parties to widen the roads in places and repairing broken wagons. 
253
Amherst first charged his men to raise the boats out of the water. On the 23rd and 24th of June, the British army brought up 232 bateaux and 91 whaleboats. 
254
255
While Abercromby had left the direction of the camp to Brigadier General Howe, Amherst put a higher level of personal energy into getting the army ready. Where Abercromby busied himself solely with loading the boats for the last few days, Amherst's army felled trees for a field hospital, sent more men out to work on the road back to Fort Edward, and set the rest to work on rebuilding a fort near the ruins of Fort William Henry while also loading the boats.

Amherst first had his men build a sawmill to construct the bigger boats necessary to take control of Lake Champlain and bolster the works of the fort at Crown Point. The enormous undertaking kept the troops busy until Amherst ended the campaign in late October. 
266
While historians criticize Amherst for his slow methodical nature, he also understood how to conduct warfare given his tenuous supply lines. 
267
In this Eotechnic Era, land transportation could not compete with water transportation. The difficulties of Braddock's 110-mile trek with 3,000 soldiers to Fort Duquesne stands in stark contrast with to Montcalm's conjuring of an army of more than 6,500 allies, from as far west as Lake Michigan, to converge on Lake George using vast waterways of the Old Northwest.
Even the much smaller 17-mile portage from Fort Edward to Lake George proved a tough task for land transportation. In 1755, with a chaotic ramble of wagons, bateaux, Native Americans, untrained colonial soldiers, a single British officer, and cannon, Sir William Johnson paved the first supply path from Albany to the lake. In a proto-example of what modern military forces label "hub and spoke"-Johnson built up a major supply center, provided proper protection, and transported logistics to Lake George to construct Fort William Henry. More than 30,000 British soldiers and Colonial militia followed in his path.
By establishing lines of communication overland, the British built something anathema to European logistics: an "umbilical line of supply" that relied on internal funding to buttress wartime needs rather than living off an invaded region, as at battles such as Fontenoy. 
270
Braddock's wagons, the series of forts from Albany to Fort William Henry on Lake George, and the thousands of bateaux for movement on the water, were consumptive of labor and treasure. Thus, even though the British had sawmills and a colonial culture based on timber, the technology was insufficient to overcome the advantages of water transportation in terms of speed and cost. Nowhere was the technological advantage more apparent than the differences between the bespoke Conestoga wagon, which moved less than three miles an hour, and the simply-made bateau, which travelled as fast as the current flowed. After their defeat in 1758, Abercromby and the British acknowledged by action the superiority of water transportation and sunk their navy into Lake George. The British could not hold the line of communication over the winter of 1758 without great expense. Clearly, the input of large sums of money to support the needs of logistics overland by William Pitt after 1758 was a key ingredient to British success.
For the British, land transportation was a cruel twist of Mandelbrot's "Lindy Effect" of fractal mathematics-a power law that postulates the longer something exists, the longer it will exist. 271 For General Braddock, the longer his army took get to Fort Duquesne, the more the difficulty multiplied. The slower his army moved, the more it consumed the provisions in the wagons; thereby requiring resupply, which lengthened the journey. Johnson suffered from a similar situation. Food delivered over the rough road to Lake George, took up precious wagon cargo space needed to move other war goods-notably 
271
the bateaux. For each day Johnson's army stayed at Lake George, more provisions were needed, which diminished cargo available for the offensive towards Crown Point. Abercromby faced the same challenge in 1758. Only with the abandonment of the fort and sinking of the boats were the British able to lessen their dependence on the inefficient line of communication from
Albany to Lake George.
The French also had difficulty moving by land. Dieskau and Montcalm could fight a battle for a week's time, plunder, and retreat, but their movement stopped at the water's edge. Dieskau's army possessed only the food that could fit in canoes and was starving after ten days of paddling to the Battle of Lake George and back. In 1757, despite an overwhelming victory and the British in full retreat, Montcalm lacked the wagons on which to load his cannons and attack Fort Edward.
Moving between land and water modes of transportation or vice-versa posed great challenges for both sides. In the aforementioned cases, the French lacked the resources to change modes. On the opposite case, the British had to build up logistics first, move on to the water, row or paddle, and finally move off the water again at the north end of Lake George. As illustrated by Abercromby's failure and Amherst's success, planning for the transition from land to water, or in reverse, was critical.
In addition, the interruption of supply routes via raiding parties, especially by the French and their native allies, was an irritant but not sufficient to win the campaign. While French raiding parties did not win the war, they caused the British to expend much treasure and labor getting to Lake George. On the other side, Rogers Rangers were a distraction, rather than a strategic threat, to French operations.
Despite their material and vast advantage in population, the British had Although transportation by water allowed the French to hold off a more populous and wealthy enemy for five years, the French reliance on the waterways during the campaign for Lake George doomed them. Ted Ropp, in War in the Modern World, highlights the unique nature of water transportation in North American warfare. He declares the Civil War was "the last of the Great Wars for North America, in which the power which commanded the sea defeated a people who were too dependent on water transportation." 
272
272
their enemy, the French required supplies and food from France. In turn, the British command of the seas choked the French source of supply and won, where the British efforts to attack from the land onto the water at Lake George stalled. In the end, only the "mostest" of the British land transportation network from Albany buttressed by the command of the sea of the British Navy overcame the "fustest" of the French. Geopolitical Impact-Lake George (Eotechnic Era)
The need to pay for the Seven Years War in North America, much of it spent on expensive transportation by land, drove a political wedge between the British Crown and its colonies. After the war, the British tried to make the colonies pay for the victory and their own security; Parliament passed the Stamp Act of 1765, the Quartering Act of 1765, and the Townshend duties of 1767 to finance the debt of war.

When the governor of New Hampshire tried to enforce the law in 1772, colonists severely beat the local sheriff and his assistant, who came to collect fines during the "Pine Tree Revolt." 275 By 1775, with increased levies and restrictions on economic activity, the colonists began to see themselves as a nation apart and started armed rebellion against the crown. Thus, the costs of logistics on land cost the British their colonies.
During the American Revolution, following the wake of their French enemy, the British had their dependency on water transportation turned against them. The British relied on their transportation over the oceans and rivers as a critical part of their operational strategy. From their first sail out of Boston to avoid colonial siege in 1776 to their final defeat at Yorktown, the  The relationship between lines of communication over water and land, as at Lake George, underwrote this transformation of the geopolitical landscape.
Thus, the answer to the great question of logistics on the Western Front On the Western Front, the British had more horses and soldiers devoted to this  Associated Powers (1914-1920), 2 vols., vol. 1 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1924), 352.
"last tactical mile" of transportation than the rail-savvy Germans, but both sides relied on methods from a bygone era for final movement.
The Paleotechnic Era bequeathed the same exponential improvements to battlefield firepower as it had to transportation. By 1917, the machine gun and the artillery shell had expanded killing power on the battlefield and across the water. While the musket at Lake George had a kinetic reach of 125 yards and its companion cannon ranged 1500 yards, the machine gun had a range of 2200 yards and standard-sized artillery flung projectiles 7500 yards. The rate of fire quickened from a few times a minute in the eighteenth century to 1,000 times a minute for a machine gun on the Western Front in 1917.

In addition to iron, carbon, and steam that powered weapons and vehicles on the Western Front, the internal combustion engine of the nascent Neotechnic Era made its debut.

Never, I believe, did a country so thoroughly get ready for war. I saw the oddest spectacle, the building of a railway behind a battlefield. They had diminutive little engines and rails in sections, so that they could be bolted together, and even bridges that could be put across ravines in a twinkling. Flat cars that could be carried by hand and dropped on the rails, great strings of them.
Up to the nearest point of battle came, on the regular railway, this small one . . . It seemed to me that hundreds of men had been trained for this task, for in but a few minutes that small portable train was buzzing backward and forward on its own small portable rails, distributing food and supplies. . . . I've an idea that in time of battle it would be possible for those sturdy little trains to shift troops to critical or endangered points at the rate of perhaps twenty miles an hour. . . . A portable railway for a battlefield struck me as coming about as close to making war by machinery as anything I have ever heard of.

Responding in-kind to the German developments of the late nineteenth century, the French military reorganized their transportation system first by committee, and then by the "creation under the law of March 13, 1875, of Field Railway Sections and Railway Troops." 14 As a result, the French were ready for their own mobilization by rail in 1914.

The Government, the Reichstag, and a great part of the population had never yet understood the character of modern warfare, which lays claim upon all one's resources, nor had they ever realized the importance to ultimate victory of their full cooperation in the fight.

These economic privations caused the German strategy to be one of defense on the Western Front in 1917, hoping to knock out their weak opponent to the east first. 38 Despite Ludendorff's frustration in hindsight, the German population was all-in for the war effort.
In the fall of 1916, with severe shortages of transportation, artillery shells, and food due to stalemated trench warfare and the allied naval blockade, Germany reorganized its economy under both the Hindenburg and Auxiliary Laws. With the Hindenburg Laws, the Chief of the Army, General

eventually Lloyd George was keenly aware of the impact of the war on society. 
49
As with Germany, the drive to reshape the economy for industrial war had political ramifications for Britain. Rather than push British polity towards military rule, Lloyd George's success in revamping the munitions industry was the crucial factor in his advancement. To solve the munitions crisis, Lloyd
George reached out to industry for men of "push and pull" who would ignore standard convention. 
While Germany and the British reworked their economies to support the war effort, France tried to recover. The Pyrrhic victory at Verdun had cost the French 377,321 lives, the battle combined with the Somme to account for 579,798 casualties in 1916.

The British and Germans: Unrestricted Submarine Warfare
The British continued their dominance of the sea-lanes until 1917. As a result, their supplies and soldiers moved unimpeded from Britain and onto the Western Front. Britain's navy kept the global shipping afloat while holding the German capital ships in their ports. 54 This is not to say that the German Uboats did not have some success. In the first half of 1915, they sank more than 300 vessels, representing 800,000 tons of shipping.

56
After the winter of 1916-17, when the British sea blockade had reduced the Germans to eating turnips, the debate within German political-military circles turned to the use of the submarine-American entry into the war be damned. In addition to the Hindenburg program and the Auxiliary Laws, the decision to turn the U-boat force loose on the seas reflected the German state's move to total war. 
57
On 9 January 1917, Bethmann-Hollweg, with the concurrence of the
Wilhelm II, approved the campaign. 
58
In order to bolster this thesis, the Germans used detailed statistical analysis, newspaper reports, and the Lloyd's of London Ships Registry. German naval planners estimated they could bring Britain's imports-wheat the most important target-to a standstill by August if the U-boats could sink an average of 600,000 tons per month.

The whole system of defense had to be made broader and looser and better adapted to the ground. The large, thick barriers of wire, pleasant as they were when there was little doing, were no longer a protection. They withered under the enemy barrage. Light strands of wire, difficult to see, were much more useful. Forward infantry positions with a wide field of fire were easily seen by the enemy.
They could be destroyed by the artillery of the enemy, and were very difficult to protect by our own artillery. Positions farther back, with a narrower firing filed and more under the protection of our own guns, were retained. They were of special service in big fights." 62

While the success of Lloyd George in producing massive numbers of munitions was the proximate cause of the difficulties of transportation the British suffered in late 1916, many of their problems originated before 1914.
Before the war, the British and French negotiated a supply-and-transportation network. In this agreement, British cargo and men would move across the English channels to ports in France, forward to supply depots, and then to the front following a simple path (See Figure

Nivelle's plan-called the Nivelle Offensives-required much of the Entente's logistics support. With the change in strategy, the British logistics system lacked the agility, while being recast by Geddes and the British army, to deliver the artillery pieces necessary to the proper locations near Arras. 
98
99
In February 1917, as the Allies were debating their strategy, the Germans moved back to the Hindenburg line. This forced a change in the operational plan for Nivelle. When the allies learned that the Germans had retreated across the front in early March, they realized that the region they hoped to capture in battle was bequeathed to them as a "no-man's land."
Repairing roads and rebuilding rail lines into the new salient would take too long.

Although a qualified success, the British did not break the code of maneuver warfare at Arras. Movement by rail had limits. Railroads took time to construct, and though they followed the offensive, it was difficult. The wet and cold conditions in April 1917, coupled with unimpeded German rail made it more difficult. On 12 April, Haig wrote:
Great efforts were made to bring forward guns, and, in spite of the difficulties presented by weather and ground, several batteries . . . reached position in rear of the old German line . . . Our advance had now reached a point at which the difficulty of maintaining communications and providing adequate artillery support for our infantry began seriously to limit our progress. Moreover, the enemy had had time to bring up reserves and to recover from the temporary disorganization caused by our first attacks. 112  (Reprinted with permission from the National Library of Scotland "51B.

Although it was a limited success and cost the British 16,000 casualties, it was the most significant movement on the Western Front by the Entente in two years of fighting. As the Germans had learned in Austria and at Sedan in the previous century, the British realized the need to build railroads as the offensive moved.

And, strong as the soul often is, it can not dominate the body to the point where there will not be a revolt of the flesh and mental perturbation in the face of destruction The efforts of the French and British at Arras proved two things to the Germans. First, the new strategy of defense on the Western Front worked.

-British Admiral Jellicoe, in response to the U-boat threat, May 1917
By mid-1917, the war on the seas seemed to favor the Germans.
Although based only on their early projections of U-boat destruction, not necessarily what the British could withstand, the increasing tonnage sunk and their holding of the Western Front after the Nivelle offensives gave Hindenburg and Ludendorff hope (See Table

122
Bethmann-Hollweg in an interview after the war stated, "Whatever happened, for 1917 we could not hope for a victory, either on land or at sea, which would mean a final decision . . . The conviction that the U-boat campaign would not bring England to her knees penetrated even into those circles which had cradled themselves in such a belief." 123 Even Kaiser Wilhelm II, an ardent supporter of the war had grown more passive by

All told, the Germans moved in 67 fresh divisions to the area surrounding Ypres and rotated out 51 battle-tired divisions from July to November.

Arrangements were made to send a section of the battery forward by railway, but later on it appears improbable that the battery will move. Orders again canceled and one section ordered to move forward to the new position. 8 October-One gun taken out of action at Zillebeke and then taken down to Reninghelst to be entrained and run up on Decauville to new position. Another gun was made ready to be sent to the same position. This seems an extraordinary move. Reninghelst was several miles behind the battery position! 9 October-The 2nd gun for the new position was dispatched on the road at 5.30pm. 10 October-The gun had arrived at the new position, but owing to congestion on the railway could not be mounted.

As the campaign ground on in fall of 1917, the U-boat threat became a lesser problem for the British. What had so concerned Jellicoe in June was a minor footnote by October.

The Changes to the BEF's transportation system at the end of 1916 put the administration in a position where it could begin to have confidence in its ability to supply all reasonable (and even unreasonable) needs.
-Ian Malcom Brown, British Logistics on the Western Front: 1914-1918   The campaign in the west which the year 1918 will bring is the most colossal military problem which has ever been set to any army, a problem which the Even more interesting than the rise of land transportation to rival sea, was how Paleotechnic and Neotechnic technologies allowed belligerents to compete for the control of lines of communication, which were not their natural strengths. The Germans, a very recent naval power, used the submarine to threaten the basis of British power projection since eighteenth century-sea lines of communication. In turn, this threat influenced the operational strategy that the British pursued on the Western Front, with the capture of the German submarine pens becoming a priority and shifting their fight to Flanders. In turn, the British were able to use command of the sea to deliver their supplies and equipment necessary to become a localized rail power in Europe and attack the Germans in four separate instances, delivering millions of men and thousands of guns to the front. In 1917, the world's great sea power became great rail power.
As at Lake George, the transition between modes of transportation proved challenging. The improvements the British made in their ability to produce more munitions at home, overwhelmed the ports and the transportation network in France. Much as Albany was overwhelmed in 1755, so were the ports of France in later 1916 and early 1917-coping with the munitions and supplies of a British economy on a full wartime footing. Sir Eric Geddes, using specialized knowledge of global transportation, revamped British logistics from a system suited to supply an army in 1755 to one that could compete in artillery war of the industrial age on the Western Front. Much like Albany, it took the proper network of supply and transportation to ensure the delivery of needs of war and balancing logistics between the undesirables of "too much too soon" and "too little too late." His success allowed the British to have the supplies and men necessary for the offensives of 1917, which they executed solo as their French ally licked its wounds.
On the Western Front in 1917, the war was also about sustenance as it had been at Lake George. At the tactical level, the British offensives stalled, at least in small part, due to the limitations of the human body, with men growing In Germany, the intoxication of almost winning was as bad as defeat.
For many Germans, including a trench runner named Adolf Hitler, who had been on the Western Front at the time of surrender, it was not the army which surrendered but the home front-the infamous Dolchstoßlegende or "Stab in

the Back" myth. While the propaganda of the National Socialists proclaimed that Jews, Marxists, and Cultural Bolsheviks caused the capitulation of 1918, in private, the leadership of the Third Reich believed the privations of home broke the will of the Germans. In the Second World War, this led to a perverse system of logistics to follow their corrupt ideology-one in which the nation was The Solomons: Japan, America, and Technology in the Neotechnic Era
The exigencies of the Neotechnic world demanded that world powers master the resources underpinning the technologies of transportation and war.
Oil was the most important recourse. It provided fuel for the internal combustion engine-cars, tanks, airplanes, ships, and all manner of motive transportation. Although many combatants of the Second World War were resource-constrained, Japan and Italy suffered the most acutely. As a result, rather than projecting power from its industrial base outward via a line of communication, Japan had to project power to obtain resources. For Japan, an island nation with ambitions for power in the Pacific region, the war would always be about two intertwined issues: resources and China.

The Marines landing at Tulagi faced some resistance, but they sustained only a few casualties on the beaches.

Japanese sailors at the small naval base at Tulagi, which harbored seaplanes and submarines, sent a quick dispatch back to Rabaul-the Americans had landed. Admiral Yamamoto, commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), directed an immediate response, and his commanders in the field wasted no time in execution.

As the Japanese planes alighted for their bombing runs and the lead units of Marines moved off the beach, the unloading situation at Red Beach turned chaotic. To assist with the movement on to the beach and then forward, marine planners had assigned 300 personnel from the 1st Pioneer Battalion to orchestrate the unloading.

were not enough personnel to assist. In addition, since many of the landing craft lacked ramps-thus men had to reach over the sides to move cargo-the unloading of the boats took significant labor away from the logistics of moving the supplies off the beach. 
25
With the beach full, there was no way to move water or any other provisions forward to the Marines making their way through the jungle towards the Japanese airfield. From the rails of the transport ships, Guadalcanal appeared as a tropical postcard-calm waves, breezes, and palm trees. As the Marines moved ashore they discovered the opposite, Guadalcanal was "a hot humid hell-hole.

This famous analysis, completed at the US Naval War College with the help of Imperial Japanese Navy Captain Ohmae states, "It is easy to say, now, that the enemy transports should have been attacked at all cost. There is now little doubt that it would have been worthwhile for Chokai to have turned back, even alone, ordering such of her scattered ships as could to follow her in an attack on the enemy transports. And, if all had followed and all had been sacrificed in sinking the transports, it would have been well worth the price to effect the expulsion of the enemy from Guadalcanal."

served a valuable fighting asset in the waters around the island and provided needed logistics support-everything from getting cargo to the beach, to picking up downed aviators.
The initial difficulty in supply for Guadalcanal, the mess at the Port of Nouméa, and the distance away from the conflict began to wear on Ghormley. 
The final stage of the Japanese response to the marine landings was the counter-landing of Japanese reinforcement to eject the Marines via land battle.
As part of this operation, the Imperial Headquarters ordered local army commander Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake to move several battalions' worth of men to Guadalcanal, a scant amount given the 15,000

Marines and navy personnel sitting on the two islands.

While the US Navy had trouble with radar blips, the Japanese had trouble with the radio. When the Americans scattered the Japanese force on Guadalcanal, they left their radios behind. In turn, Japanese officers had to send messages by foot to submarines that alighted near the island in an uncertain schedule for relay back to Rabaul and the logistics base at Truk. 
80
This piecemeal commitment of Japanese troops, and an underestimation of the logistics necessary to sustain such a force, plagued their operations for the entire campaign.
The wrong conclusion about the amount of Americans at Guadalcanal also reinforced early Japanese convictions that the larger strategic priority was kicking the British out of New Guinea and Burma since the Americans were lessor foes. For Japanese leadership, the Americans were incapable of deploying that large a force to Guadalcanal and even if they were on the island in great numbers, they could not hold given the prowess of the IJA. 
79
80
81
Logistically, this early calculus spelled doom for later Japanese efforts. Where the Americans struggled with too much too soon, the Japanese had inadvertently set their strategy on too little too fast-a prescription for defeat in a theater in which distances from support were measured in hundreds of miles.

For the Japanese, the tactical draw at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons was a strategic loss. After a few weeks of bombing operations against
Guadalcanal and the carrier battles, the island was demanding more aircrews than Japan could produce. In an age of eotechnic power, speed, and machine warfare the Japanese still relied on a strict eotechnic process to produce their aircrews-a bespoke process with a Bushido-like curriculum-which yielded fewer than 100 pilots a year before the war. 107 Thus, the loss of the 19 aviators in just the first wave of strikes during the Battle Eastern Solomons was unsustainable for the Japanese.

The Japanese would use fast destroyers, with their smaller capacity to deliver their land forces at night, as they had done with Ichiki. The destroyers would

In turn, the Americans used Henderson field to hunt for Japanese convoys at sea while engaging Japanese attacks from the air. All the while, the carriers stood in the background, both assisting their own side while deterring the other. Control of Guadalcanal oscillated between day and night and diverged between air and sea power with the Americans embracing the former and the Japanese the latter.
After Ichiki's demise, the IJA blamed bad leadership and poor tactics, while leadership within the IJN reasoned that the Americans were a tougher foe on land than previously thought. Both services agreed, however, that Japanese needed to send another detachment to oust the Marines. On the American side, the victory over Ichiki illustrated the fierce and unrelenting nature of the Japanese soldier and brought with it a sense of foreboding about future battles. The erratic but functional supply line from Nouméa, which left the Marines with two-thirds rations and a tenuous water supply, coupled with the consistent delivery of Japanese troops over the next several weeks, did nothing to remove their dread. Regardless of nationality, soldiers suffered from malaria, fevers, disease, hunger, and dehydration in the humidity and heat of Guadalcanal. In the race to bring the most material and men to the fight, each side built on the template of logistics that they had established in the first few weeks while absorbing harsh lessons from combat on the island. The Tokyo Express delivered increasing numbers of Japanese troops onto the island. Between 29 August and 2 September 1942, more than 4,700 replacements landed.

Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi's offensive to take Henderson field on 12 September 1942 was the first demonstration of the weakness of the Japanese supply system. Kawaguchi landed with the reinforcements in early September and led his forces on another epic land-trek through the fetid and dense jungle. The Japanese suffered another stinging defeat at Edson's ridge.
The Japanese lost 633 soldiers killed, 505 wounded, and several hundred missing in the dense jungle for a casualty rate of more than 30 percent of the original force numbering approximately 5,000. 114 Their retreat foundered and

A Japanese private recorded, "They only had three days rations when they went into the attack and soon ran out. Four days they pulled their cannons over their trails but they had to give up and bury [75-mm artillery pieces]. It took around two weeks to make the trip and more than one-half of the men became sick and died on the way." 115 They had so little food for the return that some spent a week without eating anything other than jungle weeds and grass.

Despite its limitations, the Tokyo Express was all the Japanese had.

While the Americans could evacuate their sick and wounded, the lack of airpower on the island afforded the Japanese soldiers no such comfort.
Although Japanese aircraft could force Marines and US Army soldiers into bunkers and harass transport ships, they could do so for only limited time due to the great distance from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. By early September, the Marines began to harass their Japanese enemy in ways that the Tokyo Express and the Japanese air raids could not match.
The Marines adapted their P-400s-the export version of the P-39-into an effective close-air-support weapon. Not viable above 14,000 feet due to a lack of components for the oxygen system, a bi-product of the convoluted logistics system in 1942, the P-400s fared poorly against the vaunted Zeros.

With their intelligence intercepts, the Americans were able to note the building up of supplies at Rabaul and Truk. Most of the leadership believed that this presaged another attempt to expel the US from Guadalcanal. They were wrong. The situation of the Japanese troops on the island had rapidly deteriorated without food and in the face of the American offensives over December and January. Admiral Yamamoto and Japanese leadership were concerned that the cultural shame of loss was so great that the entire 29,000man garrison might commit ritual suicide by an all-out fruitless attack on the Cactus Air Force at bay. Although the Americans launched six bombers, they missed the fleeing Japanese who had alighted on rubber boats and rowed to the six escaping destroyers.

In looking back at the delivery of supplies to Guadalcanal, the ability of the Americans to deliver needed food to the island well outpaced the Japanese.
Although in the first few days, they suffered mightily for the backlog of cargo on Red Beach, the subsequent loss of cargo due to Japanese airpower strikes, and the loss at sea at the Battle of Savo Island, the Marines gained a huge advantage by capturing the Japanese food supply. Without the estimated 10 days of Japanese supply, the Americans would have had only 12 days of food remaining by the time the first supply ship arrived.
The Japanese never recovered from the initial loss of food nor did they ensure enough sustenance to win the battle on land.  231 This figure is an estimate. The exact amount of supply days for the Americans is from Vandegrift's post-action final reports. The supply days for the Japanese are-based on 5.7 tons per day per 1000 soldiers from the Japanese staff estimates of the tonnage needed to sustain the approximately 30,000 Japanese soldiers-180 tons-as quoted in Frank and Parshall in the source notes-and then cross referenced with the Tokyo Express Runs that were documented in the sources. The Americans had well over 60 days of supply by October; this is not listed to keep the figure in a scale to read the Japanese lack of supply. The transport run of 15 October 1942, with a keen use of air, sea, and land power to blunt the Cactus Air Force, allowed the Japanese to go on the offensive. It was the apogee of their food supply. The offensives to take Henderson field, however, sapped their food reserves in short order, and the Japanese were back in an emergency food situation by the first week of November. Although they attempted to innovate with barrel deliveries on destroyers, it was a technology made for battle and insufficient for logistics.
While American food supplies decreased until 20 August 1942, the first day aircraft landed at Henderson field brought a steady increase in food.
Moving that food and water forward during battles was difficult and the Americans were on two-thirds rations for six weeks; however, by September with the seaborne and airborne bombings of mid-October, the battle for supply was over. The Japanese had chosen speed over capacity, and although the Tokyo Express harassed the Americans and sent the Japanese soldiers that attacked them-all it brought was fleeting combat power. The Tokyo Express was never a transportation system with a terminus, but rather a makeshift logistics failure that ensured the death of almost two-thirds of the Japanese soldiers sent to Guadalcanal.
In a campaign to take control of an island, water transportation was the dominant mode at Guadalcanal for both sides. The capacities of the ship, transformed by diesel internal combustion engines for greater speed and size, delivered troops, supplies, and food in great quantities half a globe away from the US mainland and Japan. The moniker of dominance, however, brought a qualification for lines of supply from the sea during the Neotechnic Era. Water transportation was only feasible with control of the air.
Unlike previous eras, the ability to move men and material to battle was dependent on the control of another domain. In the Eotechnic Era, land power could affect water transportation and vice-versa at very short ranges-those of a cannonball or a musket. In the Paleotechnic era, the ranges expanded with long-range-coastal artillery pieces and large-bore ship guns. In neither epoch was the success of one line of communication determined by control of the other domain. At Guadalcanal, however, the aircraft, with its speed, range, and firepower, dictated supply from the sea.
The Americans enjoyed control of the air for the majority of the campaign and thus had a distinct advantage in supply. While the Japanese sea bombardment on Henderson field, coupled with aircraft attacks, protected the biggest cargo run by the Japanese of the entire battle on 15 October 1942. The Japanese also deftly applied airpower to remove their soldiers from the island and avoid a complete loss-their most successful logistics movement of the campaign. In addition, both sides used airpower to attack ground forces.
Japanese attacks affected American morale and sometimes slowed combat power, while US airpower limited the Japanese unloading operations and drove them into the disease-ridden jungle. This is not to say that surface fleets made no difference, but surface action could not control lines of supply as airpower did. Even in December 1942, the Japanese garnered a major surface victory at the Battle of Tassafaronga, but this victory provided no lane for logistics.
Airpower was not complete in its dominance over sea transportation.
Aircraft had primitive navigation and attitude-reference technologies. As a result, at night, low-light conditions, or in bad weather, aircraft were in peril.
While beacons and lighting set up at Henderson field aided navigation, as did radar, technologies of the electromagnetic spectrum were new and needed significant improvement to make airpower effective at night and in the weather.
This was akin to the issues surrounding the use of radar by the US Navy and the interpretation of radio reports by the Japanese during surface combat.
New technologies were not a panacea but rather a tool that took time to integrate. Even in the Neotechnic Era, both sides had their Fontenoy-an established pattern for conduction and supplying war-which demanded adaptation to the current conditions of war.
By contrast, land transportation on a remote island without an established road network and covered in thick jungle, proved no easier for the belligerents during the Neotechnic Era than it was during the Paleotechnic.
Both had their supply challenges-water for the Americans and all manner of supply for the Japanese. The lack of logistics stalled units and pushed soldiers to the limiting capacity of the human body, thereby stalling the combat power of the larger army, much as the mud in Flanders had stalled the British so completely that men wanted for water while caught in No-Man's land.
Neotechnic technology still had limits on land.
While movement overland was a struggle, delivery by air began to assume a role as a mode of transportation at Guadalcanal. The C-47 proved a valuable resource in evacuating sick and wounded American forces from the island. In addition, the navigational and operational rhythms established for medical relief helped pave the way for the critical fuel deliveries of mid-October.
Although it is hard to determine how much the transportation of fuel raised levels for the Cactus Air Force, it was enough to keep the aircraft active for a week. In turn, the small but significant amount likely contributed to the closeair-support missions flown to thwart the impending Japanese land offensive.
Although it was not as dominant as the sea or land, at Guadalcanal the air mode of transportation offered a vision of how to move goods with a speed unmatched by the former modes.
The technological limits of aircraft manifested in combat more than Williamson at Nouméa. On the beach and at the port the Americans struggled to get their logistics right-and it took months to do so.
The Japanese struggled with transition from sea to land from want rather than plenty. Getting the cargo off the beach was difficult due to the persistence of American airpower. It was their most vulnerable point of supply and US aircraft exploited this weakness. By the end of the campaign, the link between water and land had become so tenuous that the Japanese navy used barrels to make the transition. The Cactus Air Force severed this last link by strafing the supplies in the water.
In addition to the transition between sea and land modes, Neotechnic

The lessons of logistics and combat power at Guadalcanal exemplified the Japanese mismatch between strategic priorities and logistics capabilities.
The Japanese fixations on destroying the US Navy-both surface and carrier forces-did nothing to help this situation. Despite damaging or sinking all of the US carriers in the region and adding 35 allied ships to Iron-Bottom sound, control of the sea did little to help them take the island of Guadalcanal.

Hitler did not supply his army with winter gear and in fact avoided the logistics of the campaign in part due to "a superstitious avoidance of Napoleon's footsteps" and also because "he ignored practical problems," such as the fundamentals of logistics.

As for the pilots who flew over Guadalcanal, flying aircraft in the weather on the Eastern Front was risky and borderline fatal. Neither the Germans nor the Soviets had a better solution to the technological limits of flying without a visible horizon due to night or weather.
On the German side, the Junkers Ju-87 Stuka dive-bomber had no navigational instruments, and its internal radio had a transmit range of only 50 miles and a reception range of less than 120 miles.

shows how much a delivery of cargo cost, in fuel, for a theoretical delivery of 120 miles to the front. Thus, an aircraft burned 50 percent of the fuel it could deliver in transit, while a truck burned 10.5 percent of its fuel load travelling to the front. In short bursts, the speed was worth it, and with roads clogged during rainy days and the Panzers stopped without fuel, the Germans had no choice.

From June to August 1942, the fuel needs of the Luftwaffe competed with the same units its transport planes tried to supply at the front. This competition mirrored the fractious and bankrupt ideology of the leadership of the Third Reich. The Luftwaffe, long a favorite of Hitler, had its own supplyline back to the Reich, including an entire manufacturing sector wholly separate from other Wehrmacht efforts. 
113
As a result, there were competitions between the two systems subject to the political machinations of Third Reich leadership, which clamored for the favor of the Führer, which in turn created a system of supply out of touch with the realities of the front.
114
The quantity of available supply good was sufficient, but the transportation facilities suffered from the great distances and the low capacity of the three available one-track railroads running from Germany to the Taganrog (Black Sea)-Stalino-Charkow-Kursk Line. The difficulties may be understood when it is known that the following units had to be furnished supplies: A. Six (

While the Luftwaffe helped pull the Wehrmacht to Stalingrad with its mobile firepower and supply, the grassy steppes offered sustenance for the horses and camels pulling the bulk of the supplies behind them. For the human invaders, the Soviet villages became grocery stores and supply centers.
Although many of the Ukrainians were yearning to break free of the Soviet yoke, the Germans did not notice and instead focused on their own subsistence.

These tasks included air defense and observation, defining defense sectors, and planning for the defense of important targets.   In no area did the cost of summer war show more clearly than in the German air arm. The Luftwaffe lost 1,224 aircraft in only three months: June, devastated the civilian population that remained and turned the majority of the city to rubble.
Initially, the German army followed the bombing steadily into the city.
However, after the first week, the resistance of their foe stiffened. The Soviets kept reinforcing, with orders to hold the city at all cost. In turn, the city turned into battles for blocks, then for buildings, and finally rooms.

increasingly turned to the Luftwaffe to pound the city into submission-and it did. While the initial bombing had expended 1,000 tons of bombs over the entire city, later attacks focused hundreds of tons of bombs on individual targets. For example, in October the Luftwaffe dropped 600 tons of bombs on just the tractor factory to prepare the way for a ground assault.

Richtofen, these close-in strikes were "less than a hand-grenade's throw from the German infantry" and wasted the firepower and flexibility of aircraft on fights better suited to land weapons. 
145
To counter this threat from the air, the Soviets turned to the night, much as the Japanese did at Guadalcanal, to supply themselves. Whereas the Japanese had hundreds of miles of ocean to cross in the night, the Soviets had a shorter commute to the front lines. The concealed movement to and across the Volga fed into the hard lessons learned of more than 14 months of war against airpower-maskirovka was all-important. Chuikov recorded the difficult logistics operations:
Small units ferried across during the night to the right back had to be deployed and established in positions straight away, during the night, and supplies had to be distributed to the troops, otherwise they would have been bombed and destroyed. We had neither horses nor trucks . . . everything that was brought across the Volga, therefore, had to be distributed to the troops' positions on the shoulders of our men: during the day they fought off fierce enemy assaults, and at night, without sleep and rest, they had to carry ammunition, provisions and engineering equipment. The result was exhaustion, and of course, lower fighting efficiency. 150 If the Imperial Japanese Army misunderstood the balance of supply at Guadalcanal-preferring firepower and men to food for the first few monthsthe Soviets understood the logistics calculations all too well. Backing the limited prospect of food or survival was Stalin's "Not One Step Back!" order and the secret police Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del (NKVD)-always on the lookout for deserters or those soldiers insufficiently galvanized to the cause.

As the weather turned colder, the Sixth Army slowly ground its way into Stalingrad and began to suffer from declining combat power as well. Although food was in much better supply than for their enemy, ammunition, fuel, and the supply of soldiers were limited.

With their manpower dwindling and their supplies stretched to the limit of what their land transportation could bear, the Germans attempted to save resources. With space on the trains at a premium, the German general staff decided to move "some 150,000 horses, as well as a number of oxen and even camels," away from the front-line support in the city back to the rail lines.

Thus, the chance for the Sixth Army to take the city was in November while the moving ice was a threat to Soviet water transportation and the river turned into a road. Richtofen lamented, "If we can't clear this situation up now . . . when the Volga is blocked with ice floes and the Russians are in real difficulties, we shall never be able to. As it is, the days are getting shorter and weather worse." 195 While German commanders worried about the tactical supply of the city, the Soviets continued to prepare their logistics for counterattack.

As the lift began on 24 November 1942, the continual threat from Soviet anti-aircraft-artillery, aircraft of the VVS, and the weather took their toll. The He-111s were better suited to cold weather and needed fewer fighters to help them into the Kessel. The Ju-52s, by contrast, were built for transportation.

A more probing analysis examines whether or not the Sixth Army could have fed itself even if the airlift had met the cargo delivery amounts. Although tonnages, it is safe to say that the 20 days of supplies for 11,000 would have equaled 1 day of supply for 250,000 German and Axis-allied soldiers trapped in the Kessel. In other words, the Sixth Army required a system of thousands of support troops to help manage and control the cargo process-an impossible labor requirement given the need to fight back against the Soviet encirclement.
Added to the physical handling of the cargo, the aircraft also required runways clear or packed evenly. More sorties would not have improved the Sixth Army's ability to keep the runways safe.
From a technological perspective, there were strong radio beacons in the pocket for navigation, which helped planes arrive at the airfield even in bad weather.

Blitzkrieg demanded a more flexible and mobile logistics than any centralized system could handle; therefore logistics was split among forces rather than States and the Soviet Union the ability to expand the usable portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio and infrared to the visible waves of television, to monitor each other. In warfare, these technological improvements made it easier to guide missiles and weapons towards aircraft, while also making it tougher for machines run by internal combustion engines to hidetheir heat and noise giving off returns for computers to process and locate.
The computer also helped promulgate mass media by underpinning the space race, itself a battle for nuclear supremacy, and the launching of satellites. In this post-war world, international affairs did not wait for the newspaper, the telegraph, or the radio, but were broadcast for visual production of materials that the world needs. Then you have the possibility that many human beings pass under a dictatorship that is inimical to the free world. Finally, you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the 'falling domino' principle. You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly . . .

The deployments for battle, which had taken five years at Lake George, a year on the Western Front in 1917, and several months for the push Stalingrad and Guadalcanal, were scheduled for weeks under Flexible Response.

According to the USMC account of the battle:
The NVA gunners fired only a few rounds every hour so that continuous muzzle flashes did not betray their positions and, after each round, quickly scurried out to cover the guns with protective nets and screens. Some pieces mounted on tracks, were wheeled out of caves in Co Roc Mountain [in Laos], fired, and returned immediately. Though never used in as great a quantity as the rocks and mortars, these shells wreaked havoc at Khe Sanh because there was very little that they could not penetrate; even duds went about four feet into the ground. 
130
In addition, the information kill-chain grew shorter as the Marines and pilots learned how to employ the system. 
138
At Khe Sanh, the enemy could not move up against the wire because of the small arms fire and mortar coverage. He would move his logistics bases within 3 km [3000 meters] of the lines because he felt we would not bomb that close to our lines with B-52. . . . For his attack, he would build trenches radially toward the base, and when as close as he felt safe in coming, he would dig trenches parallel to our lines. The troops would go through the trenches and attack on a line front. Sensors located on the trails to the bunker and trench complex would tell when his reserve forces were being moved into position for an attack . . . Air and artillery would strike the reserve forces coming to join the attack . . . Five times he tried this kind of attack, and five times he suffered tremendous casualties. A number of times, the sensors gave all the indications of an impending attack and the artillery and air barrage was started but the attack never came. 139
The most striking example of the success of the system was the detection of NVA troops against Hill 881S (See Figure

As the siege wore on, the Americans shortened the time from notification by the Muscle Shoals system to striking a target from 30 minutes to 16 minutes by 
March 1968. 146
Even the one success the NVA had at overrunning a Marine position, the assault on Lang Vei on the night of 6 February 1968, was a pyrrhic victory. As predicted by the Marines the previous year, the NVA isolated the camp with ease. Using three infantry battalions and nine PT-76 tanks they had moved down the Ho Chi Minh trail, the NVA overwhelmed the 850 defenders-Laotian soldiers, local Bru tribesmen, and 24 American Special Forces soldiers. 
147
157
With the transportation of supplies by the Americans increasing in early 162 Due to the risk of LAPES, the Marines also developed the Ground Proximity Extraction System (GPES). The GPES was a hook system, similar to the trap on an aircraft carrier. The pilot would land on the ground and catch a cable with a hook connected to the cargo pallet.
The cable would pull the cargo out of the plane and the aircraft would continue down the runway for a takeoff.
Shawn Callahan, the fire support command center "gave antiaircraft positions a very high priority in targeting, and once a 37 mm position was identified, it was repeatedly attacked until it was destroyed or abandoned. By the end of the siege, the Marines claimed more than 300 had been destroyed.  By late February, the situation, even for the outposts was much better.

For the sick and wounded of the NVA, the situation was even more For crappers and piss tubes, we buried the artillery powder canisters in which our water arrived-just deep enough to hold them. . . . an 82 mm mortar round found its way into the stack and it rained a most foul and disagreeable barrage down upon us. It was decided that the system must change. . . . Someone got the bright idea to just roll them over the edge of the hill. He explained, after nearly everyone stated that it was a bad idea because Charlie would get them, that it was okay for Charlie to have them. 'Picture it,' he told us, 'Here comes Charlie, crawling several hundred meters from his protective cave to the bottom of our hill. He's braved mortars, artillery, and the most fearsome bombing in the history of warfare to get close to us, probe us, and pick up anything that he could find along the way. . . .these poor bastards find a gold mine. These tubes represent so many possibilities; live artillery shells, perhaps food, maybe they know about how our water's delivered [emphasis added], or maybe the tubes can be filled with earth and used to reinforce their bunkers. The Charlies risk life and limb to drag as many canisters back to their cave as possible . . . After having the canisters dragged to his own tiny room in the back of the cave, the first sergeant opens one.'
185
By the end of March, soldiers of the NVA "lived on a half a pound of rice a day" and soldiers captured by the Marines during the final days of the siege in April reported, "no food at all for three days." 
186
For the Americans, the sensors covered the rest of the battlefield. As the Muscle Shoals map shows, even movements crossing the DMZ to the north or coming across roads from Laos to the west were well covered. Thus, the Americans would have detected the feeding of more than 28,000 soldiers in any coordinated effort of trucks or people. While it is tough to gauge how hungry the NVA were in detail, like the combatants at Guadalcanal and Stalingrad, their supply situation was dire. I was standing radio watch in the command bunker, and I listened to Captain Dabney and other officers discussing plans to leave the hill because without water and food fighting ability can be compromised. Some had the idea of leaving and fighting our way back . . . Captain Dabney's idea was to fool the NVA and set out for Laos. Once over the border, an LZ could be set up and evacuation by helicopter could begin. Luckily, for all of us, the next day we received a major re-supply of food and water, and the battle continued as it had been. 
195
The situation on Hill 950 was just as bad, and the Marines at the main base devised a method to deliver water via old 155 mm shell casings and "filling them with plastic bladders that were used in milk dispensers . . . and dropping them on the hills."
196
197
The The second advantage to air transportation in the Holotechnic era was the ability to perform a full range of operations. These operations were not expedients as at Guadalcanal or Stalingrad, but rather normal mission-sets.
From standard cargo missions to helicopter supply, airdrop, and aeromedical evacuation, air transportation provided a decided advantage for the Americans over the North Vietnamese.
Critical to this flexibility was the C-130 cargo aircraft. Coupled with computing technology and radars, the Americans used the C-130 to perfect an airdrop system in the weather, a procedure never tried but proven reliable enough within a few days to deliver cargo in the sufficient amounts. In addition to airdrop, these aircraft had the capacity for standard cargo missions or LAPES cargo-releases for delivery to the Khe Sanh base as well. Much like Braddock's Conestoga wagons, the "Hercs" were the ideal technology for the job.
Added to the fixed-wing mission, the US used helicopters to supply their outposts on the hills surrounding Khe Sanh to maintain the high ground while Despite its effectiveness at Khe Sanh and its potential to be an equivalent mode of transportation-moving goods by air and stopping those of the enemy was expensive. For example, the fuel for only the C-130 missions eclipsed $5 million dollars-and they burned fuel at a miserly three miles per gallon. 
226
While the NVA thwarted airpower by moving during bad weather and at For the hill outposts, the slowing of helicopters for offload of cargo and on-load made them the most vulnerable and thus the NVA destroyed 33 helicopters. 
228
For the American military, Vietnam was a watershed. An example of      supply system at the docks, and eventually a robust overland supply network with depots, to ensure the cargo survived the threat from Native American raids. Sir Eric Geddes's system with more cranes at the ports, more rail lines, and better information flow, allowed the British to pursue their offensives of 1917. At Nouméa, Admiral Halsey simplified the system, rather than making it more robust, separating the Army and Navy cargo to speed up the deliveries to Guadalcanal. Thus, the solution for rear-echelon logistics was a network of disparate elements-information, technology, and dedicated logistics planning to solve the problem.
The technologies of the age also imposed a time-requirement to establish a successful network. In other words, the faster the technology moved logistics to the front, the more quickly the supply network needed to be established.
For example, the British took years to build their network from Albany to Lake George, which was sufficient in the era of wood, wind, and sail for the  The challenge of transitioning modes and establishing the proper supply network to support that transition, illustrates how important joint operations were to logistics. Most notable in their lack of integration among the various services were the Germans at Stalingrad and the Japanese at Guadalcanal.
For the Germans, the petty and sycophantic competition to curry favor with Hitler between the Luftwaffe and the Ostheer led to supply shortages at the front. For the Japanese, the inability of the army to understand how capable their enemy was and how hard it was to supply the island coupled with the Imperial Japanese Navy's reluctance to interfere, led to the starvation of 28,000 troops. Thus, the joint force remains an enabler of the logistics in the same way that logistics enables the joint forces. This synergy appears continuous over the past three hundred years.
Despite the need for supply networks to match technological advances, the most striking continuity over the last three centuries was more simple: the impact of sustenance-food and water-on the outcome of battle. While this factor seems obvious in the eighteenth century, with wooden wagons, ships, and limited methods to preserve food in the field, food and water supplies for the belligerents at Khe Sanh were just as important as those at Lake George had been. Even with the modern firepower, computing power, and transportation possessed by the United States and the NVA, the key to US success was access to water, and for the North Vietnamese food.
Even on the Western Front in 1917, lack of food and water was at least partially responsible for the stalled British offensives at Ypres; and, more important, food supply at home shaped the operational planning for both sides.
The British tried to strike at Ypres and towards Flanders, in part due to the threat the submarine posed to the food supplies of the British population. For the Germans, the pullback to the Hindenburg line, the unleashing of the Uboats on shipping in the Atlantic, and their decision to stay on the defensive until the Russians capitulated in the East, was motivated by the lack of food for the civilian population.
Beyond the linking of food to tactical, operational, and strategic considerations for war, there is also a temporal constant associated with food supplies-15 days. Whether Dieskau's troops who limped back to Fort Carillon starving, the Japanese at Guadalcanal, or the Germans in the Kessel, a 15-day food deficit represented the limit to effective operations. Any food deficit beyond a fortnight doomed the combatants. How quickly an army starve! Even Carl Von Clausewitz, who understood the relationship between food and victory, believed food took second place to combat power when war reached its apex of intensity. Clausewitz theorized that supply was more important "on the other hand, where a state of equilibrium has set in, in which troops move back and forth for years in the same province, subsistence is likely to become the principal concern." 1 For Clausewitz the transition between the now and later of food importance seemed take on a timeline of months-when, as this study has shown, it is days. Thus, the limit of the human body, much more than technological advance, determined the outcome of battle.
Given the limits of the human body, the feat of General Edward
Braddock in getting his army to Fort Duquesne represented a logistic feat for the ages. To put Braddock's logistical prowess in historical context, the archetype general of the Eotechnic Era-Frederick the Great-"could march for a maximum of ten days before a pause became necessary."

Technological changes, by their impact on logistics, alter geopolitical balances. The railroad allowed land transportation to compete with water transportation, and coupled with the Neotechnic technology of the submarine, allowed a land power in Germany to threaten to overturn centuries of British world dominance. The airplane, in turn, demanded control of the air to deliver logistics to the battlefield. The manufacturing base, expense, and human capital needed to produce such an air force, meant that only nations with vast air forces could compete on the stage as great powers, much as the requirement for a great navy determined world stature centuries before.
The advancement of nuclear weapons and telecommunications in the Holotechnic Era elevated the narrative of war over airpower. Despite profligate supply, and winning every battle, the United States lost the war. Thus, the Holotechnic Era represents a clean break from the previous three centuries.
of the Monongahela. The British also had 100 rounds per man extra musket shot in addition to the 24 rounds each man carried on with him.

Since the eighteenth century, and battles like Fontenoy, the ability of one side or the other to marshal its forces to battle and sustain them had underpinned victory. The "fustest with mostest" had held for three centuries.
Although there were many exceptions at the tactical level, at the strategic level the nations that best moved and supplied their forces won-the British at Lake George, the allies on the Western Front in 1918 after the logistics of the Americans tilted the tie between sea and land power, the Soviets at Stalingrad, and the Americans at Guadalcanal. At Khe Sanh, the formula changed.
Despite their ability to supply the Marines at will, a luxury all armies of the past three centuries would have envied, and the subsequent maiming of the NVA, the Americans and their South Vietnamese ally lost the war.

Using the cyber means for delivery dispenses with the need for a vast transportation network of ships, trains, or planes, to move goods to war. In turn, the ability to manufacture weapons of war so quickly and move them at A counter argument to the increased capability of the cyber mode of transportation is the continued need for resources. While a 3D printer can manufacture items at great speed and distance, the technology still needs a source of slurry from which to build weapons or supplies. Thus, those nations that have greater resources, the great-power nations of today-the United States, Russia, China, and the nations of Western Europe-will still have much to say about the use of those resources for war. In either case, as the technological landscape changes, the US should take heed not just of the benefits-more stuff faster to war-but also the impacts to global order.
With the increased speed in moving goods over cyberspace and placing them in combat, a network of logistics that can keep pace is critical to overcome the challenges of the changing modes of transportation. In the past, it was from sea to land or air to land (or vice versa). In the future, it may be cyber to land (or sea or air). If the Germans needed a workable network in a couple of days to survive in the Kessel, how much quicker would a network need to be if 10,000 automatic rifles, of 5000 micro drones were printed for immediate use on the battlefield? Without the capability to handle a surge of logistics, too much could be as bad as too little-especially at the key transition points where supply goes from one mode to another.
Nonetheless, despite the possible benefits and pitfalls of future on the battlefield, "robotic mules," unmanned aerial vehicles, robotic soldiers, and 3D printers; the individual human still has an organic limit to life, which technology has not solved.

The general was accustomed to European practices of private sutlers and commissaries followed the Army to sell food, alcohol, and sometimes women for use by the Army. This type of arrangement allowed the Army to pass the cost of moving food onto a private enterprise. There was no such system set up to support Braddock in colonial America.

Budge estimates the range of fuel consumption for a ship at .7 to .9 pounds per hour, per Shaft Horse Power (SHP). The larger Japanese cargo ships-Type A and C burned a range of 1.5 to 3.0 tons per hour at this rate (2000 to 2500 SHP). While this was respectable, the Japanese also had older ships which about 10 knots and burned coal-combining a slow speed with the a power source that needed labor intensive extraction when compared to oil. Transport ships for troops could move faster (17 knots) at the higher burn rate of oil at 5.8 to 8.5 tons of oil per hour (16,600 SHP), but could carry ten times the cargo.

The exact number available for either front varied depending on the missions needed. Excepting the initial bombardment of Stalingrad on 23 August 1942 and the Tractor factory operation in October-when Stalingrad took priority for all airplane-the aircraft used over Stalingrad would have been a percentage of this number.

With the math of logistics against them, the Japanese began to embrace a supply system based on calculated fatalism. The Imperial Japanese staff recorded, "Plans were drafted for suicide shipments [Teishin Yuso or 'ant landings'] to Guadalcanal with 16 large landing barges, supported by six destroyers and two submarines."

For the Japanese, the oil the Tokyo Express had consumed, coupled with the air and sea losses and the shocking defeat of Major General Kawaguchi in   his attempt to take Henderson field, resulted in a strategic refocus. The Japanese army and navy stopped all offensive action in other theaters including those against Port Moresby and Burma in order to support Japanese lost 21 Aircraft between 21 Aug -11 Sep and 35 thereafter-in addition to 16 on the first two days of the marine landing. The Cactus Air Force lost 65 between 20 August (first day of operation) and 21 September 1942. They lost five more the in proceeding days. These losses do not count the carrier battle at the Eastern Solomons.

While the control of the air around Henderson Field gave the US a distinct advantage, the Neotechnic technologies of the time could not overcome the environmental factors of bad weather and darkness. US fighter and smaller dive-bomber aircraft possessed only rudimentary turn-and-slip indicators and no navigation, thus flight through thick cloudbanks or even short distances away from island landmarks courted disaster.

The Japanese staff lamented, "The weather changes completely enroute [from Rabaul], and pilots encounter unexpected weather over Guadalcanal, which hampers their operations."

The Marines had a strong defensive position on land and more men than ever.
Although Wasp and Saratoga were gone, the Enterprise, back from repairs, and the Hornet still stood out to the east to block any Japanese carrier movement.
Although the American leadership had intelligence suggesting a renewed Japanese offensive, the victory at Edson's ridge infused hope that was reflected in more positive reports from the normally negative Admiral Ghormley.

To screen the slower transports and the follow-on heavy cruisers that were to shell Henderson Field, the Japanese sent a surface fleet to Savo Island on 11 October 1942. In another night engagement, the United States Navy fought to a win at the Battle of Cape Esperance with four American cruisers and six destroyers facing three Japanese cruisers, eight destroyers, and two seaplane carriers in reserve.

Instead, the Japanese seemed to embrace the counterfactual as a strategy and a logistics support plan: "What if?" . . . they had a few more soldiers, a few more artillery pieces, or a little more food? . . . Then victory was certain. Only after two months of fighting and a significant drain on their resources, did the Japanese finally readjust their operational priorities and shift forces from other regions, including China, to Guadalcanal. Paradoxically, the Japanese did so only when they were certain that the Soviets were tied up at Stalingrad, in essence rooting for a bogged down offensive for their German ally. By the time Japan refocused its priorities, however, the United States had begun to solve its own logistics problems and in turn cement marine positions on the island. This inability to change their strategic focus from China and the Soviets along with the failure to create a sufficient supply network to hold their gains hurt the Japanese greatly. Even after the loss at Guadalcanal, the insistence on another offensive towards Port Moresby and the Australians, illustrated the Japanese lack of understanding of their own logistics' shortcomings and the strength of their adversary's.
The Neotechnic pull for resources drove the Third Reich, like its Japanese ally, to expand the German Empire. The most important of these acquisitions were to be land and oil. On the one side of the equation was During the inter-war years, the association of the German nation with the older Paleotechnic technology of the railroad had gravitated to the faster and more mobile technologies of the airplane and the car. The airplane was the ultimate technology of the Neotechnic era, with its construction of light alloys and a small-but powerful engine, and the Third Reich used the Luftwaffe to great effect in the Spanish Civil War and during planned state visits. James Corum, in The Luftwaffe, notes that through these demonstrations, "The world received the impression that the Germans had creased a fearsome air force that Nowhere was that optimism higher than with the Führer. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich's propaganda minister, recorded, "For the coming spring and summer the Führer has a clear plan. He does not want a boundless war.
Its objectives are the Caucuses, Leningrad and Moscow."

The German invasion of the Heartland in the summer of 1941 devastated the Soviet Union. In addition to the aforementioned six million casualties, the Soviets ceded a "territory equivalent in U.S. terms to the entire region from the Atlantic coast to Springfield, Illinois." 47 Added to this, the key agricultural region of the Ukraine was now in the hands of the Germans. Food production plummeted from of 95.6 million tons of grain in 1940 to 26.7 million tons in

From the perspective of logistics, the first lesson was the threat airpower posed to Soviet lines of communication. At Kharkov, German airpower protected its own supply line while also inhibiting the flow of Soviet material and men to the front. In their review of the battle, Soviet officers recorded, "Having gained air superiority over the battlefield, the enemy was able to protect its operations with strong tactical aviation support, concentrating its bombers on . . . second echelons, and on roads and river crossing within the area of combat operations."

The Soviets also understood and articulated the danger that aircraft posed to their rear-area support and logistics. In a treatise on the operation of rear-area forces, the Stavka stated, "The primary means of enemy pressures on the rear is aviation used for the purpose of demolishing administration increasing with the Führer's rising frustration.

Chuikov and the 62nd Army poured men into the shrinking pocket of Stalingrad in November but the situation became more precarious as the ice began to flow down the Volga, further threatening to movements across the river. Moving soldiers and equipment into the city had been an exceedingly difficult operation. The German air arm, army gunners, and artillery had punished the Volga crossings throughout the fall. In addition, the Luftwaffe continually severed Chuikov's telephone links to his units fighting in the city and destroyed Chuikov's own command post numerous times.

Chuikov reported, "The fuel tanks were on fire. A fountain of smoke eight hundred meters high . . . They dragged me out of the river of fire . . . Up to forty men were killed at the headquarters."

As a result, the logistics that followed was ammunition and fuel for machinery, and for this, men suffered.   would usher in an era in which the organic overcame the machine.

Thrust into a cauldron of firepower, the two divisions of North
Vietnamese and the two battalions of United States Marines held on in miserable conditions. While the logistics of the United States were far superior, the men of both sides suffered. For the average NVA soldier, Khe Sanh was a nightmare.
The food situation for the US Marines was not ideal, but it was sufficient.
Food consisted mostly of unappealing C-rations (pre-cooked and canned meals) but it met their subsistence needs. Sometimes the hill outposts had to ration food-cutting C-rations to one meal a day. At the height of the supply crisis in early February, First Lieutenant Crenshaw wrote in a letter home, "The food situation here is critical. The only food we have is C-rations. We have had to restrict our Marines to one meal per day to ensure we have enough food if this
The planning staffs at III MAF and MACV recognized the difficulty of supplying Khe Sanh by air and wanted to guarantee access to the base over land by the time the monsoon rains came in early summer. They set the start date for Operation Pegasus in early April before the monsoon season began.

The railheads were ten to fifteen miles back. The roads were blocked and the gun ammunition and guns were piling up in England . . . They had no programmes, they had no statistics, they were short of material, short of foresight.
-Sir Eric Geddes, Director General Military Rail in France, Winter 1916-17   If war is to be waged in accordance with its essential spirit, with the unbridled violence that lies at its core, the craving and the need for battle and decisionthen feeding the troops, though important is a secondary matter. On the other hand, where a state of equilibrium has set in, in which troops move back and forth for years in the same province, subsistence is likely to become the principal concern. In that case, the quarter-master-general becomes the supreme commander, and the conduct of war consists of organizing the wagon trains.

The second priority was to be food, and the third priority warm clothing. We were deliberately going on hunger strike . . . we could not do without men and ammunition. Shortage of ammunition in this situation meant certain death. While helicopter resupply missions to the hill outposts and cargo deliveries to the Khe Sanh runway were challenging, the Americans illustrated how to overcome the difficulty of transitioning between modes of transportation. For the helicopter deliveries, the Americans used the "Super Gaggle"-airpower as logistics support. For fixed-wing deliveries, the Marines adapted radar designed for aircraft approaches to guide USAF C-130s to
The representative technologies of transportation of war are only a fraction of the various machines used throughout each era. For the technologies of war, the ranges are estimates for comparison and varied greatly between nation and conflict. For transportation, the term ton-mile per day is measure of capacity and speed and used in modern logistics to compare capability across air, land, and water modes of transportation. Ton-mile is a theoretical value based on 24-hours of operation at a given speed and cargo load.

Often times the ship will be full of volume (i.e. no space left), before the limit of its deadweight tonnage (maximum weight the ship can handle and still maneuver safely/stay afloat).
