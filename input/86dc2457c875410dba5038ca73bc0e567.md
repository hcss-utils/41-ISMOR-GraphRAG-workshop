The emergence of hybrid warfare in the 21 st century has its roots in the political warfare used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Given the economic and military weaknesses Russia suffers from in comparison with the US, this type of strategy gives Moscow a tool to achieve its objectives without expending a great amount of blood and treasure.
PMSCs play a significant role in Russia's use of hybrid warfare, extending its influence through patriotic youth camps and sometimes representing Russian interests abroad.
The most recent example of this strategy occurred in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, where Russian support to secessionist groups continues to undermine a peaceful resolution.
