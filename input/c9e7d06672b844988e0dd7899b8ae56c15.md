A frequently expressed concern is that Russia will feed world instability by exporting either weapons of mass destruction or the knowledge how to make them.
Stephen Meyer examined this and related problems in a symposium he organized on the status of Russian Military R&D that was held at the program in November 1992.
The general conclusion of the participants was that Russian military R&D capabilities are rapidly deteriorating and that Russia's export temptations are constrained by its own proximity to conflicts and the need to maintain cooperative ties with the United States.
