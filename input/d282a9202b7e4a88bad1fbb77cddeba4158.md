This observation influenced Frunze later in the UMD debate, as he attempted to grapple with the technological backwardness of the Red Army.
But there were three major themes that Engels continued to address throughout his writings that influenced Frunze the most.
These themes are the nature of the proletarian way of war, the type of army that is appropriate for a Socialist State, and the total integration and subordination of all aspects of power to the State.
These themes surely rang true with Frunze because they reinforced his experiences in the Russian Civil War, as well as his earlier political experiences in Ivanovo-Voznesensk and in the 1905 Revolution.
