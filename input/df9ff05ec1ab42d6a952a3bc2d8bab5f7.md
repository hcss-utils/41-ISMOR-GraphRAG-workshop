After the Cold War, the West continued to operate in the Black Sea, but those operations did not result in any newsworthy confrontations until Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Since 2014, Russia has aggressively confronted Western warships operating in international waters in the Black Sea.
In late 2020, HMS Dragon conducted the first newsworthy innocent passage of a Western warship within 12 nautical miles of Crimea since the Cold War with little controversy.
Conversely, the subsequent 2021 innocent passage by HMS Defender drew a much more aggressive Russian response.
This thesis provides a historical context for these innocent passages and explores the U.S. and UK rationale for their conduct, as well as Russia's objections.
