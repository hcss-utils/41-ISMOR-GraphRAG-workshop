Russia's C4ISR represents a combination of legacy Soviet systems and the emulation and adaptation of concepts and approaches, such as net-centric warfare.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was left with hundreds of stove-piped command and control (C2) systems and did not invest significantly in modernization of these systems through the 1990s and early 2000s.
During this period Russia studied Western C4ISR and hoped eventually to adapt modern C4ISR developments as well.
With the increase in defense resources after 2008, Russia began modernizing its C4ISR infrastructure in earnest.
Through the creation of the National Defense Management Center (NDMC) and continued integration with civilian agencies, local and regional governments, military, and internal security services, Russia has laid the foundations for a C4ISR infrastructure more complicated and interconnected than the U.S. interagency, with both the potential risks and benefits of greater centralization.
Russia is in the process of developing and implementing a modern, whole-of-government C4ISR infrastructure that will enable Russia to pursue its vision of net-centric or "noncontact warfare."
For example, in 2014 Russia established the NDMC, pursuing the integration of existing communications systems within a single network, as well as the development of UAVs, space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and other sensors.
Still, Russia's ability to develop and integrate high-technology C4ISR will continue to be limited by Russia's poorly developed domestic electronics industry, Western sanctions, and high costs (see Appendix I for details).
