This thesis explores the viability of utilizing unconventional warfare (UW) as a strategic approach to safeguard Estonia's sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the threat emanating from the Russian Federation.
Given Estonia's close proximity to Russia and the latter's assertive foreign policy, this study presents an empirical examination that specifically delves into the geographical aspects of northeastern Europe and their impact on the implementation of unconventional warfare within Estonia's Comprehensive Defense strategy.
The primary objectives of this research are twofold: first, to address the existing gaps in knowledge concerning the strategic principles applicable to small nations employing unconventional warfare for defensive purposes; and second, to identify and elucidate the variables that exert influence on the utilization of unconventional warfare in Estonia, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive defensive strategy.
