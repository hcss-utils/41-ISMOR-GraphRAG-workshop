Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to the destruction of infrastructure, disruption of public services, and damage to the social fabric in ways that have some similarities to destruction caused by natural hazards, such as fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes.
Similar to the damage inflicted by natural disasters, the damage in Ukraine has been done to a society by an external force: Russia's invasion and way of war in Ukraine have caused massive loss of life, damage to civilian infrastructure-in the areas of housing, transport, commerce, industry, and more-and widespread displacement of people from their homes.
