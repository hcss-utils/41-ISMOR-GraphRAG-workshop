In Ukraine, Russia already maintained a large military presence at the Black Sea Fleet's base in Sevastopol, Crimea.
Years before the onset of wider military operations, Russia again offered passports to ethnic Russian citizens of Ukraine.
Instead of initially trying to create an ethnic conflict however, Russia used the large population of Russians in Ukraine to attempt to take control of the Ukrainian government through political proxies.
In 2004, Russian political operatives funneled over $300 million dollars to a pro-Russian presidential candidate and Russian security services helped orchestrate massive electoral fraud to manipulate the outcome of the election.
When the vote was overturned and the new Ukrainian administration began building closer ties to the EU, Putin used demonstrates anything, it is that Russia is willing to pursue multiple hybrid campaigns against both near and far targets simultaneously.
Game theoretic analysis of possible Russian strategies may indicate Russia's calculations regarding the conditions for hybrid warfare outside of the purely post-Soviet space.
This approach may help illuminate Russia's strategic objectives, as well as identify specific vulnerabilities in the international system.
