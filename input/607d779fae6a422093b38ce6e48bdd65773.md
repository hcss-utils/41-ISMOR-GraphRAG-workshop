Fourth, while overall proficiency may have improved, multiple factors-including Russia's 2022 military performance in Ukraine-suggest that there is, and will be, significant variance in individual proficiency across the Armed Forces.
Over the past 15 years, poor personnel management has resulted in both a large overabundance and deficits of personnel at different times.
In the former case, a shortage of assigned officer positions for lieutenants limited their opportunities to develop, and in the latter case, the MoD had to reduce training requirements (e.g., programs at military academies went from five to four years in length) to get the officers to their operational units quicker.
While staffing might be more stable today, the effects of earlier incoherence might still be present.
The MoD has also had to balance limited funding and has, for example, prioritized equipping and training the VKS in recent years, thus increasing the VKS's proficiency while sacrificing other specialties.
