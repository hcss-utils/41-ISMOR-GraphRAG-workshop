A counterargument to the above is that low-level/proxy/ or peripheral theaters are familiar to strategic competition.
They occurred within strategic competitions long before nuclear weapons or the security/insecurity paradox.
Athenian and Spartan support for myriad smaller city-states, French support for American colonists, British support to Portuguese and Spanish guerrillas, French support to dissidents in Ireland, British subversion of the continental system, Imperial German proffers to Mexico, Western Support for White Russians, and Soviet and Fascist support to opposing sides of the Spanish Civil War all occurred before nuclear weapons.
One can therefore argue that this facet of strategic competition is marked by continuity through the atomic age rather than change because of it.
However, while low-level conflict below the threshold of state-on-state war has long been part of strategic competition, the stability/instability paradox means that states which might otherwise be deterred from this low-level action by the conventional response (e.g., Pakistan with India) are emboldened by their nuclear umbrella.
Dr. Fair's analysis of the increase in lowlevel Pakistan attacks following their atomic tests is persuasive.
