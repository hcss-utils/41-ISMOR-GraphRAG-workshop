The first and last elements of Russia's security strategy, strategic deterrence, and internal security, are inherently defensive, although strategic deterrent forces could threaten the United States and its allies.
Russia clearly sees threats from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) enlargement and the enhancement of U.S./NATO military capabilities on its borders, and the possibility exists that Russia's view of the threat could increase or a crisis could develop that could lead to unintended military escalation.
U.S. policymakers need to be attuned to Russian perceptions of the threat posed by U.S. force deployments in Europe.
