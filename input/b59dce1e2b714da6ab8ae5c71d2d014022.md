# Fulltext:
The Kremlin has a long history of executing well-coordinated influence operations against its perceived adversaries in order to subvert and undermine them indirectly.
With the advent of the information age, Moscow has realized new cyber domain opportunities and started to exploit this domain as a force multiplier for their political-military campaigns, thus, making specific operations more feasible and cost-effective as well.
In other words, it has provided additional means for Russia to bolster its influence campaigns by employing a combination of cyber intrusions and propaganda.
In retrospect, Russia's activities primarily against its neighbors-Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine-demonstrated that it perceives cyberspace as an effective domain for employing their tactics successfully.
