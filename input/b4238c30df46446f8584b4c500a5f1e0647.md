In keeping with the grand strategic objective in the Pacific Theater to force unconditional surrender of the Japanese, the Allies strategy pursued several strategic tracks.
First, the effort would depend heavily upon U.S. allies in theater to defend against and place maximum pressure upon the Japanese.
This included resistance from the British in the Burma/India/Indian Ocean area as well as Chinese forces in Burma and in China itself.
Later in the war, the U.S. encouraged Russia to attack Japan from the north.
