As part of its more assertive foreign policy during the decade prior to its 2022 war in Ukraine, Moscow had developed and used a proxy war capability that was able to sustain conflicts within the former Soviet Union on a substantial scale as well as project power well outside the borders of the former USSR.
The Donbas conflict beginning in 2014 continued on a larger scale and for a much longer period than those conflicts in Transnistria and South Ossetia in the early 1990s.
In addition to its support to Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Russian forces have begun to make their appearance in countries such as Libya.
This power-projection capability had probably atrophied prior to the recapitalization of the Russian military in the early 2010s.
Compared with its indifferent (if successful) performance in Georgia in 2008, the campaign in Syria proved that Russia can conduct a successful military intervention far from its borders.
91 The long-term effects of the 2022 Ukraine conflict on this capability, however, remain to be seen.
