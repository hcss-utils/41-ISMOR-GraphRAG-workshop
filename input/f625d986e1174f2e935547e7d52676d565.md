The Kremlin's overarching foreign policy goals are to become a regional hegemon and global great power.
It relies on its nuclear deterrent to underwrite its revisionist goals.
The Kremlin is pursuing these goals through: building alliances to balance against the United States, trade and proliferation of military technology throughout Eurasia, engagement in the periphery of the Middle East and Global South, and supporting the political will of Russia's diaspora in the post-Soviet space.
