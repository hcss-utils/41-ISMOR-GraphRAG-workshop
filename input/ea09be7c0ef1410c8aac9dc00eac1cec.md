Use of the term hybrid threat to describe potential future adversaries has become increasingly more common in the lexicon of the US military over the last decade. The term is codified in army doctrine, and training strategies are employed to combat hybrid threats. Military historian and retired US Marine Corps officer Dr. Frank Hoffman notes that the effort to define and describe hybrid threat began in the US nearly fifteen years ago at the Marine Corps' Warfighting Lab, 1 but the term emerged more commonly in US military dialogue after the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.
The concept of hybrid threat is complex and allows actors in a conflict to employ a wide array of means beyond just conventional military forces. It includes not only the combination of conventional forces and unconventional, or irregular, forces and tactics, but leverages other nonmilitary factors to achieve strategic ends. Those additional non-military factors include, but are not limited to, politics, economics, culture, values, identity, and history. The definition of hybrid warfare that appears in the 2015 National Military strategy notes "there exists an area of conflict where actors blend techniques, capabilities, and resources to achieve their objectives."

Major William Nemeth was one of the first in the US military to use the term hybrid warfare in his thesis for the Naval Postgraduate School in 2002. In studying the Chechen War from 1994-1996, Major Nemeth referred to "the flexible, half regular, half irregular warfare that relied on conventional arms, methods of terrorism and organized crime, and irregular warfare" as hybrid.

However, the term hybrid threat became a commonly used term after the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah War, and attempts to explain the complexity of twenty-first century warfare, which involves a multiplicity of actors and blurs the traditional distinctions between types of armed conflict and peace. Dr. Frank Hoffman, who at the time was a Research Fellow at the Center for Emerging Threats and Opportunities (CETO) at the US Marine Corps Combat Development Command, posed one of the earliest accepted definitions of hybrid warfare which emerged after the Israeli-Hezbollah War. Hoffman wrote that hybrid wars "incorporate a range of different modes of warfare, including conventional capabilities, irregular tactics and formations, terrorist acts including indiscriminate violence and coercion, and criminal disorder."

Dmitry Adamsky, and Associate Professor at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy, and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center at Herzliya, Israel, argues that American, European, and Israeli combat operations in the Middle East form the conceptual base and intellectual inspirations for creating the hybrid warfare concept. 
15
16
However, analysis reveals that Russian New Generation Warfare, their doctrine under Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, maintains many similarities to Western definitions of hybrid warfare. Gerasimov, in an article he published in VPK in February 2013, outlined his perspective on future operations, stating that future conflicts would emphasize "the broad use of political, economic, information, humanitarian and other non-military measures, taken along with the use of the population's protest potential."

After the Vietnam War, and in the midst of the Cold War, the US Army shifted its doctrinal focus back to conventional state-on-state operations. From AirLand Battle, published in 1986, to Full Spectrum Operations, published in 2001, Army doctrine gave little attention to unconventional forms of warfare. 
19
In 2010 the Army's Training and Doctrine (TRADOC) G2 published TC 7-100, Hybrid Threat. The TRADOC G2 maintains a Threats Integration Section whose mission includes the study, design, and documentation of Operational Environment (OE) conditions to support US

The manual devotes a chapter to address how hybrid threats accomplish their objectives in its chapter entitled Hybrid Threat Strategy. It notes:
Strategic operations apply all four instruments of power, in varying combinations depending on the conditions. In most cases, the diplomatic-political, informational, and economic means dominate. During strategic operations, military and/or paramilitary means are most often used to complement those other instruments of power to achieve hybrid threat goals. 
25
It is also notable that the manual approaches hybrid threat from a highly conventional perspective. For example, when describing how to defeat hybrid threats, the manual states:
Major combat operations (MCO) employ all available combat power (directly and indirectly) to destroy an opponent's military capability, thereby decisively altering the military conditions within the operational environment. MCO usually involve intensive combat between the uniformed armed forces of nation-states. Hybrid threats may have the capacity to engage in MCO . . . each separate actor and action of a hybrid threat can be defeated if isolated and the proper countermeasure is applied. 
26
In December 2011, the TRADOC G2 published its Decisive Action Training Environment (DATE) Manual 2.0. The manual is a fictional composite model that represents the conditions that exist within the complex real-world environment. The manual depicts five countries and portrays a full range of potential threat capabilities, used to drive training for Army units both at Combat Training Centers (CTC) and at home station. 
27
However, in its description of the threat, it fails to address the threat's cognitive underpinnings.
It is noteworthy that the Army uses the term hybrid threat throughout its doctrine, and does not use the term hybrid warfare. While the distinction may seem trivial, it may explain why Army doctrine describes hybrid threat in terms of capabilities, and fails to explain the conceptual nature underlying hybrid threats. In the field of psychology and linguistics, linguistic relativity holds that the semantics of a language can affect the way in which its speakers perceive and conceptualize the world, and in the extreme, completely shape thought, a position known as determinism.

However, the definition of warfare implies it is about the actual conflict between entities. The term hybrid warfare implies the subject is in the very nature of the conflict between entities.
Merriam-Webster defines nature as the inherent character of something.
34
It is important to highlight what is meant by holistic. A good definition for holistic, as used here, is the idea that the whole is more than merely the sum of its parts. 
35
The new "whole" cannot be understood simply by counting the pieces that went into its construction, it must be viewed as its own unique system, built for its own unique purpose.
Hybrid warfare, then, is more than just the sum of the capabilities, resources, or tactics that it encompasses. It is something different, which emerges for a unique purpose.
Several recent conflicts serve as good examples to show how hybrid threat is more than just the application of unconventional, non-traditional, or blended tactics and capabilities. The examples presented here will show that the actors employed hybrid warfare as a matter of strategic choice and leveraged beliefs, values, norms and behaviors to their advantage. A good starting point is the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah War, which provided a significant impetus to the discourse about hybrid threat in US military.
The 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah War, also called the July War, began on July 12, 2006 when Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) invaded Lebanon after Hezbollah kidnapped two IDF service members to precipitate a prisoner swap for Hezbollah members held by Israel. Israeli forces bombarded Hezbollah targets in Lebanon for weeks, and Hezbollah launched close to 4,000 rockets into Israel. 
36
Military operations ended on August 14 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. The conflict induced a heavy toll on the IDF, Hezbollah, and civilians in both Israel and Lebanon. In the end, however, both sides crafted narratives declaring victory. Hezbollah killed 116 Israeli soldiers and forty-three civilians, and was still firing rockets on northern Israeli settlements after the ceasefire began. 
37

Hezbollah assessed that any future Israeli offensive action would rely heavily on air and artillery bombardment, limiting the commitment of ground forces to mitigate casualties. Therefore, it needed the offensive capability to penetrate well into Israel's border and mitigate 
39
However, in order to ensure maximum protection of its rocket forces, Hezbollah also mixed more conventional military tactics with its exploitative unconventional tactics. In order to protect its rocket forces from and IDF ground incursion, Hezbollah surrounded its rocket sites with underground tunnels and bunkers, explosive-ridden areas, and anti-tank units. The Hezbollah forces manning these defenses were armed with conventional anti-tank missiles and trained to conduct anti-tank ambushes in Iran and Syria. Mines and improvised explosives devices (IED) were emplaced in defensive belts to disrupt IDF mechanized forces, allowing Hezbollah to mass indirect fire on halted IDF convoys. These obstacles were intended to delay IDF ground forces and inflict as many casualties as possible, further capitalizing on Hezbollah's assessment that Israeli society would be intolerant of high casualties. 
44
45
The Israeli military possesses formidable capabilities in the region, thus is easily portrayed as heavy-handed in their use of force. Matthews uses the analogy of the biblical story of David and Goliath, noting that Hezbollah portrays Israel as Goliath, making it easy to portray itself as David.

exploited regional and world opinion to shape perception of both Hezbollah and Israel. It used the concept of narrative to its own strategic advantage.
Image can be a powerful tool when employed in the strategic context. Hezbollah is very careful to cultivate its image as a protector of the Muslim faith, even though they are Shia and rose from the export of the Iranian Revolution. One of its primary strategic narratives is resistance to Israeli and Western onslaught, portraying its members as true defenders of Arab society and the Muslim faith sacrificing themselves for the greater good. Unlike democratic Israel, Hezbollah is not subject to "the harsh audit of a free press and a competitive political process."
49
As noted, Hezbollah emerged from the 2006 conflict with Israel in a better position politically than when it had started. This is attributable to the fact that Secretary Nasrallah set a realistic goal from the beginning, even stating that mere survival would be victory, and framed the conflict using the narrative of Hezbollah as the vanguard of a Lebanese national resistance, who withstood Israel's coercion. 
50
Hezbollah also sought to exploit time as a weapon against Israel. The Muslim concept of time relative to war takes a more long-term approach than the Western conceptualization, hence Hezbollah views their struggle with Israel as a long-term effort. Hezbollah believed a victory over Israel was preordained and required patience and a prolonged commitment. Noting Hezbollah's assessment that Israel was averse to a long commitment resulting in significant casualties, time was on Hezbollah's side. They understood Israel's aversion to attrition to the point of unwillingness to suffer casualties, and designed their strategy and operational approach to prolong the conflict and outlast the IDF. Hezbollah's strategy was to attack into Israel using its arsenal of rockets to weaken Israeli resolve while defending against Israeli attacks from wellprepared positions in southern Lebanon to delay the IDF, prolonging the conflict to support strategic narratives and sway world opinion.
Hezbollah also understood the value of operational shielding. Hezbollah fighters utilized the tactic of "hugging" or hiding amongst civilians designed to force IDF soldiers to abstain from attacking due to fears of causing civilian casualties and collateral damage. Hezbollah fighters often wore civilian dress and blended in with the civilian populace, and often used residential structures for firing positions, storage facilities, and hiding sites. Videos emerged showing Hezbollah fighters placing rocket launchers next to residential buildings and hiding them in residential garages. These tactics were part of a larger strategy designed to exploit Israeli values.
They also assisted Hezbollah's propaganda campaign. When the IDF did cause civilian casualties or collateral damage, Hezbollah quickly capitalized by showing images of the casualties or damage on its media outlets. This all played into Hezbollah's larger strategy of weakening Israeli resolve and international support for Israel.
According to Patrick Porter, the IDF erred in its initial assessments of how Hezbollah would fight. The Israelis entered the conflict with plenty of combat experience, both on the conventional side fighting its Arab neighbors, and fighting groups in its occupied territories who employed a variety of unconventional tactics. However, as Porter notes, the differences were dramatic between combating Palestinian irregulars in the West Bank and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

In 2014 Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory, taking control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and in Eastern Ukraine. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after a referendum in which Russia claims Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation. Eastern Ukraine is still gripped in armed conflict between Ukrainian Government Forces and those backed by Russia. Russia successfully blended conventional military tactics and capabilities with non-military means and ways to successfully annex the Crimean Peninsula and control key areas of Eastern Ukraine, highlighting the distinct aspects that challenge our current definitions and understanding of hybrid threat.
As Russian actions in Crimea are discussed here, it is important to bear in mind that many of the actions taken by Russia were possible because of distinct characteristics that exist in Crimea. In other words, Russia's actions in Crimea do not represent a generic model of hybrid warfare that are applicable in other situations. In fact, critics of many Western definitions of hybrid threat often note that the current depictions fail to understand that conditions that are unique to each conflict. The successful pursuit of Russian objectives in Crimea were aided by a largely pro-Russian civilian population, the presence of Russian military installations on the Russian disposition among many in the target population, and would not produce the same results in different contexts where pro-Russian sentiment was less certain.
Crimea was an autonomous republic in the Republic of Ukraine but had a population that was 60 percent ethnic Russian. This is due in not only to Crimea's history as a once-Russian territory, but also to deliberate Russian efforts to shape the environment. Crimea was not only important to Russia for historical reasons, but for strategic ones as well. The Russian Black Sea naval base, located on the Crimean Peninsula, provided access for the Russian Fleet to the Black and the Mediterranean Seas. The Black Sea Fleet base affected the ethnic and social structure of the Crimean Peninsula. Russian citizens who were called into mandatory military service who served in the Crimean Peninsula often stayed in Crimea when their service was over. 
59
60
Russia exploited these conditions to foment unrest amongst the populace directed at the Ukrainian government as early as 1992.

Shortly after, uniformed Russian servicemen, however bearing no unit insignia, began securing key sites on the Crimean Peninsula; many of the same sites that Russian plain-clothed special forces troops and Russian-supported criminal groups had seized. These uniformed troops began helping local civilians, taking pictures with women and children, and generally behaving politely and establishing good relations with the civilian populace.

Recall both Hoffman's definition of hybrid threat and the US Army's definition in doctrine include the element of criminal threats. US Army doctrine does not elaborate on the use of criminal threats, nor how it will manifest itself. Hoffman, in his more detailed explanation of the element of criminal threats, explained that criminal activities are intended to cause disorder and chaos within the zone of military actions. 70 However, in Crimea, the actions of non-regular 66 Emmanuel Karagianis, "The Russian Interventions in South Ossetia and Crimea Compared: Military Performance, Legitimacy, and Goals," Contemporary Security Policy 35, no. 3 (2015): 408.

Russian military authorities controlled the activities of these entities, and employed them to attack strategic objectives, not to inflict chaos.

In Ukraine, Russia successfully used this technique to prevent the US and its European allies from intervening with military force, allowing Russia to continue its efforts to disrupt and influence Ukraine through both military and non-military means. Russia exploited pre-existing dispositions among its adversaries and persuaded leaders in the West to do what they already wanted to do in the first place, namely to remain on the sidelines as Russia dismantled Ukraine.

Russian military facilities in Crimea to portray Russia as an interested power rather than a party to the conflict. This approach has achieved positive results for Russia, allowing it to sideline the West and gain time to build and expand its own military involvement in Ukraine. It even managed to sow discord within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as members were unable to agree on how to respond. 
79
As noted earlier, hybrid warfare contains an element of learning and understanding each situation in its own unique context. The socio-cultural conditions in Crimea differ markedly from those in Eastern Ukraine. Russian authorities understood this. In Crimea, Russia exploited the unique conditions to rapidly achieve their strategic objectives. In Eastern Ukraine, Russia has taken a much different approach. Andrew Monoghan, a Visiting Fellow at the Changing Character of War Program at Pembroke College in Oxford, notes that categorizing Russian actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine together under the umbrella term of 'hybrid warfare' draws a veil over the more conventional aspects of the war in Eastern Ukraine. 
80
During these battles, massed artillery strikes were used to considerable lethal effect against Ukrainian military forces. 81 79 Snegovaya, "Putin's Information Warfare in Ukraine," 2. Gerasimov stated, they note, is the increasing importance of non-military tools in conflicts, including political, economic, informational and humanitarian. 
82
83
83
Gerasimov's writings, represented a Russian model of hybrid warfare that could be applied universally in other theaters.
Just as Hezbollah did in Lebanon, Russia understood the importance of exploiting values for strategic purposes. Russia leveraged cultural ties to foment discontent and undermine its Ukrainian adversary. Russia also understood how to capitalize on behavior to achieve its strategic ends. It not only employed reflexive control to influence its adversaries in Ukraine, but also knew how to keep the level of conflict below a threshold that would provoke a NATO military response. As noted earlier, hybrid warfare is a learning contest, and dangerous violent extremist organizations like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda learn from these conflicts as well.
In 2014 the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) overtook large swaths of terrain in Northern Iraq and Syria, defeating Iraqi military units in large-scale combat operations, capturing a tremendous amount of conventional military equipment in the process. This marked a significant point in the evolution of Al Qaeda in Iraq then ISIS, from an insurgent group fighting in Iraq against the US occupation and the newly formed Iraqi Government in the early 2000s, to a transnational group using hybrid warfare to establish an Islamic caliphate. Although Iraqi Security Forces, with the help of the United States and other coalition partners, has retaken much of the territory seized by ISIS in 2014, ISIS has demonstrated an acute ability to modify its composition and tactics, blend modes of warfare, and exploit information in both the regional and international arenas to survive.
The blending of conventional and unconventional tactics and equipment that ISIS employed clearly fits within earlier definitions of hybrid threat, such as Hoffman's. ISIS blended its military actions aimed at securing terrain with terror attacks targeting civilians in Iraq, Syria, and abroad. It has committed acts that have drawn international condemnation such as the mass murdering of civilians, looting and pillaging, and the destruction of cultural icons. Scott Jasper and Scott Moreland, both faculty members at the Naval Postgraduate School, in an article about ISIS as a hybrid threat, expanded upon Hoffman's earlier definition of hybrid threat, adding the concepts of terrorism and disregard for international law. They note that hybrid threats may utilize terror campaigns to proliferate hate and strike fear against cultures, identities, and beliefs that oppose their own. They further note that hybrid threats often cynically view international laws as a constraint upon their adversaries that can be exploited. 
84
In its assault to seize Mosul in June 2014, ISIS forces numbered between 500 and 800 fighters, and traveled in 150 vehicles in conventional formations. Their formations blended civilian vehicles and captured military vehicles. In subsequent assaults in Baiji and Tikrit, ISIS deployed over 60 tactical military vehicles. 
85

As Jasper and Moreland note, the disregard for international law has been a hallmark of ISIS' strategy. In fact, more than merely displaying their own disregard for international law, ISIS attempts to exploit its adversary's values and regard for international norms and statutes.
Again, it is important to understand this contextually. What Western law prescribes is often different than what Islamic Law prescribes. And even ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law is not consistent with how many Muslims choose to observe Islamic law. ISIS placed civilians within its convoy of 500 vehicles to deter coalition airstrikes as it fled the city of Manbij in northern Syria in August 2016. 
91
92
93
Globalization has lent itself not just to the transfer of military thought on strategy but has also contributed to the proliferation and exploitation of criminal activity to support hybrid wars.
In 2014, ISIS took in over $2 billion, much of it from selling oil from seized oil fields on the black market. 
94
Additionally, in Afghanistan, even after over a decade of war and eradication efforts by the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF), the Taliban still earn about $400 million annually from the production, cultivation, and exportation of opium.

hybrid threat is a strategy, and though some hybrid threats may share common building blocks, each contains its own unique logic with its own system of reasoning applicable to its context.
Hashim Wahdatyar, of ACCION International in Washington DC, wrote that one needs to "be cautious in simply defining a hybrid adversary as any that engages in multiple forms of warfare because this can include just about every type of organization from criminal gangs to the German Wehrmacht." 97 History is replete with examples of armed conflicts in which one or more of the belligerents employed a variety of capabilities to achieve their goals. It seems only natural that a force would use any and every means available to it to achieve victory. As US military analysts studied recent conflicts in the early twenty-first century and developed a model of future threats the US military would confront, they developed a theory of hybrid threat. However, the problem with models is that their focus is on sameness. In other words, they seek to create a representation that applies universally, which fails to account for the unique context of each situation. Another pitfall, as Christopher Bowers notes, is that they set the aperture too wide in identifying who and what hybrid threat is. 
98
99
Prussian theorist Carl von Clausewitz described war as an extension of policy, noting its nature and character are shaped by the aim of the underlying policy, when he wrote "war is an act of force to compel the enemy to do our will…war is merely the continuation of policy by other means." 100 Thomas Mahnken developed a concept he called strategic culture, which describes patterns of strategic behavior exhibited by an actor, either state or non-state, and includes the set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior derived from common experiences and accepted narratives that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.

104
If we are to understand hybrid warfare, we must view it as a strategic concept which develops from the aggregation of beliefs, values, norms, and behaviors of the entity that employs it, which seeks to exploit those same characteristics in the adversary. We must understand that future conflicts will be complex, and that no one model will fit universally. Though we may be able to identify some tactics or common characteristics of future threats, we must also acknowledge that there will be unique characteristics derived from the very essential nature of the threat. Therefore, understanding hybrid warfare requires us to change our mindset. It requires us to move away from reliance on doctrinal descriptors and universal models, towards a mindset where we embrace  or at least accept  complexity. It requires us to acknowledge the importance of knowing our enemy rather than merely knowing how our doctrine dictates we fight. As Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu stated in The Art of Warfare, "he who knows the enemy and himself will never in a hundred battles be at risk; he who does not know the enemy but knows himself will sometimes win and sometimes lose; he who knows neither the enemy nor himself will be at risk in every battle." 105 105 Sun Tzu, The Art of Warfare, trans.
