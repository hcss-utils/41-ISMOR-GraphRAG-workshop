Yet the ravages of war for Russia cut too deep.
Popular discontent and agitation against the war raged, enabling the small but highly organized Bolshevik Party to seize power and to win enough public support to govern, at least in the larger cities and nearby regions.
The leaders of the Bolsheviks, especially Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, thundered against the capitalist nations and blamed the war on imperialist competition, which they said was the inevitable outcome of capitalism.
They vowed that their revolution would overturn capitalism throughout the west and replace it with a more humane and just system run by and for ordinary workers and peasants.
When the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace treaty with Germany that took Russia out of the war, enabling millions of German troops to be transferred to the western front, thereby jeopardizing the entire Allied position, Wilson's hope for a speedy end to the war and a new global order was profoundly endangered.
The US, Allies (and Japanese) were so frightened by the communist revolution that they even redeployed troops into Russia itself in an effort to strangle the Bolshevik hold immediately.
This effort failed, but undoubtedly constituted the fi rst blow in what would eventually become the Cold War.
