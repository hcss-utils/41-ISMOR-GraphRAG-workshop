Although they are not explicitly documented in the Russian military-scientific literature, we can nevertheless speculate about the types of lessons the General Staff may have learned based on the observable events related to the seizure of Crimea and Russia's military operations in eastern Ukraine.
First, General Staff leadership may have observed that the military's use of secrecy and deniability can prove operationally advantageous when used in limited, tightly scoped operations, as was the case in Crimea.
However, this secrecy also placed significant constraints on the Russian General Staff's orchestration of the conflict in the Donbas.
By continuing to publicly maintain the narrative that the conflict in eastern Ukraine was a civil war-in which Russian regular forces had no part-the Russian military establishment was forced to work with and through proxies and others.
These proxies and other actors were not directly subordinate to the General Staff, which would have been the case had the operation been conducted in a more overt, conventional manner.
