This thesis will help policy makers and strategists in the United States and its allies and partners better understand how to address the Russian threat in disputed waters.
In the current geopolitical environment, a conflict between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia in the Black Sea would be costly, could escalate dramatically, and would distract the United States and the United Kingdom from the "pivot" to East Asia at time when they are positioning themselves to counterbalance the rising Chinese military threat.
The United States and the United Kingdom, therefore, must have a coherent policy and strategy that efficiently deters the Russian maritime threat.
Through examination of how and why military interactions in the Black Sea have evolved, this thesis aims to provide insight for future policy makers and strategists so they can better craft maritime policy and strategy to address the Russian threat in the Black Sea, the Arctic, and the Sea of Japan.
