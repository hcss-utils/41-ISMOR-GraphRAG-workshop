Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov added to these concepts with what has since become known as the Gerasimov Doctrine.
The Gerasimov Doctrine rose to prominence soon after Russia seized the Crimea and Eastern Donbas regions from Ukraine in 2014.
Like the Chinese, Gerasimov believed the lines between war and peace had blurred.
As a result, "wars are no longer declared and having begun, proceed according to an unfamiliar template.
"6 F 7 This template includes harnessing social media to spread propaganda and the merger of state and terrorist, or in the case of Ukraine, proxy forces.
Further, the Gerasimov doctrine shrinks the distance between the strategic and tactical levels of war as capabilities and authorities are pushed to lower tactical formations.7 F 8 Given the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) uneven response, Gerasimov might have added the cloak of deniability, for Russian's actions in Crimea were executed in such a way that the status quo changed before Russia was officially linked to the conflict.
Although international relations scholar Bettina Renz believes the hype surrounding "hybrid warfare" is an oversimplification of Russia's strategic approach, the Gerasimov Doctrine highlights a major theme in the changing character of war.8 F 9
