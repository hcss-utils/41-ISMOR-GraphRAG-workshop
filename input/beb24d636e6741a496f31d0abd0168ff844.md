On a more positive front, Ukraine's response shows how efforts to combat disinformation start with limiting misinformation.
Although proving its effectiveness remains difficult, Ukraine's One Voice Policy at least minimized Russia's opportunities to exploit the Ukrainian government's confusion.
This is an important accomplishment because Russia often based its disinformation on partial facts to lend credibility to its narrative.
Russia's disinformation efforts in Ukraine also showed the downsides to secrecy; Russian disinformation would often fill the voids left-deliberately or accidently-by the Ukrainian government and military.
For USAF and the joint force, both lessons are relevant: Getting one narrative out in the public early and generally being as transparent as possible are strong and required first steps in fighting any sort of Russian disinformation efforts.
