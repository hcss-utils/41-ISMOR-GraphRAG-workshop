Nonetheless it is imperative to understand that Russia is not the sole proprietor of hybrid warfare.
Russian actions have many implications not only for Europe and the United States, but for nations and polities the world over.
The Russian model of hybrid warfare illuminates several critical innovations to warfare that transpired while the United States was committed to operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout many other parts of the world.
The most powerful implication is not necessarily in a resurgent Russia, but in providing the world with a modern approach to warfare that merges the instruments of national power within operational design-all of which is nested in time, space, and purpose to achieve political objectives.
The approach aggregates Information Age technology within this construct in an effort to achieve victory without the formal commitment of forces.
Information Age technology can cover a wide variety of items, but for purposes of discussion herein, Information Age technology includes improvements to information and communications technology, nascent and improved cyber and electronic capabilities, and improved anti-area/area-denial capabilities.
In short, hybrid warfare is a bourgeoning theory of warfare that exploits adversarial vulnerabilities.
