Russia's use of hybrid warfare challenges the West to counter actions that often appear ambiguous and obscure Moscow's hand.
While this strategy rarely results in force-onforce military conflict, it still risks undermining the stability and democratic institutions of the nations that Moscow targets, many of which sit between western Europe and Russia.
Moscow has many options for pursuing its goals and hybrid warfare is only one of them, however it may be the one strategy for which the US and the West are least prepared.
