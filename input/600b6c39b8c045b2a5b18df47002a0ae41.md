One of the first disconnects between Schwarzkopf's Central Command (CENTCOM) and the national leadership occurred when Russia attempted to broker a peace deal with Iraq.
The Bush Administration saw the Russian effort as a threat; if it achieved its goal of preventing a ground war many of NSD 54's objectives could not be met.
Schwarzkopf, on the other hand, saw the Russian proposal as an opportunity to avoid American casualties.
The rift between military leaders and policy makers over the Russian proposal was only intensified when it garnered French and even limited Arab support.
Schwarzkopf was pressured to accelerate the timeline and start the ground war before a peace negotiation could fracture the Coalition.
