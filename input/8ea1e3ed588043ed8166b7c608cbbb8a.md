This monograph examines the potential characteristics of a future conflict between nuclear armed adversaries based on the only two historical cases of direct conflict between nuclear powers: the 1969 Sino-Soviet War, and the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan. This paper argues that these two wars suggest five key characteristics of conflicts between two nuclear powers: first, nuclear confrontations are risky and difficult to control; second, information operations and the international community have a significant impact on the outcome; third, military leaders will probably encourage escalation; fourth, military operations will face severe political and strategic constraints, and; finally, horizontal escalation is significantly more destabilizing in conflicts than vertical escalation. Based on these conflicts and characteristics, current US Army doctrine and concepts are ill-suited for future war against nuclear armed near-peer threats because the risk of escalation will require significant political and strategic constraints, and future operations should remain extremely limited in size and scope.
Several potentially significant implications for the United States Army's way of war result from the constraints, limitations, and altered character of war caused by nuclear weapons. First, army commanders, at battalion level and above, will have to assume significantly greater tactical risk to limit and control the risk of strategic escalation. Second, the United States Army will probably have to fight at a much slower tempo and use more constrained methods than typical American operations. Finally, tactical advantages and successes will derive largely from political and strategic advantages achieved from information operations and the international community.

In October 2017, the US Army published the new Field Manual (FM) 3-0, Operations. FM 3-0 serves as the new doctrine for American large-scale combat operations against peer, or near-peer, adversaries and explicitly focuses on America's big four potential rivals: Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.

US Army doctrine and concepts currently display many issues, either ignoring nuclear concerns or pushing adversaries to employ nuclear weapons, and increases the risk of escalation. 
5
Second, Army doctrine espouses many escalatory tactics and concepts to achieve victory.
For example, FM 3-0 encourages traditional aspects of modern American war such as attacking potentially dual-use capabilities including command-and-control functions, integrated air defense systems, integrated fire commands, and even nuclear capabilities.

Conventional American tactics would likely encourage adversaries employing nuclear weapons; those adversaries are already considering how to use nuclear weapons. While Russia maintains a high threshold for nuclear use, Russian doctrine explicitly states that the "Russian Federation shall reserve the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destructionâ€¦ as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy."

China and North Korea are also considering nuclear weapons extensively, and a conflict against either nation could easily cross the nuclear threshold. China maintains a "no first use" pledge, but Caitlin Talmadge has argued that China would likely face extreme pressure to employ nuclear weapons if attacked by an overwhelming American conventional force -especially if China believes the United States desires decisive victory or regime change.

This monograph examines the potential characteristics of a future conflict between nuclear-armed adversaries based on the only two historical cases of direct conflict between nuclear powers: the 1969 Sino-Soviet War and the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan. This paper argues that these two wars suggest five key characteristics of conflicts between two nuclear powers: first, nuclear confrontations are risky and difficult to control; second, information operations and the international community have a significant impact on the outcome; third, military leaders will probably encourage escalation; fourth, military operations will face severe political and strategic constraints, and; finally, horizontal escalation is significantly more destabilizing in conflicts than vertical escalation (see table

The methodology for this paper emphasizes primary and secondary sources from nuclear theory and both the Sino-Soviet War and the Kargil War to examine potential future Foreign Affairs 97, no. 6 (November/December 2018): 45 & 48-49; Morris, "Emerging U.S. Army Doctrine," 30. characteristics of war between nuclear powers. However, there are several necessary caveats for this research. First, because this study explores potential characteristics of a hypothetical future conflict, findings include significant uncertainty. Second, only two historical cases exist, which significantly limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. Third, both cases present challenges for analyzing future characteristics of war between nuclear powers. Both conflicts occurred as part of a historical rivalry within the context of enduring border tensions in remote regions. Further, one, or both, sides in each conflict possessed an extremely limited and immature nuclear capability.
Finally, sources are limited and are often biased. Few sources provide a Pakistani perspective of the Kargil War, and most are exceedingly biased. The Sino-Soviet War remains an understudied topic and few sources exists. Further, many of the sources that do exist are inaccessible due to linguistic limitations or state security restrictions. 
13
Further, many of the caveats are mitigated by drawing only the broadest and simplest conclusions supported by each case to highlight for the future. This paper follows in five parts. The first explains relevant aspects of nuclear war theory.
The second gives a brief historical review of the Sino-Soviet War and highlights key pieces of evidence for analysis. The third examines the 1999 Kargil War and provides further evidence for analysis. The fourth section analyzes both historical cases and highlights the five key lessons, or characteristics, that are relevant for future conflicts or nuclear crises. Finally, the conclusion relates these lessons to current issues and discusses salient implications for the future. Before examining the historical cases, the next section discusses nuclear theory to enable a better understanding of several key concepts.
Much of today's thinking about nuclear war, and deterrence, is based on unproven theories.

Understanding the theory, and historical examples, generally indicates that fighting a war against a nuclear power, even a limited conflict, would be exceedingly difficult and heavily constrained.
Nuclear deterrence theory's central argument is that nuclear weapons induce caution in international behavior and reduce the likelihood of any direct conflict between nuclear-armed states because both potential adversaries are vulnerable to nuclear attack.

The "stability-instability paradox," first coined by Glenn Snyder, examines if mutual nuclear possession, and a stable relationship like mutually assured destruction, encourages, or permits, aggression and war below the nuclear threshold in the belief that neither side will employ nuclear weapons.

The concepts of vertical and horizontal escalation are also relevant to the two case studies. Escalation is "an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s)

The United States often combines both vertical and horizontal escalation in war by increasing capabilities and force structure, and expanding conflict objectives or linking problems together.
Understanding the basic outlines of these theories and concepts is critical for gaining insights into potential future nuclear conflicts. As Carl von Clausewitz explained, theory is an important prism to examine history through when conducting a critical analysis.

The 1969 Sino-Soviet War was caused by broad ideological and political tensions, but clearly demonstrates the limited nature of conflict between two nuclear powers. The Sino-Soviet War depicts the significant risks of miscalculation or inadvertent escalation, and difficulty in controlling a crisis once it begins. Military leaders on both sides encouraged escalation, and horizontal escalation nearly caused the crisis to spiral out of control. International actors and information operations were also critical influences on the conflict and the eventual negotiated peace. The limited nature of the war, risk, and external influences are all visible in the severely constrained military operations and strict control exercised by political leadership during the crisis. These constraints and influences significantly impacted the nature of military operations in 1969 and contributed to the complex strategic environment.
The evolution of Sino-Soviet relations leading up to 1969 is complex and varied, ranging from deep military and economic cooperation to outright hostility. While the relationship between Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong was functional, though sometimes tense, relations declined precipitously under Nikita Khrushchev.

As the crisis began to escalate, Moscow returned to diplomatic engagement. 112 However, fog, friction, fear, and paranoia took hold in Beijing. Before the crisis ended, China was convinced that the Soviets were launching an attack three separate times. First, on 11 September, after agreeing to a high-level meeting at the Beijing airport, Chinese leaders became convinced the Soviets would use the opportunity to attack with commandos and nuclear bombers.

Following the 1969 Sino-Soviet War, the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan is the only other historical case of war between nuclear powers. The Kargil War demonstrated many of the same characteristics as the Sino-Soviet War. In 1999, escalation remained a risk and was difficult to control, military leaders on both sides encouraged escalation, and concern over horizontal escalation increased conflict instability. The international community and information operations played a similarly decisive role in constraining the conflict and enabling India's success. Finally, political leaders exercised strict control over military operations and severely constrained the military's actions on both sides. These constraints had a dramatic impact on the

125
character of military operations. However, understanding the Kargil War requires grasping the complex and historic rivalry between India and Pakistan.
The Kargil War has a complex history rooted in the enduring rivalry and competition between India and Pakistan over the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir, as the region is commonly called, became, and remains, important for three primary reasons: geography, ideology, and psychological or political value.

Indian resolve while degrading the intruders' capability and morale, increasing Indian morale, and providing significant logistical support. 172 By July 12, 1999, when Operation Safedsgar ended, the IAF had conducted over 1,700 strike, escort, and reconnaissance sorties, approximately 460 defensive sorties, and 2,474 helicopter logistical sorties.

After the conflict began, and India demonstrated the resolve to fight but in a limited manner, Pakistan responded by exhibiting significant restraint. Pakistan limited escalation by curtailing naval operations and restricting air patrols within Pakistan away from the LoC.

The risk of nuclear escalation in 1999 was largely tied to the risk of a broader horizontal escalation and possibility of a large-scale conflict, especially as Pakistan tried to deter India's conventional buildup along the border.

First, nuclear confrontations and crises are inherently risky and difficult to control, and inadvertent escalation can occur easily. In both the Sino-Soviet War and Kargil War, no party desired a wider war or a nuclear conflict. 
219
220
Second, information operations and the international community had a significant impact in both conflicts. The risk of nuclear weapons, and potential global impact of these weapons, forced the international community's attention and involvement. In 1969, international actors conveyed threats and messages to both actors, and served as a check on continued escalation. 
221
233
234
235
236
237
India did not cross the LoC, and limited the forces employed. Further, India notified Pakistan prior to taking any escalatory step, for instance by calling the Pakistani government before the IAF began operations against Pakistani targets on the Indian side of the LoC.
238
233
234
235
236
One of the most significant ways political and strategic leadership constrained military operations was geographically. Each side sought to identify and recognize geographic boundaries and markers that could assist in limiting escalation, such as borders or rivers. 239 Further, each conflict was fought in remote and austere regions with limited access and few strategic interests, which also minimized the risk of escalation. In 1969, China generally limited its operations to Zhenbao Island -which was only one square kilometer -and the immediate area. 
240
241
242
243
244
Another significant constraint employed by all the governments was the size of forces utilized during each conflict. In 1969, China maintained approximately forty-seven divisions on the Sino-Soviet border, while the Soviets had about thirty-one divisions on the border.

These cumulative risks and constraints represent a complex and difficult environment created by nuclear-armed adversaries. Further, each characteristic highlights the dramatic impact nuclear weapons can have on any conflict between nuclear powers. Understanding these characteristics points to several issues in American doctrine and concepts, and several implications for the future.
The analysis of these two historical case studies demonstrates that both the 1969 Sino-Soviet War and 1999 Kargil War display several similar characteristics, which could easily have significant impacts on any future conflict between nuclear powers. This paper argues that these two wars suggest five key characteristics (see table 
1
Based on these conflicts and characteristics, current US Army doctrine and concepts appear ill-suited for future war against nuclear-armed near-peer threats because the risk of escalation will require significant political and strategic constraints, and future operations will probably remain extremely limited in size and scope. Recent doctrine and concepts are primarily focused on large-scale combat operations against great powers. 253 However, large-scale military force is rarely better than a blunt instrument. 
254
8
According to Michael Howard, any future-oriented military doctrine or concept is wrong; the critical doctrine task before war is minimizing egregious errors and enabling adaptation in conflict. 
255
Potentially significant implications for the US Army's way of war result from the constraints, limitations, and altered character of war caused by nuclear weapons. The current US Army way of war emphasizes achieving success by destroying or defeating the "enemy's armed forces and military capabilities" using aggressive offensive operations based on maneuver and 253 US Army, FM 3-0: Operations (2017), Foreword. 255 Robert H. Scales, "Forecasting The Future of Warfare," War on the Rocks, April 9, 2018, accessed February 26, 2019, https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/forecasting-the-future-of-warfare/; Michael Howard, "Military Science in an Age of Peace," Chesney Memorial Gold Medal Lecture, October  3, 1973, printed in The RUSI Journal 119, No. 1 (March 1974): 3-11. the conflict. For example, an adversary with nuclear weapons could hinder US strategic and operational mobility by confining the battlespace to limited areas, denying the option of deep envelopment attacks, and force the army to fight a slow grinding frontal attack with a few battalions and limited fires capabilities. These changes are anathematic to American military leaders, would cause significant consternation, and force a dramatically new way of fighting on the Army.
The final implication is that tactical advantages and successes will largely derive from political and strategic advantages achieved from information operations and the international community. Rather than ground commanders creating their own advantages and success, ground forces will depend on tacitly negotiated advantages and disadvantages from the political level of war. Thus, tactical leaders and strategic leaders will require a closer link than in most conflicts.
Further, the United States will probably have to build a strong international consensus and coalition before fighting a nuclear-armed opponent or face significant international backlash and possible failure. The United States will probably have to wait for active and clear aggression by an adversarial nuclear power to generate sufficient strategic support for action. However, as American adversaries continue operating adeptly below the threshold of war and limiting their overt aggression, the United States' options will remain limited. The state that appears as the aggressor will likely face significant international and information problems -like Pakistan -and ultimately fail as a result. Thus, unless an adversary begins a direct conflict, war in the future will likely continue requiring slow, indirect proxy efforts or extremely limited operations to block "salami slicing" tactics.
Severely limited, small, and possibly indirect proxy wars will require a substantial shift in thinking by the US Army. These conflicts will require deeper integration of strategic considerations by tactical commanders and will significantly change how the Army fights and operates. Not thinking about these changes and challenges ahead of time simply increases the risk of mistakes, and mistakes in a conflict between nuclear powers could easily result in an unthinkable nuclear exchange. In 1898, Ivan Bloch wrote La Guerre Future in which he predicted that war, especially using old methods, was no longer an effective instrument of policy.

Strategically, India must retain the Siachen Glaciers, and uphold its claims and arguments, because failing to do so would significantly weaken India's position in several Sino-Indian border disputes. Further, Pakistani control of Siachen would imply control of the upper Nubra Valley, which would create a threat to Leh, Ladakh, and the Karakoram Pass, making it much more difficult for India to retain Kashmir.

Soviet, and Chinese, threats and messages had a significant strategic impact during the conflict, far outweighing the impact of any military action. Several nations, including the United States, condemned escalatory actions, and the United States mobilized nuclear forces to deter a potential Soviet attack.

Third, political leaders will need to control the tendency of military organizations to push towards escalation. Clausewitz highlighted the concept that war will always trend towards the massed effects to achieve surprise and shock. 256 However, nuclear weapons limit conflict and make destroying or completely defeating an adversary's military infeasible. One critical implication is that army commanders, at battalion level and above, will have to assume significantly greater tactical risk to limit and control the risk of strategic escalation. Strategic risk associated with nuclear weapons will probably force tactical and operational commanders to rethink the idea of risk, success, and appropriate actions. Further, the military, and senior leaders, will have to reframe the idea of military necessity to prevent escalation -such as accepting significant losses, attritional frontal attacks, limited targets and shaping operations, poor maneuver options, and failures. A radical change in risk calculus could easily have a dramatic effect on both the character of war, and how the army fights in a future conflict.
A second implication is that the US Army will probably have to fight at a much slower tempo and use more constrained methods than typical American operations. A slow tempo should allow politicians and adversaries to maintain enough control of the situation to prevent inadvertent escalation. Politicians and adversaries will need time and space to conduct political dialogue, signal each other, and understand the methods of limiting conflict. Further, a slow tempo and restrained methods will emphasize conflict stability and incremental steps towards success. Incremental steps and stability may require not exploiting success, not destroying vulnerable enemy forces, or allowing the adversary to retain significant capabilities throughout
