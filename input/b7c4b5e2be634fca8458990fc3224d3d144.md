Auftragstaktik requires a high degree of mutual trust and the unwavering commitment of every soldier to understand his role and fulfill his duties.
These tenets were assimilated into German military culture over a span of 130 years, beginning with the devastating Prussian defeats at Jenaduring World War II.
See Martin Van Creveld, Fighting Power: German and US Army Performance 1939-1945 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1982), 163.
In his final analysis, Van Creveld described the German army as a, "superb fighting organization.
In point of morale, Ã©lan, unit cohesion, and resilience, it probably had no equal among 20 th century armies."
