While nominally fought on behalf of the South Ossetians and Abkhazians, it is debatable whether the 2008 Russo-Georgian War should be regarded as a proxy conflict per se.
Saakashvili attempted to take the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, attacking the Russian peacekeeping force there in the process.
The conflict that followed was mostly, but not exclusively, an interstate war between Russia and Georgia.
76 While Russian forces displayed some embarrassing shortcomings, they still routed Saakashvili's army within a few days and made it clear that they could take Tbilisi if they wished.
But the conflict was very important in its implications for Russian proxy involvement elsewhere.
It established the precedent that Russia would intervene directly on behalf of its proxies if intervention appeared advantageous, even at the risk of alienating Western powers and other former Soviet states.
In this context, Russian proxy engagement appeared much more ominous and politically potent than before.
