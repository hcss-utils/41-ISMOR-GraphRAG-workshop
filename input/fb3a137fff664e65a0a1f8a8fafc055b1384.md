To defeat Britain, Napoleon developed an alternate strategy: economic warfare.
Brilliant yet unrealistic, Napoleon grossly misjudged the capabilities of his empire to sustain a prolonged embargo against British trade.
Ruining not only France's economy, the System wrecked the economies of satellites and allies as well.
Napoleon's pursuit of defeating Britain above all else, led him down the path of his two greatest disasters: the Peninsula War and the invasion of Russia.
Interestingly, he never viewed the British field army in Iberia as a primary objective, although the empire was focused on destroying the British through the Continental System.
Although London finally offered a conventional target, Napoleon placed greater hope in the unconventional economic war to crush "the little island of shopkeepers."
