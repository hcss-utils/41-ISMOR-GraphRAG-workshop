Overall, this report substantiates the following arguments and conclusions.
Moscow views social media as a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, the novel technology adds another layer to Russia's preexisting anxieties about the West's hostile intentions and capabilities.
At the same time, Russia recognizes the advantages of social media as a lowcost and potentially highly effective weapon of asymmetric warfare.
Its use of this weapon outside the former Soviet Union picked up most markedly in 2014, suggesting that Russia resorted to this tool in part as a response to the West's reaction to the Ukraine conflict.
