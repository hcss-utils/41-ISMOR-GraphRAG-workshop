By F U M I O O T A P rior to World War II the Japanese imperial army and navy lived a cat-and-dog existence.
They individually reported to the emperor and there was no organization to coordinate their efforts.
Their perceived threats and strategies were also different.
The army had traditionally looked north toward Russia while the navy focused on America, especially after the Russo-Japanese War.
Both services maneuvered for larger shares of the budget.
Even war did not bring them closer together.
The navy never informed the army of its crushing defeat at Midway, and the army was preparing to build its own submarines by the end of the war because it did not trust the navy.
