On February 23, 2022, 190,000 Russian military troops and separatist forces invaded Ukraine on its eastern, northern, and southern borders and began their advance toward Ukraine's major cities, including its capital, Kyiv.
629 At the end of March 2022, a month into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military found itself "bogged down in the face of Ukraine's fierce resistance" and began to retreat, presumably to reconstitute its Ground Forces for the "focus toward the Donbas" during the next stage of its "special military operation."
630 During this first month, Russia surprised Western observers of its ongoing military reforms with its poor performance.
On the battlefield, Russian troops struggled to advance their wheeled and tracked vehicles through somewhat muddy Ukrainian terrain; remained clustered and out in the open when stopped; and seemed inadequate at employing armor, infantry, engineers, artillery, and mortars to achieve combined-arms effects, such as maintaining their vehicles and weapon systems and providing logistical support to their forward forces.
631 Russia's Air Force attempted but could not disable Ukraine's military airfields at the beginning of the war, and could not achieve air superiority.
632 Russia's Air Force stayed outside the range of Ukraine's air defenses to reduce aircraft losses.
633 Russian forces also underperformed jointly.
Russia's Air Force "has been unimpressive" with providing close air support to its Ground Forces advancing inside Ukraine and has "generally been carrying out attacks that are disconnected from ground maneuvers."
634 Russia's Black Sea Fleet was able "to provide supporting fires and logistical support to its Ground Forces in the south," but it suffered a significant loss when its flagship battle cruiser, the Moskva, was sunk by Ukrainian forces.
