# Fulltext:
Based on historical lessons learned from irregular warfare case studies, and internal organizational analysis, this thesis seeks to provide Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) with specific implementable recommendations based on Edward Luttwak's concept of relational maneuver. Luttwak defines relational maneuver as a style of warfare that requires a deep understanding of the threat and its operational environment to identify vulnerabilities, adapt, and exploit those weaknesses to destroy the enemy as a system. Luttwak argues that irregular warfare requires effective implementation of relational maneuver to achieve operational and strategic success. The U.S. military's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2009 through 2016 have revealed insufficient use of relational maneuver, favoring, instead, employment of attrition warfare, which focuses on optimizing internal organizational efficiency without understanding, or adapting to, the threat or the operational environment. Through this research, the authors seek to influence MARSOC's organizational strategy to more effectively wage irregular warfare. The final recommendations provide a possible path to MARSOC for overcoming institutional challenges inhibiting the employment of relational maneuver in irregular warfare.
Ultimately, MARSOC's utility to the 2018 NDS lies in applying the principles of relational maneuver to influence strategic objectives in irregular warfare.
China and Russia are now undermining the international order from within the system by exploiting its benefits while simultaneously undercutting its principles and "rules of the road." Both revisionist powers and rogue regimes are competing across all dimensions of power. They have increased efforts short of armed conflict by expanding coercion to new fronts, violating principles of sovereignty, exploiting ambiguity, and deliberately blurring the lines between civil and military goals.

In the Art of War, Sun Tzu famously stated that success in battle depends on knowing the enemy as well as oneself.

The history of war and warfare suggests that irregular wars, such as waging or countering insurgency, require a better discernment of the adversary and its contextual operational environment, unlike traditional interstate conflict in which the U.S. military can primarily focus on the adversary's military force and merely the contextual geographic environment.
Studies like RAND's Paths to Victory indicate that in irregular war the destruction of the adversary's military force, while important, is only one of several supporting efforts requisite for success. 
14
Although the U.S. military pays lip service to understanding the operational environment, the historical record from Vietnam to El Salvador to Afghanistan reveals that the U.S. military has not always effectively understood, confronted, and overcome its irregular threats. Many of the core problems that led to the United States' military and political failures in Vietnam continue to reveal themselves in more recent and ongoing irregular wars. As participants in these conflicts, this study's authors have observed and experienced some of these failures first-hand. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, conventional and Special Operations Forces' (SOF) operational approaches have often gravitated toward attritional short-term lethal effects at the expense of implementing long-term approaches to inform, influence, execute, and achieve political-military strategy and objectives.
The military's ineffective understanding of the contextual political core of operational environments in irregular warfare fuels ineffective attritional approaches. This is evident in historical irregular warfare engagements and persists today, proving that the U.S. military is not adapting to succeed. Success in irregular warfare requires that adaptable task-organized forces develop a deeper understanding of the operational environment, construct and implement unified political-military strategy, and adjust operational approaches to overcome the threat(s) they face. The inconclusiveness, or as retired general officer and author Daniel Bolger argues, the failure of modern U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq indicates a gap of effectiveness in waging irregular warfare.

have used, and will continue to employ, irregular warfare to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities and to threaten U.S. interests. In the two decades since September 11, 2001, author and irregular warfare expert John Arquilla argues that the U.S. military's ineffectiveness in irregular warfare has contributed to destabilizing the international order and producing more irregular threats than existed before the attacks on 9/11.

This internal orientation suggests that the U.S. military has typically gravitated toward what Luttwak defines as an internally focused attritional style of warfare that substitutes nuanced understanding and adaptation with overwhelming military force and firepower.

This study closely explores how Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC)   can and should transform to better implement relational maneuver. As MARSOC and Naval Special Warfare special operations officers, the authors have observed successes and failures over the last decade and have vested interests in their respective organizations' ability to contribute to strategically successful outcomes against irregular threats. While a pure attritional style of warfare may play a more important role in confronting adversaries in traditional wars, it is not the focus of this research. Fighting traditional warfare is the primary responsibility of conventional or general-purpose forces, with SOF in a supporting role. U.S. military conventional forces are generally designed to employ large-scale violent force on the physical battlefield. In contrast, SOF should have a strategic advantage in waging irregular warfare given SOF's relative advantages.
Relational maneuver depends on understanding the operational environment and adapting to protect and exploit vulnerabilities. U.S. SOF commonly state their organizational desire for agility, adaptation, and innovation. For example, as stated in its recently released organizational vision, MARSOF 2030, MARSOC seeks to achieve organizational agility to confront the current and future complex operational environment. 
21
History provides the only evidence by which to understand the current irregular threat environment and to imagine the future thereof. As historian Williamson Murray advocates in The Past as Prologue, this study will examine history to explore how relational maneuver applies to MARSOC in the current and future environment. This history includes three of the most important U.S. irregular warfare experiences since World War II, including Vietnam, El Salvador and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. Analysis of each case assesses the pertinent U.S. military forces' conceptual understanding of the operational environment, political-military strategy, organizational design, and implementation of operational irregular warfare approaches to achieve success.
While historical analysis clarifies the external irregular threats, critical analysis of MARSOC will determine how to transform and enhance their internal organizational effectiveness. To that end, and following Sun Tzu's guidance to know oneself, this study will also conduct an open systems analysis of MARSOC's operational elements using organizational design principles. Comparing the external irregular operational environment against MARSOC's internal environment will provide holistic insight and recommendations for how MARSOC can more effectively employ relational maneuver to wage irregular warfare and influence politically succesful outcomes against current and future threats.
Fundamentally, this thesis uses several basic assumptions. The first is that SOF's very nature requires the employment of relational maneuver principles to be effective due to inherent size and reource constraints. Second, all military units should desire to enhance their organizational effectiveness. Third, since the 2018 NDS outlines specific irregular warfare threats from revisionist, rogue and VEO adversaries, the entire Department of Defense (DoD), Special Operational Command (SOCOM), and MARSOC should more effectively understand the challenges of confronting and overcoming these irregular threats to operationalize many of the concepts within the NDS.
This study's fundamental question asks, how can MARSOC employ relational maneuver to wage irregular warfare more effectively and achieve strategically successful outcomes? The four primary principles that distinguish relational maneuver's effectiveness in irregular warfare provide the basis and analytical framework for this study.
Taken together, these principles and related questions dictate how MARSOC should conceptually understand relational maneuver's employment in irregular warfare: Because the answers to these questions will only provide general utility to the U.S.
military at large, further questions must assist in specifically determining how MARSOC can implement these solutions in the present. Answering the following questions will assist in translating general insights directly to MARSOC:
1.
In comparison to conventional forces, what are SOF's general relational maneuver advantages in waging irregular warfare?
2.
What inhibitors exist within MARSOC organizational design which undermine the employment of relational maneuver within irregular operational environments?
This study determines that, to employ relational maneuver effectively, MARSOC should develop a deeper understanding of operational environments; inform, influence, support, and implement political-military strategy; tailor internal organizational design to meet the challenges of unique irregular operational environments; and implement advisorcentric operational irregular warfare approaches. Together, these four principles can enable MARSOC to identify and exploit the threat vulnerabilities necessary to influence and achieve strategically successful outcomes in irregular warfare. Power

Within the genre questioning general military effectiveness in irregular warfare exists a narrower critique of Special Operations Forces' (SOF) effectiveness in irregular warfare. The core of the argument confronting SOF effectiveness in irregular warfare consists of SOF's overemphasis on the tactical employment of direct-action kinetic skills versus a strategic employment of indirect approaches that harness SOF's abilities to work with and through indigenous partners to achieve lasting political and military objectives.

The literature on irregular warfare and identifying how to wage irregular warfare effectively and counter irregular threats is broad. Due to its purpose to influence MARSOC, an operational military organization, this study uses current joint military doctrine to define irregular warfare as well as key terminology thereof, such as the participants, the activities, and the operational environment.

implications to relational maneuver effectiveness in irregular warfare. Afghanistan veteran and scholar Emile Simpson's illuminating analysis of political competition, based on a Clauswitzian foundation of war and warfare, plays a significant role in shaping this study's examination of the political complexity of irregular warfare.

The core of this study is the application of relational maneuver in irregular warfare to MARSOC. Edward Luttwak's concept of relational maneuver is articulated as a national style of warfare and applied in his writings towards the U.S. military at large. Edward
Luttwak defines relational maneuver and provides the conceptual principles to build an analytical framework to enable the adaptability necessary to succeed in irregular warfare.
This study employs his elements of relational maneuver to examine historical U.S. military experiences in irregular warfare and the irregular operational environment, examine SOF's relational maneuver advantages in irregular warfare, and internally examine MARSOC's organizational design.

Warfighting's way of warfare closely mirrors Luttwak's relational maneuver; however, Warfighting also focuses nearly exclusively on the traditional battlefield, employment of military violence, and the traditional conception of the separation of political and violent competition. Warfighting explains that "at the highest level, war involves the use of all the elements of power that one political group can bring to bear against another. These include, for example, economic, diplomatic, military, and psychological forces. Our primary concern is with the use of military force." 64 This study's examination of relational maneuver's application in irregular warfare indicates that a different philosophy is required. One where the primary concern for MARSOC, and all U.S. military elements in irregular operational environments should be political competition. Veteran and author Emile Simpson's analysis in War From the Ground Up exposes the character of irregular warfare where all levels of warfare require integrating all elements of power. 
65
Aside from Luttwak's concept of relational maneuver and external to the Marine Corps, other variations of maneuver warfare exist. Political scientist John Gentry's 2012
book How Wars Are Won and Lost: Vulnerability and Military Power closely relates to relational maneuver. 
66
67
In "How the Weak Win Wars," 68 Ivan Arreguín-Toft provides a similar argument to relational maneuver that contends that a stronger actor must match the weaker actor's strategy to win. This implies that in irregular war, the United States and SOF must match the weaker adversary and employ relational maneuver to succeed. Toft's argument also focuses on national strategic application. More directly similar to the application of relational maneuver to MARSOC, in 2017 United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) published a series of white papers that included "Expanding Maneuver in the Early 21st Century Security Environment." 
69
Third, this study identifies specific recommendations to adapt MARSOC's organizational design to better align to irregular operational environments.
To examine how the U.S. military has historically employed relational maneuver in irregular warfare, this study surveys literature of the U.S. military's irregular warfare efforts in Vietnam (1954-1973), El Salvador (1979-1992), and Afghanistan (2001-2018).
Since the literature on these conflicts is vast, research will be limited to the most relevant, comprehensive, and well-regarded studies on each conflict. The U.S. military's irregular warfare efforts in Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan are three of the most critical irregular warfare experiences since World War II. These three experiences span nearly 50 of the last 73 years since the end of World War II, took place on three separate continents, and include the full range of military operations in diverse operational environments. These three cases are especially apropos given that they involved Marine conventional and special operations forces and that they all have had profound impacts on U.S. military efforts in irregular warfare. In particular, MARSOC's formative years, starting in 2006, occurred in the context of Afghanistan. Together, these cases enable this study to use its relational maneuver analytical framework to validate the character of irregular warfare and operational environments, to confirm the necessity of employing relational maneuver to wage irregular warfare, and to identify the challenges the U.S. military, SOF, and MARSOC have faced in employing relational maneuver in irregular operational environments.
To determine SOF's comparative relational maneuver advantages in irregular warfare, this study employs a breadth of literature from subject matter experts and credible research. These experts and credible studies include Thomas Adams U.S. Special Operations Forces in Action,

To produce the ultimate organizational recommendations to MARSOC, this study synthesizes literature across a wide range of subjects, each with its own particular literature.
While the breadth of literature is vast regarding broad military and SOF-specific lessons learned in irregular warfare, there is a dearth of literature on how specific SOF organizations can and should implement these lessons to more effectively wage irregular warfare and link tactical and operational effects to strategic outcomes. applicable to analyze any case study or organization interested in or responsible for waging irregular warfare. Lastly, synthesizing the literature that exposes gaps in U.S. military, Marine Corps, and SOF effectiveness in irregular warfare, this study produces an argument that MARSOC should specialize in irregular warfare and applying the tenets of relational maneuver to achieve politically successful outcomes.
To produce the ultimate recommendations to MARSOC, this thesis employs a mixed-methods approach to research. The relational maneuver analytical framework enables case study analysis of Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan. Internal analysis of MARSOC employs organizational design theory through open systems analysis to provide organizational recommendations that MARSOC can implement in the present. Finally, interviews of subject matter experts and the authors' personal experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq supplements traditional academic and official literature.
To enable analysis, Chapter II constructs an analytical framework primarily from Luttwak's conceptual principles but also influenced by the range of literature on war, irregular warfare, effectiveness therein, and irregular operational environments. To enable the adaptability that relational maneuver demands to identify and exploit threat vulnerabilities, the analytical framework consists of four primary components. First, relational maneuver demands a deep understanding of the irregular operational environment, including the threat and the threat context. Second, it requires balancing political and violent competition to inform, influence, and implement a unified politicalmilitary strategy. Third, relational maneuver entails tailoring internal organizational design, particularly of tasks, structures, and its people, to adapt to the needs of the operational environment. Finally, relational maneuver produces adaptive irregular operational approaches that exploit vulnerabilities within the threat operational environment to reach strategic objectives. The entire process requires constant evolution and adaptation to effectively implement. This analytical framework, constructed in Chapter II, enables external analysis of irregular warfare case studies as well as internal analysis of MARSOC's organizational design.
To conduct the internal analysis of MARSOC, this study employs recognized and accepted organizational design theory to conduct an open systems analysis of MARSOC's operational units and levels of command. Open systems analysis will focus on how well MARSOC aligns to the principles of relational maneuver to be operationally effective and to directly support strategic outcomes in irregular warfare. The study's analytical framework provides the measures of effectiveness to examine the internal characteristics of MARSOC. Comprehensively, organizational design theory, the defined irregular operational environment, and the relational maneuver analytical framework enable an open systems goals-based approach to assess organizational alignment with irregular operational environments and to determine areas where MARSOC can better apply relational maneuver.
To supplement case study and organizational design analysis, this study also employs interviews of academic subject matter experts and SOF practitioners. These interviews with individuals such as retired Marine Corps Commandant, General A.M. Gray (Ret), USASOC Commander Lieutenant General Charles Cleveland (Ret), current Special
Operations Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Freedom (SOJTF-OIR) Commander
Major General Patrick Roberson, Major General Ray Smith (Ret), Colonel Gerald Turley (Ret), active duty and retired participants from each case study, current MARSOC organizational leadership, and academic subject matter experts enable insights into the application of relational maneuver in irregular warfare to MARSOC otherwise unavailable.
The authors' personal experiences in irregular warfare across the Middle East further supplement application of theory, traditional historical research, and interviews.
The remainder of this thesis is broken into three parts and eight chapters modeled after Sun Tzu's conditions for success in war: to know one's enemy and oneself.

"To Know One's Enemy" contains chapters II through V. Chapter two builds a conceptual foundation for irregular warfare and relational maneuver and constructs the study's 80 Sun Tzu, The Art of War, 23.  analytical framework. Chapters III through V take this foundation and framework and apply them to Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan. Overall, Part 1 examines the external irregular operational environment, analyzes a variety of irregular threats, and identifies general U.S. military challenges in employing relational maneuver to wage irregular warfare and overcome irregular threats.
Part 2: "To Know Oneself" contains chapters VI and VII. Chapter VI examines SOF relational maneuver advantages in irregular warfare compared to conventional forces.
This chapter reveals how SOF are uniquely suited for the complexity, instability, and uncertainty of irregular warfare. Chapter VII then conducts an open systems analysis of MARSOC's operational elements to identify areas to improve organizational alignment with irregular operational environments and to enable the employment of relational maneuver.
Part 3: "Success in Irregular Warfare" contains chapters VIII and IX, which apply the study's analysis to MARSOC. Chapter VIII synthesizes the externally oriented historical case study analysis and the internally oriented organizational design analysis to produce tailored recommendations for MARSOC. Chapter VIII also contains two sections.
Section A consolidates the primary overarching challenges inhibiting MARSOC. These challenges are synthesized from the external and internal analysis across case study and organizational analysis and apply across the U.S. military and SOF. Section B then applies these challenges to MARSOC and outlines specific recommendations to overcome these challenges. Altogether, Chapter VIII synthesizes the challenges identified throughout the study and applies recommendations directly to MARSOC. Chapter IX concludes by discussing unexpected discoveries, research disclaimers, and further research to implement conclusions from this study as well as expand into topics that this study's scope did not allow.
This study focuses primarily on the U.S. military to provide analytically and historically based organizational recommendations to MARSOC. Since the scope of this study is already large, certain limitations preclude the consideration of some relevant material. Most importantly, the scope of this project limited the number of relevant case studies to three of the U.S. military's most critical irregular warfare experiences between World War II and the present. This thesis explores each irregular warfare effort broadly especially at the theater-strategic and operational levels of warfare, to include U.S.
interagency as well as military efforts to avoid limiting analysis to normative traditional military activities. Because of this broad approach, analysis will remain broad to identify trends within the U.S. military's institutional efforts and deficiencies in applying the principles of relational maneuver to achieve strategic success. Moreover, because this thesis seeks to provide MARSOC organizationally strategic recommendations, analysis primarily focuses on organizations, specifically the U.S. military and MARSOC, and the group level rather than individuals. Certain individuals during analysis, however, will be more thoroughly discussed since their leadership and actions are representative for organizational propensities. This intentional limitation towards individual analysis does not disregard the individual's importance in the U.S. military or within irregular warfare, rather it merely recognizes that strategic success, or failure, in prolonged irregular warfare efforts does not typically occur due a single individuals' competence or failings, but due to teams, groups, and organizations that apply strategy and approaches to achieve success.
Also, this study only explores the role of technology in the most cursory manner.
The literature on irregular warfare, especially for the United States, predominantly argues that the U.S. military tends to overly rely on technology in irregular warfare. 
81
Finally, this study will not cover classified material. This gap limits the depth of discussion and analysis of intelligence and clandestine capabilities within the current environment. An essential element of irregular environments, future research should build on this analysis and carefully examine the conclusions obtained from a sensitive materials perspective. Ultimately, keeping the conclusions declassified will enable the broadest ability to interact with a variety of perspectives and enable thorough and accessible review for implementation by MARSOC leaders and personnel.
This introductory chapter outlines the context, purpose of research, literature review, methods, structure, and scope that guide this study. It is critical for MARSOC, SOF, and the U.S. military to closely study the historical and internal challenges that have undermined effectiveness and success in irregular warfare. The most cursory study of the U.S. military's experiences in irregular warfare exposes profound and repetitive challenges since at least the Vietnam conflict. Furthermore, projections of the likely future threats to the United States, whether from revisionists, rogues, or violent extremists, reveal a predominantly irregular future threat environment.
Through studying the theory and history of irregular warfare, and the U.S.
military's challenges therein, this thesis seeks to enhance MARSOC's direct organizational contributions to overcoming the challenges associated with irregular warfare. The concept of relational maneuver guides this study. Although it is an old concept to which most U.S.
military organizations publicly subscribe, this study indicates that the employment of relational maneuver exists mainly within the traditional domain on physical battlefields.
This study argues that physical maneuver on the battlefield represents the most rudimentary element of relational maneuver, and that more sophisticated applications should integrate the intellectual thought, strategy, organizational design, and operational approaches especially necessary to succeed in irregular warfare. Although some reading the 2018 NDS may too narrowly focus on the sections describing the risks that exist for possible direct interstate conflict between the U.S. and a revisionist or rogue competitor, the indisputable fact is that revisionists, rogues, and global and local insurgent VEOs are waging irregular warfare against the United States right now. Part of the global SOF network charged with understanding, confronting, and overcoming the nation's irregular threats, MARSOC can contribute to this effort by better aligning its organization to the requirements of irregular warfare and better applying the principles of relational maneuver.
Throughout its history, and especially since 1945, the United States has faced numerous irregular warfare threats both directly from irregular non-state groups as well as indirectly from proxies sponsored and supported by other state governments.

In irregular warfare, the U.S. military is often the only force with the access, placement, and capabilities to understand the operational environment and to inform, influence, and implement political-military strategy at every level of warfare.
This chapter re-exposes the historically evident truth that the employment of violence cannot unilaterally produce successful strategic outcomes. The U.S. military, institutionally, either does not understand or does not accept this concept or its implications for U.S. military; that in irregular warfare, the U.S. military must engage in direct political competition and employ violence in support of politics. Specifically, the evidence suggests that the U.S. military has not adapted itself properly to understand irregular operational environments; inform, influence, and implement political-military strategy; tailor its task organization to the environment; and ultimately execute the operational approaches required to produce strategic success. Instead, the historic record reveals that the U.S.  Terrorism,'" (January 19, 2018), https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42752298; Jeff Schogol, "The Next Fight: The Commandant Is Pushing the Corps to Be Ready for a 'Violent, Violent Fight,'" Marine Corps Times (September 18, 2017), https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/ 2017/09/18/the-next-fight-the-commandant-is-pushing-the-corps-to-be-ready-for-a-violent-violent-fight/. 100 Gray, "Irregular Enemies," 13.
understanding of irregular threats and warfare, a lack of coherent political-military strategy, flawed organizational design, and ineffective implementation of operational irregular warfare approaches. Ineffective employment of Edward Luttwak's principles of relational maneuver is the primary cause of the U.S. military's institutional failures in irregular warfare.
To contribute to the wider effort to improve U.S. military effectiveness, this study holistically examines how Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) can better implement relational maneuver to wage irregular warfare more effectively and help achieve strategically successful outcomes. As the newest member of the U.S.
Special Operations Command (SOCOM), MARSOC's organizational youth and development provide an opportunity to break away from traditional attritional paradigms.
To ultimately produce implementable recommendations to MARSOC, this chapter builds a conceptual foundation for war and irregular warfare and produces a relational maneuver analytical framework for further case study and organizational analysis.
The analytical framework identifies four primary components of relational maneuver's application to irregular warfare that enables the adaptation to exploit threat vulnerabilities. 
101
The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgement that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into, something alien to its nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive. understanding what war is, the differences between traditional and irregular warfare, and the philosophies or styles of waging warfare. 
103
The probable character and general shape of any war should mainly be assessed in the light of political factors and conditions.
-Carl von Clausewitz 104
Carl von Clausewitz provides a well-known definition of war. According to Clausewitz, war is competition in which violent force is used to bend an adversary to one's will. 
105
What remains peculiar to war is simply the peculiar nature of its means." 106 Therefore, organized violence, used for a political purpose, distinguishes war from general political competition. Within Clausewitz's definition of war, all warfare is inherently political regardless of ethnic, religious, or other considerations. In terms of strategy in war, violence is the primary means and the objective is to influence a certain distribution of power. In this sense, the inherent composition of all war includes political and organized violent competition (see Figure 
1
According to Clausewitz, the purpose of war is to achieve political objectives. Cold
War-era foreign policy expert Robert Osgood explains that objectives in war can be broken into two simple categories: limited and total war. 
107
We think we can improve our understanding of a subject as diffuse and richly varied as irregular warfare and insurgency by hunting for the most precise definition and subdefinitions. The results all too often are official definitions that tend to the encyclopaedic and are utterly indigestible. Or we discover a host of similar terms, each with its subtly distinctive meaning and probably its unique historical and cultural baggage. So, are we talking about irregular warfare, insurgency, low-intensity conflict, guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and so forth? The answer is yes, and more than those.

Gray, 2007 109

As with the participants and the methods, the targeted political audience is significantly more nebulous in irregular warfare than in traditional warfare. In traditional warfare, the targeted audience is a clearly defined state government and its regulated military. In irregular warfare, the target audience(s) are relevant populations whose role completely depends the war's unique set of circumstances and may include a diverse array of participating state governments and non-state terrorist, insurgent, religious, ethnic, or other relevant political groups. The current joint doctrinal stability publication, JP 3-07, provides six categories of irregular warfare participants: enemies, adversaries, belligerents, opportunists, neutrals, and friendlies. 
117
Regardless of the classification of warfare, state and non-state actors in traditional and irregular warfare both employ violence and political competition to wage war. Therefore, as Colin Gray explains, the nature of war remains the same, but the character can radically differ based on the participants, modes and methods of warfare, as well as the targeted political audience. 
118
Finally, the character of war has also changed due to technological innovations.
Warfare can occur across all domains of time and space (e.g., physical and cognitive) at the doctrinal tactical, operational, and strategic levels. 
119
As Clausewitz explains, it is imperative for policy makers and senior military leaders to determine the "kind of war on which they are embarking." 
121

The way to assess the traditional or irregular character of a threat is to understand the operational environment in relation to U.S. interests. Traditional threats are limited to interstate competitions between state militaries. 127 History exposes that this form of warfare, strictly defined, is seldom found in war. Even a war such as World War II, predominantly characterized by traditional warfare between the great powers, included numerous irregular warfare efforts across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the China and Southeast Asia theater of operations. 
128
The Viet Cong's (VC) main force units and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in Vietnam would often fight in traditional or irregular ways depending on the year and phase of the war. This mix-and-match of warfare methods and the types of actors involved is often defined as hybrid warfare. 
129
Joint doctrine also provides an analytical framework to understand the internal considerations that comprise each participant in an operational environment. The political, military, economic, social, information, and infrastructure (PMESII) characteristics of the operational environment form this framework, which sheds light on the relevant threat and threat eco-system, including neutral and friendly participants, that allows the threat to exist and develop. Analysis of the operational environment and relevant networks must encompass all participants at all levels of warfare and across all domains. Based on the inherent complexity and uncertainty within war, a PMESII analysis should constantly reassess and evolve, since the operational environment is not static and participants will adapt based on the conflictual pressures on their perceived interests and ultimate individual, group, or national physical and ideological survival. Since war typically contains both traditional and irregular elements of warfare, warfare is better thought of as a spectrum of conflict rather than in binary categories. Figure

The consolidated interaction between these four variables requires an externally attuned understanding of the irregular operational environment that only relational maneuver can provide. The four primary variables of the irregular operational environment produce important implications for the U.S. military in irregular warfare.

The potentially immense number of political groups and networks in irregular warfare creates complex and dynamic political competition between participants in fragmented irregular warfare conflicts, such as Vietnam between 1954-1975, El Salvador   1979-1992, and   September 10, 2001, Penguin Politics Current Events (London: Penguin Books, 2005).

Because of asymmetries in power in the current global environment, irregular warfare operational environments tend to threaten U.S. vital interests more indirectly than traditional warfare. 
144
The uncertain character of the irregular warfare environment produces several important implications. First, and most importantly, as the body of doctrine, academic research, and experience in irregular warfare illustrate, political and violent competition occurs at every level of warfare. 
148

156
Fourth, and lastly, uncertainty in irregular warfare elevates the importance of understanding the threat eco-system more than in traditional warfare. C.E. Callwell's classic study Small Wars and the USMC 1940 Small Wars Manual both explain that small, irregular, wars occur in inherently unique, complex, and uncertain operational environments.

Those that seek to practice relational maneuver must subordinate their own preferences to develop whatever capabilities they believe can best exploit enemy weaknesses.

Modern strategists Edward Luttwak and Colin Gray argue that the United States military employs a predominantly attrition style of warfare.

165
Colin Gray's more recent assessment of the predominant American way of war also suggests that the United States employs an attrition style of warfare more readily suited toward traditional warfare. 
167
178
Luttwak explains that effectively confronting complexity, instability, and uncertainty in irregular warfare demands an externally oriented style of warfare that can understand and adapt to the operational environment. 179
The guerilla thus is a relational maneuver response to superior strength.
-Edward 
Luttwak, 2001 180
181
Comparing this style of warfare to the complexity and uncertainty of irregular warfare, it is easy to understand why, short of extermination of entire populations, attrition warfare will not resolve politically complex and uncertain environments that require nuanced understanding to recognize and exploit threat vulnerabilities through politics and the use of violence. Luttwak further explains that "in relational maneuver, as in attrition, the goal is to incapacitate enemy weapons, structures or forces-or indeed the whole enemy entity, but in a radically different way: instead of cumulative destruction, the desired process is systemic disruption-where the 'system,' may be the whole array of armed forces, some fraction thereof or indeed technical systems." 182 Essentially, relational maneuver does not seek to overwhelm the enemy through mass; rather, it overwhelms the enemy through identifying, adapting, and exploiting threat vulnerabilities. 
183
188
As opposed to other descriptions of maneuver, relational maneuver requires four primary components that represent the most holistic conceptual understanding of adaptive maneuver in irregular warfare: 1) developing an externally focused deep understanding of the operational environment; 2) developing and implementing a political-military strategy based on a deep understanding of the operational environment; 3) properly adapting internal organizational design to confront that environment; and 4) implementing adaptive operational approaches to exploit threat vulnerabilities. Listed in numerical order, this process should be considered cyclical and interactive rather than linear, though the two most important elements are understanding and adaptability. All other components are biproducts thereof to exploit external opportunities and protect internal friendly force vulnerabilities.
The contextually unique complexity, instability, and uncertainty of irregular warfare operational environments requires equally unique and dynamic style of warfare.
Short of unacceptable, illegal and immoral, genocidal attritional approaches, strategic success in irregular warfare depends on the employment of relational maneuver. As Figure

The difficulties which arise from this ignorance of the conditions under which the regular army will be operating really divide themselves into two main headings; difficulties arising from want of knowledge of the theater of war, and difficulties consequent upon the doubt that exists as to the strength, the organization, and the fighting qualities of the enemy. Of these the former may be said upon the whole to be the most important as a rule. For it is perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of small wars as compared with regular hostilities conducted between modern armies, that they are in the main campaigns against nature.
-C. E. 
Callwell, 1896 189
Every threat, irregular or otherwise, is unique; however, irregular threats compound the number of variables that must be considered to effectively confront and overcome the threat. In irregular warfare, the complexity extends far beyond military means and centers on the political domain, which includes religious, economic, and political variables down to the tactical level of war. 
190
Understanding the operational environment in irregular warfare follows an evolutionary process that takes dedicated time, attention, and adaptation. In U.S. military terms, the understanding necessary to overcome an irregular threat does not occur in a single seven-month deployment; as the forthcoming case studies reveal, this deep understanding often requires years and multiple deployments to the same operational area.
As understanding evolves and deepens, a military force must also continually adapt its strategy and operational approaches. 
191

This deficit [political centrality into military strategy] results in part from a tendency to focus on tactical issues, troop levels, and timelines, rather than the strategic factors that will determine a successful outcome. The U.S. military has also been reluctant to grapple with the political aspect of war, in the belief that it is either not part of war or entirely up to the civilians to address. Yet an intervention is unlikely to produce lasting results without a strategy that addresses the political factors driving the conflict and provides for enduring postwar stability. Implementing that strategy is likely to involve a combination of military and political means by the United States and local partners acting in concert-such as elections, negotiations, and power-sharing.

RAND, 2014 194
Strategy consists of the interaction of means (the resources at a force's disposal)
and ways to implement an actionable approach to meet the ends (the political-military objective). 
195
Manoeuvre [sic] warfare cannot be fought by standard, general-purpose forces shaped by traditional preferences and bureaucratic priorities. Instead, one must deploy forces especially tailored to cope with a specific enemythat is, forces which are configured to exploit his particular weaknesses, rather than to maximize all-round capabilities. One allows the enemy to dictate one's force-structure and tactics; the 'organizational initiative' is conceded in order to seize the operational advantage.
-Edward 
Luttwak, 1979 204
210
Professionalization enables decentralization and adaptability and mitigates the risk of authorizing tactical level commanders to wage both political and military competition.
Finally, the unique character of irregular warfare requires embedding advisors into partner forces' political-military structures. For the U.S. military, the partner political-military apparatus will determine ultimate success or failure in confronting irregular threats.
Embedded advisors enable the U.S. to maintain the best possible understanding of complex evolving contexts, inform and influence adaption of the current political-military strategy, and enable the operational approaches necessary to achieve strategic objectives. Figure

( the United States and the West, or it may be a local insurgency, as in the case of a local militia group in Afghanistan. Or, as in El Salvador and Vietnam, the insurgency may be tied to a larger proxy war between global or regional powers. Doctrinally, through unconventional warfare or foreign internal defense, U.S. military may provide support to the insurgent, as in 2001 to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, or it may provide support to a partner government as it did to Afghanistan, once the Taliban regime was overthrown.
As earlier discussed, irregular threats often do not directly jeopardize U.S. vital national interests.

RAND defines limited stabilization intervention for irregular conflicts as "smallscale military operations conducted by ground forces (typically supported by airpower) intended to terminate a conflict, either by helping the supported government win or by enforcing a negotiated settlement on terms that are at least acceptable (if not favorable) to the government." 219 Although RAND defines limited stabilization within the context foreign internal defense (FID) campaigns, the same logic applies to a UW effort. In America's current context, any UW effort to destabilize or overthrow a government would likely occur within the larger strategic context of achieving a future better and stable balance of power in in line with U.S. interests. Given the projected future prevalence of irregular conflict, the United States may choose to conduct massive counterinsurgency operations, similar to its efforts in Iraq between 2003 and 2011 and in Afghanistan between   2002 and 2014; however, this  This study emphasizes the operational level of warfare but argues that, in irregular warfare, this level extends into the the doctrinally considered tactical domain. Edward Luttwak explains that "the decisive level of warfare in the relational-maneuver manner is the operational, that being the lowest level at which the different elements can be brought together in an integrated scheme of warfare."
221
222
Because of the highly political nature of irregular threats and warfare, the lowest tactical elements must synthesize political, military, economic, and social-cultural considerations to create an operational approach to overcome the local threat. 
223
Essentially, this operational approach requires developing and implementing a strategy for each unique operational environment. For this study, the tactical level of warfare is limited to individual interactions and single kinetic engagements with the enemy. 
224
While the United States, in the modern era, most often supports counterinsurgents, the U.S. military and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have also supported insurgents across Cuba, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Support to a foreign government typically can take the form of U.S. doctrinal COIN, FID, U.S. led major combat operations (MCO), and security force assistance (SFA).

force to maintain the initiative both politically and militarily.
Using the five overarching principles, an effective operational approach balances political competition and violence against the threat(s) and context across four quadrants (See Figure 
14
230
231
Quadrant three directly targets the threat through political competition. Here both the insurgent and counterinsurgent seek to directly undermine the others' cause and will to fight. This quadrant can include reintegration efforts, infiltration and insider threats, and deception operations.
Finally, the fourth quadrant uses political competition to indirectly attack the threat(s) through influencing the threat's eco-system. This quadrant includes efforts to establish legitimacy among the local population and international audience as well as undermine or magnify grievances. This effort will deny or deter military and political recruitment efforts both locally and globally.  
The conditions of small wars are so diversified, the enemy's mode of fighting is often so peculiar, and the theaters of operations present such singular features, that irregular warfare must generally be carried out on a method totally different from the stereotyped system.

Callwell, 1896 235
The importance of relational maneuver in irregular warfare conflicts with assessments of the U.S. military's predominant disposition toward attrition warfare. This potential misalignment between the United States' prevailing style of warfare and the needs of the operational environment suggests a need to better balance the U.S. military, or at least specific military units, toward relational maneuver. Given the pervasive nature and trend toward irregular warfare in the modern era, relational maneuver should play a central role in confronting and overcoming the irregular threats the U.S. military faces.
Relational maneuver requires an externally focused and adaptive style of warfare with four primary components that enables the agility to identify and exploit threat vulnerabilities. The first component requires a deep and comprehensive understanding of the operational environment to identify exploitable weaknesses within the threat network.
The second component requires a coherent political-military strategy built on an understanding of the operational environment and the level of threat to U.S. interests. Since strategy guides the use of political and military resources to achieve political objectives, the decision to employ attritional versus maneuver principles is inherently strategic. Colin
Gray and Edward Luttwak's analysis of the U.S. military's broad strategy and approaches toward irregular warfare indicates a general lack of strategic thinking, particularly in synchronizing political and military efforts at all levels of warfare. A strategic deficiency has troubling implications for U.S. efforts in irregular warfare, where the essence of the threat within the operational environment is political, and the U.S. military way of war prefers a clear distinction between the use of violence and politics.
Furthermore, the third component adapts internal organizational design to match the operational environment to most effectively understand and overcome irregular threats.
Edward Luttwak argues that inflexibly structured general-purpose forces tend to falter against highly adaptable adversaries due to those forces' propensities to favor an attritional style of warfare that focuses on internal organizational efficiency rather than effectiveness against the operational environment. 
236
Relational maneuver approaches in irregular warfare use five overarching principles to balance violence and political competition both directly and indirectly against the adversary and revolve around the role of the advisor.
The conceptual foundation of war, irregular warfare, and styles of warfare that this chapter presents enables examination and analysis of U.S. irregular warfare efforts.

Relational maneuver provides the analytical lens to investigate historic U.S.
military irregular warfare experiences that can inform MARSOC's current and future decisions. Chapter II, "Relational Maneuver: An Irregular Warfare Analytic Framework," created and outlined a relational maneuver analytical lens to conduct case study analysis.
At its core, relational maneuver employs ones' strength to adapt and exploit vulnerabilities and dismantle the threat system. In irregular warfare, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities depends on holistically orienting on and understanding the operational environment and relevant threats. Due especially to irregular warfare's intrinsic political character, relational maneuver also requires a coherent political-military strategy that fuses 241 Major Bailey's personal experience as a Marine Officer for 11 years. Most representative published account of this internal focus of history is depicted in: General Victor Krulak, First to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1984.) This account of the Marine Corps' history focuses on the internal culture and characteristics of the Marine Corps produced by its struggle to survive as an organization. In 2018, a general officer that spoke to the Marines attending the Naval Postgraduate School tasked all Marines to read First to Fight. This reading assignment was the only reading assignment given.
both political and violent competition together at all levels of warfare. Application further demands an appropriate organizational design to confront the threat by tailoring organizational tasks, structures, and people to the needs of the environment. Lastly, relational maneuver requires operational irregular warfare approaches that exploit adversarial weakness and achieve desired political-military objectives.
Analysis of the U.S. military's efforts in Vietnam (1954-1975), El Salvador (1979-1992), and Afghanistan (2001-2018) provides cases to employ the analytical framework to assess U.S. military effectiveness in irregular warfare. These cases also serve to validate both the analytical framework as well as Chapter II's description of irregular warfare and irregular operational environments. Lastly, the U.S. military's efforts and the environments assessed provide building blocks to continue internal analysis of SOF and MARSOC.
Each case analyzed will include an initial overview of each conflict to include primary participants, general sequence of events, and ultimate outcomes. Following the introduction, each case will use this study's relational maneuver analytical framework to assess the relative effectiveness of the U.S. military's efforts to confront each case's respective threats through relational maneuver. The chapter's conclusion ties each case together through noting significant common trends in effectiveness that the U.S. military should recognize, learn from, and adapt to better achieve strategic outcomes in irregular warfare.

The situation in South Vietnam (SVN) has seriously deteriorated. 1966 may well be the last chance to ensure eventual success. "Victory" can only be achieved through bringing the individual Vietnamese, typically a rural peasant, to support willingly the Government of South Vietnam (GVN). The critical actions are those that occur at the village, district and provincial levels. This is where the war must be fought; this is where that war and the object which lies beyond it must be won.

President Johnson clearly stated these objectives in his "Peace Without Conquest" speech in April 1965:
Over this war-and all Asia-is another reality: the deepening shadow of Communist China. The rulers in Hanoi are urged on by Peking. This is a regime which has destroyed freedom in Tibet, which has attacked India, and has been condemned by the United Nations for aggression in Korea. It is a nation which is helping the forces of violence in almost every continent. The contest in Viet-Nam is part of a wider pattern of aggressive purposes… Why are we in South Vietnam? We are there because we have a promise to keep. Since 1954 every American President has offered support to the people of South Vietnam. We have helped to build, and we have helped to defend. Thus, over many years, we have made a national pledge to help South Vietnam defend its independence. And I intend to keep our promise… We are also there to strengthen world order. Around the globe, from Berlin to Thailand, are people whose well-being rests, in part, on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked. To leave Viet-Nam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an American commitment and in the value of America's word. The result would be increased unrest and instability, and even wider war… Our objective is the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom from attack. We want nothing for ourselves--only that the people of South Viet-Nam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way. We will do everything necessary to reach that objective. And we will do only what is absolutely necessary.

The army bureaucracy tended to view Vietnam as an educational exercise and rationalized the six month rule as a way of seasoning more officers for the "big war" yet to come with the Soviets in Europe and for more of these "brushfire wars." The real reason, which held true for the Marine Corps too and which explained why the practice was derisively called "ticket punching," was a mechanistic promotion process and the bureaucratic impetus this created.

Offensive was almost purely a traditional conventional attack in which significant gains occurred when entire ARVN units abandoned their equipment, fled, and surrendered before the attacks were repulsed with U.S. advisory assistance.

When the U.S. military structured its efforts to combat both conventional and irregular threats, success followed.  SOG's relational maneuver contributions reveals a mixed legacy in Vietnam.
Although a fractional element of the entire U.S. military effort in Vietnam, SOG produced a tremendous kill ratio against communist fighting force of more than 100:1, reportedly tied down significant communist forces in rear areas, and, although suffering high casualty rates, only represented a small cost measured against the casualties inflicted upon the enemy. 399 SOG's attritional success against the communists, however, are counterweighted against its difficulties.

Irregular warfare requires controlling the populations who support either the government or insurgent both materially and with information. The military's failure to prioritize population control resulted in a lack of timely intelligence prior to the 1968 Tet Offensive and enabled the VC to mass and seize significant territory, contributing to the psychological and political defeat of the United States. Furthermore, the political and military failure to counter and deny the communists' safe havens in Cambodia, Laos, and   North Vietnam, until 1970 and 1971, further contributed to the GVN's lack of geographic and political control.

Max Boot, 2018 454
Despite the American near obsession with learning the lessons of Vietnam and applying them to low-intensity conflict doctrine and practice in El Salvador, perhaps U.S. officials once again allowed their efforts to be influenced by an assumption that had proven to be a principal source of our frustration in Vietnam: namely, that it is relatively easy to ensure that an ally does what American policymakers deem necessary to eliminate an insurgency. This has once again proved false. In El Salvador as in Vietnam, our help has been welcome, but our advice spurned.

Schwarz called attention to this deficiency, particularly regarding the acknowledgment of human rights violations committed by members of ESAF and the Salvadoran government.
He wrote, "…in the early years of the Reagan administration some officials had what could most charitably be described as a callous disregard of the sources, intent, and consequences of rightist violence in El Salvador." 
477
480
Schwarz details how the Salvadorans could easily misinterpret the strategic policy message sent from America. His point was that by taking a strong stance against the leftist FMLN in El Salvador and providing $6 billion in government and military aid, the Salvadoran government would likely view that as an endorsement of its status quo of fighting the insurgents with oppressive violence.

ought to have tempered their fear of a Central American state government collapsing to communism, further developed an objective perspective of the situation, and come to a rational decision regarding whether or not to provide assistance. Instead, the U.S.
prematurely committed effort in support of the Salvadoran regime. The hurried origin of U.S. involvement in El Salvador can explain the initial lack of an adequate irregular warfare strategy, but the prolonged absence of a coherent strategy represents a collective failure from the U.S. executive and legislative political branches as well as the U.S. military leadership.
According to the "Colonels' Report," there was no "overarching strategic vision" in El Salvador from the beginning. The colonels wrote that "American involvement in the Salvadoran war took shape without well-defined objectives, a comprehensive plan of action, or a clear appreciation of the resources likely to be required. While there were many effective U.S. programs in El Salvador, in general, they were only effective locally and did not all drive toward a singular end.
Despite financial support from Congress, U.S. military leaders in El Salvador did not feel like Washington was taking the problem in El Salvador seriously. 
502
While the capability to employ military violence to kill insurgents existed, those serving in El Salvador recognized that political, social, and economic reform remained the under-addressed action necessary for winning the war.

Outside of efforts within ESAF and the Salvadoran government, the U.S. military also pursued reconciliation between the general population and the regime. The U.S.
financed civil-military pacification programs that undermined the FMLN and portrayed ESAF and the Government of El Salvador as having the public's best interests in mind.
However, these programs reportedly failed due to the public's lack of trust in ESAF.

and Salvadorans.
The need for a strategy that emphasized the primacy of political competition over violence was evident in El Salvador, just as it was in Vietnam. The similarities between the conflicts are identified in Schwarz' analysis: "the creation of responsive, legitimate government and the winning of the voluntary support of the population through redistribution and reform -and not main-force military operations -were perceived to be the keys to success in the Vietnam conflict, just as they are today in El Salvador." 509 Every conflict is unique, and there are always new lessons to be learned. However, the general concepts have remained the same for generations. To win/reach conflict resolution in irregular conflicts, emphasis must eventually be placed within the political spectrum.
One of the successes in U.S. political-military strategy within the conflict was OPATT helped transition ESAF from a static defense force, protecting critical governmental and economic sites, into a potent counterinsurgency force while also reducing their incidence of human-rights violations.

Another flaw was the lack of control of both funds and policy regarding security assistance. Security assistance funding and policy belongs to the host nation. Funding provided by the U.S. for security assistance was appropriated to and immediately available to El Salvador; the DoD was not allowed to control those funds. In addition, while
Commander in Chief Southern Command (CINCSOUTH) and the MILGROUP commander and advisors provided guidance, the responsibility was ultimately that of the Salvadorans, who made decisions, without, or against the advice provided.

The "Colonels' Report" also outlined the distraction caused by organizational shortcomings,

Many viable political approaches were left unused by the United States for years, including assistance from the United Nations. Schwarz reveals that "until 1990, America did not seek a compromise brokered by the United Nations but pressed for a clear victory through a combination of military and reform measures. In these terms, American policy failed."

Local defense forces were never meant to replace the military or police, but rather to supplement them by slowing the advance of insurgents and notifying the appropriate authorities who can respond with force. Some Salvadoran military officer recognized this, stating that Civil Defense should be "informers not combatants," yet their advice was never heeded. 
548
After improving the tactical ability of ESAF and preventing a military coup by the FMLN, American advisors sought to convince their ESAF counterparts that "winning popular support" should become their new primary focus.

Had U.S. strategy makers or the Salvadoran regime understood relational maneuver or had studied past irregular wars, they would have recognized the necessary transition away from violence and toward a stabilizing political effort. bolstering support for both programs. 566 However, others are skeptical, citing that the insurgents were unlikely to disrupt projects requested by locals, that there was no improvement to Civil Defense after MEA was introduced, and that the definition of "success" was skewed because completion of MEA projects did not lead to trust and support of the Salvadoran government or military. 567
Look beyond the functions of security assistance, training, and advice. Call it war, and having done so, act accordingly.

However, despite the poor understanding and lack of unified effort by President Ronald
Reagan's administration, Schwarz reminds those assessing the conflict that they "must also recognize, however, that it is impossible to imagine any point in the past decade or in the future when El Salvador would not be a far more violent and unjust place, but for the American effort." 569 Some place the blame solely on the Salvadorans as it was their war to win or lose. Schwarz provides a valid rationale for this argument: "In tracing the frustrations of the efforts to reform El Salvador, it would seem that the fault lies not in ourselves, but in the Salvadorans. El Salvador's rightists and its military have often rejected the reforms that America deems necessary to counter the insurgency, and the United States has time and again been met with frustration as El Salvador's armed forces adopt Washington's language even as they ignore its principles." By 1989, those in El Salvador agreed that political reforms to fix the broken justice system and redistribute land were needed to stabilize the country and end the decades-long civil war.

573
Once the U.S. government was no longer fearful of Central America collapsing to communism, it turned over the responsibility of mediation to the UN. 
574
military advisors in El Salvador recognized that establishing legitimate control of the relevant population was the necessary criteria for victory in irregular warfare, the larger U.S. military was yet to implement strategies that align to these ends. Bacevich believes that this mismatch of understanding and practice "will condemn Americans to recurring frustration in future small wars.

When questioned about lessons learned during the Salvadoran insurgency, General
Woerner, then Commander-in-Chief of United States Sothern Command, said "my gut feeling is that there is nothing new."

• Make room for the study of small wars in military schools.
• Clarify organizational responsibilities for fighting small wars, in Washington and the field.
• Overhaul the procedures governing security assistance.
• Before undertaking any intervention, establish a vision of what you hope to accomplish and a consensus of political support to sustain that vision.
• Put someone in charge, vesting that official with real authority.

• Foster institutional change only where it will make a difference.

We had no idea of the complexity of Afghanistan-tribes, ethnic groups, power brokers, village and provincial rivalries. So our prospects in both countries were grimmer than perceived, and our initial objectives were unrealistic. And we didn't know that either. Our knowledge and our intelligence were woefully inadequate. We entered both countries oblivious to how little we knew.

Neither national-level figures nor field commanders fully understood the operational environment, including the human aspects of military operations. To fight, in Rupert Smith's term, war among the people, one must first understand them. We were not intellectually prepared for the unique aspects of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In both conflicts, ethnic, religious, and cultural differences drove much of the fighting. Efforts to solve this problem-Human Terrain Teams and the Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands Program, for example-came too little and too late. Our intelligence system was of little help here primarily because the Intelligence Community did not see this as its mission. The need for information aggregation stands as an equal to classical all source intelligence. Our lack of understanding of the wars seriously retarded our efforts to fight them and to deal with our indigenous allies, who were often more interested in score-settling or political risk aversion than they were in winning the war.

The United States was often unable to knit its vast interagency capabilities together for best effect. The implementation of national decisions by various agencies and departments was a continuing problem for senior officials. The inability to integrate, direct, prioritize, and apply capabilities in the optimal manner diminished success as much as any faulty strategy or campaign plan. The converse is also true: our greatest successes were those pockets of interagency collaboration stimulated by innovative leaders.

Upon taking command in Afghanistan in 2009, General Stanley McChrystal made the rounds of his subordinate units and asked each of us, 'What would you do differently if you had to stay until we won?' At the time I was in charge of operations for a brigade in the middle of tough fight in eastern Afghanistan. It was absolutely the right question, but in retrospect it was also a trick question. The answer was to get the right people into the fight, keep them there long enough to develop an understanding of the environment, and hold them accountable for progress, but that was not something the military was interested in doing. Instead, we stuck with a policy that rotated leaders through the country like tourists.

Exacerbating Lewis Irwin's description of America's "disjointed ways and disunified means" in Afghanistan, the lack of continuity due to short deployment rotations and the U.S. military's institutional failure to dedicate individuals and units to resolve the challenges in Afghanistan perpetuated a cyclical model of relearning old lessons and rebuilding relationships, all of which ultimately undermined effectiveness.

The departments and agencies dislike irregular warfare and resist creating organizations and programs to provide capabilities tailored to its demands." 788
When conventional warfare or logistical skills were called for in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Armed Forces generally achieved excellent results. At the same time, the military was insensitive to needs of the postconflict environment and not prepared for insurgency in either country. Our lack of preparation for dealing with irregular conflicts was the result of a post-Vietnam organizational blindspot.

The U.S. military establishment, with civilian leaders' acquiescence, organized for wars military leaders wanted to fight-not those actually underway. In Vietnam, most obviously, the generals maintained the conventional force structure and tactics they developed to fight the Warsaw Pact and tightly controlled forces well equipped for counterinsurgency operations-like Army Special Forces. Military leaders chose not to learn from experiences in Vietnam, only to find themselves in Iraq and Afghanistan in unwanted counterinsurgency wars they again were unprepared to fight. U.S. government leaders in general, including senior military officers, in the last five cases learned and adapted more slowly than most of their adversaries-with negative consequences for the wars' strategic outcomes.

Analysis of the U.S. military's irregular warfare efforts in Afghanistan reveals significant gaps in employing relational maneuver against irregular threats within a contemporary operational environment. The foundation for the U.S. political-military flaws is a pervasive lack of understanding of the operational environment and threat networks. Afghanistan's operational environment has included a wide range of threats and a complex and dynamic contextual threat eco-system. Based on flawed understanding, the U.S. military has largely pursued a disjointed political-military strategy that initially simplistically focused on al Qaeda without recognizing that denying Afghanistan as a terrorist safe-haven required addressing the array of politically destabilizing factors. Even when the U.S. military largely unified the political-military chain of command by 2012, serious flaws in understanding, strategy, and design remained. Furthermore, the U.S.
military only possessed a relative minority of units that were designed to confront the type of uncertain political-military threats present in Afghanistan.
Overall, even by the time military force began to draw down in Afghanistan in 2011, the military remains poorly organized to pursue advisor-led operational approaches to overcome the threats in Afghanistan. The military did elevate its prioritization of advisors, both political and military; however, many advisory billets remained unfilled, let alone filled with competent personnel. Furthermore, even as the SOF adapted to confront the irregular political challenges through the VSO program, its rushed implementation met with mixed results. Even among SOF, lack of understanding and continuity among leaders and individual units diminished success. Echoing the challenges and failures from Vietnam more than 30 years before, it took military leadership nearly a decade to develop a depth of understanding, implement a more unified political-military strategy, adapt its organization, and employ effective operational approaches. Even then, earlier military ineptitude had eroded U.S. domestic political confidence to resolve the conflict. After improving its strategy and operational approaches in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013, the U.S. military has reverted to predominantly an attritional strategy and approach.

Our "new normal" is a persistently engaged, forward-based force to prevent and deter conflict and, when needed, act to disrupt and defeat threats. Longterm engagement is a hedge against crisesthat require major intervention, and engagement positions usto better sense the environment and act decisively when necessary. The "new normal," however, translates into increased demand for SOF.The pace of the last ten years is indicative of what we expect for the next ten years.

The aim of Arreguín-Toft's Strategic Interaction Thesis is to provide a theory of asymmetric conflict that explains when and why weak actors are capable of defeating strong actors. Arreguín-Toft first defined direct and indirect strategies for strong actors (direct attack and barbarism) and weak actors (direct defense and guerilla warfare strategy). 866 Arreguín-Toft then proposed that when weak and strong actors engage in same-approach interactions, strong actors are more likely to win, and when they engage in opposite-approach interactions, weak actors are more likely to win (see Figure

Pillai brought attention to this problem in his 2017 article "Reorganizing the Joint Force for a Trans-Regional Threat Environment."

Not only do countries today have to be concerned with what is happening inside their borders, they now also have to manage the security of their citizens from global threats. The NIC points out that "managing global issues will become harder as actors multiply." 908 It is becoming easier for international actors to form organizations, and to scale the size of their organizations. If these organizations do not align with the values of their nation, or nations globally, they can cause problems and lead to instability, particularly in already weak states.
With USSOCOM being the designated lead for countering violent extremists, the SOF community already has the authority to operate across Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC) and has begun its focus on transregional threats, whereas the general purpose forces who still rely on GCCs lag behind.

Colin Gray has pointed out that "SOF prosper when conventional operations are prohibited by political factors, ruled out as too expensive, or otherwise are deemed inappropriate." 913 SOF are encouraged to operate within the political and military domains simultaneously, which has led some to use the phrase 'warrior diplomat' when referring to SOF. Authorized to work as advisor-diplomats and warriors, SOF are able to directly impact the political space as well as the battlespace.

Specialties that differentiate SOF from general purpose forces include conducting counterguerrilla, unconventional and psychological warfare in irregular environments.
Based on the reports of then Brigadier General Edward Lansdale, it was noted that counterguerrilla forces and social reform programs were needed in Vietnam. The idea was to counter NVA/VC using their own tactics against them. Lansdale had experience running this type of campaign in the Philippines and was able to convince the Kennedy administration that "special warfare," in particular, counterinsurgency, unconventional warfare, and psychological operations, was the solution.

Adaptability and flexibility share a close correlation with economy of force. Forces that possess a wider variety of skill sets are force multipliers capable of reducing the need for manpower on the ground. Having a small footprint while providing operational success in the military and political spectrum is ideal for irregular conflicts, where a large footprint can create unnecessary political disruptions and will not necessarily lead to greater success.
If the appetite for military presence is extremely low or nonexistent, SOF can operate as low-visibility intervention force capable of covert and clandestine operations for which general purpose forces are not built.

In SOF's ability to work jointly combined with their authority and capability to conduct a multitude of mission sets is another aspect that separates them from general purpose forces.

The advantage of the SOF's FID mission, including advise, or advise and assist, is a true force multiplier.

In Vietnam, the Army Special Forces displayed their ability to operate across the spectrum of warfare. By the end of 1968, the Special Forces' core missions had become: The above examples of SOF's adaptability and flexibility exemplify the key attribute of SOF that connects them to relational maneuver. Using relational maneuver SOF organizations are able to leverage both the responsive nature of reactive agility and the shaping nature of proactive agility. Responding to unknowns and unknowables in irregular environments will typically be related to violent interactions whereas shaping the environment is a proactive, primarily political endeavor. SOFs advantages collectively allow SOF to understand, adapt, and overcome complex, dynamic, and uncertain irregular warfare operational environments.
Faulty intelligence, poor interagency and interservice cooperation and coordination, provision of inadequate advice to decisionmakers, wishful thinking, and overcontrol of mission execution by officials far removed from the theatre of operations have repeatedly jeopardized the ability of the United States to conduct [Special Operations] missions successfully.

Cohen advocates for the de-politicization of SOF in order to preserve their effectiveness. SOF must also be wary of growing out of control and of increased publicity, as this demoralizes non-elite troops. 
1006
The internal hubris of SOF organizations has also led them to make mistakes of their own. Culturally, the SOF community has a tendency to run toward the sound of gunfire and focus on mission sets that do not drive conflict resolution. While direct action raids do play an important role in beating back enemy organizations, it is political competition that will determine the outcome of the conflict. In order to maintain relevance in future conflicts, the SOF community should shift from a tactical, direct approach, to an indirect approach that focuses on long-term enduring political-military effects. 
1008

Lucien Vandenbroucke points to excessive secrecy and wishful thinking that negatively impact special operations. 
1011
However, what can be certain is the importance of SOF's role in irregular warfare. As noted previously, relational maneuver combined with SOF's advantages allows them to deliver positive results across the entire spectrum of irregular warfare, but the United States must still be careful to employ SOF appropriately and mindful of potential pitfalls in employment.
Both SOF and general purpose forces have advantages and disadvantages that lend toward them playing the lead role in a given conflict. Where to draw the line of roles and responsibilities in a given conflict is an exercise in relational maneuver. maneuver's principles of understanding, identifying, and exploiting the adversary to achieve strategic objectives align with SOF's advantages.
The environment will dictate whether SOF should be the supporting or supported element. The strategy, organizational design, and warfare approaches will follow. Whichever element is in the supported role should chair the chain of command and assign responsibilities as to achieve success throughout the conflict. There are appropriate times for both SOF and conventional leadership to assume command. More often than not, SOF are better-suited leadership in irregular conflicts. The State and Defense Departments should analyze each conflict together to determine who should take the commanding role.
Additionally, leadership should remain for a long enough period to ensure adherence to strategy, creating a reasonable chance of taking effect.
The United States is geared toward fighting large-scale wars and has failed to adequately adapt to the ever-increasing low-intensity warfare.

Adherence to these truths can ensure readiness, capability, and performance when SOF is called upon to act. A stable long-term war strategy, particularly in irregular conflicts, allows SOF to make their most significant impact. 
1023
SOF's inherent advantages enable the conceptual agility to inform, influence, and implement adaptive strategy. Regarding irregular warfare, Tucker and Lamb point out that the U.S. has failed to recognize SOF's role and has "paid repeatedly over the course of its history." 1024 Recognition of SOF as the appropriate choice for irregular warfare should no longer be in question given their inherent relational maneuver advantages.
Recognizing SOF alignment with irregular warfare now enables an internal organizational design analysis of MARSOC. Based on the advantages of SOF in irregular warfare and MARSOC's current design, subsequent chapters will conduct analysis and provide detailed recommendations for how MARSOC can better confront irregular threats.

Significant constraints govern how MARSOC can structure, incentivize, and task its personnel. While constraints represent an input into the system, constraints also interact with the structure, tasks, and people and significantly affect decisions within MARSOC or any U.S. military organization. This section analyzes the most pertinent constraints imposed on MARSOC and differentiates between constraints that can be internally influenced or removed and those that require external assistance to influence or remove.   
The MARSOC Headquarters, the Marine Raider Regiment (MRR), Marine Raider  local warlords, and drug traffickers, presented a complex political and military challenge.
The complexity in number of participants was then exponentially exacerbated by their interactions, which dynamically shifted allegiances' political objectives. The cumulative effect has created highly uncertain irregular environments for MARSOC's operational elements.
MARSOC's internal and external environmental threats to accomplishing its mission in the task environment elevates complexity, instability, and uncertainty. MARSOC's internal U.S. threats pertain to its ability to provide relevance to SOCOM, the USMC, DoD, and U.S. Congress to retain funding. MARSOC faces four significant internal threats. First, within SOCOM, MARSOC will always face competition from other similar SOF organizations to bid for relevant and highly desirable combat-related missions.
Second, like any organization, MARSOC must sustain its manpower to support its missions. One example of this resourcing challenge includes the lack of qualified U.S.
Navy medical personnel to meet the designed organizational requirements for its units. The lack of manpower resources, in this case Navy medical personnel, has threatened MARSOC's ability to deploy units to the task environment. 1055 Third, MARSOC's annual budget considerations represent a reoccurring internal threat that must be managed like any military organization. Fourth and finally, MARSOC faces uncertainty within the rest of the Marine Corps and within SOCOM as to MARSOC's utility to the Marine Corps, SOCOM, and the DoD in comparison to like-units.

Below the component level, commanded by a Colonel, the Marine Raider
Regiment's (MRR) mission states that:
The Marine Raider Regiment consists of a Headquarters Company and three Marine Raider Battalions (1st, 2d and 3d). The Regiment provides tailored military combat-skills training and advisor support for identified foreign forces in order to enhance their tactical capabilities and to prepare the environment as directed by USSOCOM as well as the capability to form the nucleus of a Joint Special Operations Task Force. Marines and Sailors of Marine Raider Regiment train, advise, and assist friendly host nation forces -including naval and maritime military and paramilitary forces -to enable them to support their governments' internal security and stability, to counter subversion and to reduce the risk of violence from internal and external threats. Regiment deployments are coordinated by MARSOC, through USSOCOM, in accordance with engagement priorities for Overseas Contingency Operations. 
1104
Each of the three subordinate Marine Raider Battalions (MRB) use a variation of the following mission: "2d Marine Raider Battalion is organized, trained and equipped to deploy globally for missions as directed by MARSOC. Each Marine Special Operations Company (MSOC) is task-organized with personnel and equipment capable of executing the full spectrum of special operations in support of the geographic combatant commanders."
1105
(
The DoD and SOCOM, and Headquarters Marine Corps, provide relevant guidance and success factors to MARSOC. MARSOC then takes this guidance and produces its own internally developed factors for success.
The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) currently provides the DoD's primary strategic guidance to all U.S. military units. The 2018 NDS explains that the U.S. military faces the primary challenge of competition with "revisionist," "rogue," and violent extremist organizations (VEO) that seek to undermine and attack America's interests, allies, and the current global order. 
1106
These efforts under the threshold of direct armed conflict with the United States often take place within environments such as Syria, Ukraine, Iraq, and Yemen, where local, regional forces are involved in direct and proxy warfare with the U.S. military and its partners.
Therefore, while the 2018 NDS guides the military to refocus on great power competition, it also describes how this competition is taking place within irregular warfare environments. While the NDS does not expressly guide SOCOM to focus on these irregular threats, SOCOM's access, placement, and skills make SOF more ready and relevant to confront U.S. irregular threats than the rest of the military. standpoint, these core activities comprise the skills that MARSOC and the rest of SOCOM currently prepare for, execute, and provide as options for DoD priorities. explained that SOF provides the greatest value in pre-crisis, "left of bang" situations.

To oversee the quality of MARSOC units, MARSOC uses its Training and Education Section G7-led "RAVEN" exercise to assess and evaluate all deploying units. This deployment occurs shortly before each MSOC and MSOT deploys, and the performance results for each deploying unit has been traditionally briefed up to the MARSOC Commanding General, MRR Commander, and other senior leadership. This culmination exercise and assessment is the primary significant driver of MARSOC unitlevel training.
A major cultural measure of success for MARSOC is to retain a distinctive Marine Aside from MARSOC's broad mission statements already listed, specific additional guidance is personality-and mission-dependent and issued by individual commanders, typically upon assumption of command. The personality-based guidance rotates with new command leadership every two years, and mission-specific guidance varies based on individual missions. Essentially, the MRRs and MRBs oversee and prepare MARSOC's primary deploying units at the MSOC and below. Because the MARSOC component traditionally conducts all primary direct coordination with SOCOM to allocate missions, the regiment does not typically influence the deployment process until after the primary decisions are made by the component and when deploying units move into final planning, preparation, and deployment. 
1126
Guidance at the battalion level is similar to the Regimental guidance. Battalion commanders outline individual priorities to staff and subordinate leadership within the constraints emplaced by the component and regiment headquarters. Stylistically, individual guidance differs based on the commander as well as the assigned missions and required skillsets depending on deployment location. Aside from assigning personnel to individual MSOC's or MSOT's, the Battalion level's guidance influences the culture of the battalion but does little to influence deploying units' missions other than rotating MSOCs and managing personnel and logistics support. Overall, the guidance from the Regiment and Battalion vary little and are mostly designed to enable the direction from the component and to support and oversee each unit's deployment.
At the MSOC and below, the guidance varies based on the leadership, the assigned mission, and the analysis and planning for each deployment.
During training, performance is measured by internal MRB, MSOC, and MSOT level training as well as the final G7 RAVEN exercise. On deployment, success depends on the individual mission and chain of command and varies significantly.
Analysis: When comparing MARSOC's mission, strategy, historical context and primary stakeholder's performance measures, four major trends emerge. First, MARSOC is a relatively young organization imposed on the Marine Corps by external political forces. This history remains a significant factor to this day and has created underlying tensions between a Marine Corps cultural identity and a SOCOM or SOF identity. Second, up to now, MARSOC has chosen a broad mission and strategy, which mimics the broader Marine MAGTF strategy, to confront its task environment. This concept is designed to provide the greatest level of organic capability at a low level of command, the MSOC, which is designed to act as a self-contained operational command in deployed environments. Third, MARSOC has avoided specialization and instead advertises that MARSOC can execute nearly any SOCOM mission. Uncertainty, however exists as to what MARSOC's core missions are and what differentiates MARSOC from other SOF units. Fourth, all relevant stakeholders examined, namely the DoD, USMC, SOCOM, and MARSOC, highly value agility, adaptability, and innovation.
Internal Organizational Design: Tasks, Structures, People, and Constraints
At MARSOC's Component level, the Commanding General primarily drives unit tasks through the G3, Operations Division. This staff section's work involves the coordination and selection of specific MARSOC missions in conjunction with SOCOM, oversees the planning for future missions, as well as provides the guidance to the MRR for the planning and execution of assigned missions. The execution of this work is centralized at the Component level. The Component receives feedback from the MRR and uses that feedback, as well as the staff's analysis, to make recommendations to the commander for future missions and guidance. 
1127
1128
the Component provides the assigned missions and guidance to the MRR for execution.
With unique exceptions, the component does not actively deploy personnel or units to the task environment.
Within the Component, the G7 directly oversees the final training certification exercise for all primary units' deployments to the task environment. This control is centralized, and the G7 receives input and feedback from the MRR and subordinate units but retains control and authority for the organization and execution of the exercise. This The MSOC represents MARSOC's primary bid for success in the task environment.
Unlike Army Special Forces and SEAL equivalent levels of command, the MSOC is designed, and enabled in training and deployment, to function as an operational unit with operational command authorities, equivalent to a Battalion Command, over forces in the deployed operational environment. 
1131
1132
In training environments, the MSOC coordinates with its parent MRB and the MRR On deployments, depending on the mission, the MSOC's tasks vary significantly.
In Afghanistan, depending on the year, the MSOC exerted various levels of operational control, though overall the MSOC assumed a predominantly administrative and logistical support role in Afghanistan.

1136
To assess MARSOC's organizational configuration and fit for its mission and environment, this section assesses its departmentation, division of labor, formalization, specialization, and centralization. MARSOC possesses a divisional structure that gravitates toward machine and professional bureaucracy configurations above the MSOC, while the MSOT tends more closely to a simple structure or adhocracy.
(
Previous sections have already outlined MARSOC's operational departmentation.
In military terms, departmentation consists of MARSOC's task organization among the component, MRR, MRB, MSOC, and MSOT. The division of labor pertains to the roles where the component, MRR, and MRB provide oversight, guidance, and supervision to the primary deploying units, the MSOC and MSOT. MARSOC's units above the MSOC are primarily administrative and focused internally to MARSOC's bureaucracy. The MSOC operational missions in the task environment. At the MSOT, specialization still occurs, including medical, communications, weapons, and other skills, but interoperability is even more important due to each MSOT's small size and the necessity for each individual to execute a wide range of skills. Overall, MARSOC is a divisional structure, but each division contains functional elements that require interoperability and coordination to operate effectively, especially in deployed task environments. 
1141
MARSOC seeks to build skills and capabilities to produce a MAGTF-like capability to accomplish any core SOF activity. Although each MRB currently regionally specializes in the Pacific, Middle East, or Africa theater of operations, aside from language training and some differences in battalion internal pre-deployment theater-specific training, MARSOC has chosen to rotate individuals between MRBs and throughout regions with no discernable effort to produce tailored threat or regional expertise. This approach has produced a more general-level experience base but has prevented area or threat specialization across the organization. Although its regionalization model has not changed, MARSOC is currently exploring other deployment models. 1142
(4) Assignment and Rotation MARSOC's structural assignment and rotation policies are based on the Marine Corps' promotion system outlined for officers and enlisted in Marine Corps Orders (MCO) P1400.31C and P1400.32D as well as the Marine Corps official Assignment Policy found 1141 MARSOC's divisional structure is self-evident from its traditional wire diagram by unit designator. Within each unit designator are standard military staff functions. Mission success, especially within deployed operational environments requires close coordination and synchronization across staff sections vertically up and down the chain of command but also horizontally within each unit. At the most tactical unit level, in an MSOT, tactical skills such as Snipers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and Joint Tactical Air Controllers (JTAC) are highly specialized, but many skills require interoperability among team members due to the unit size and types of mission executed. Traditional staff responsibilities are distributed across the team as collateral duties.
1142 Since at least 2013, MARSOC operational units at the MSOT, MSOC, and MRB have experienced high levels of turnover. 1147 Every two years, every officer billet at the MSOC and MSOT experiences a 100% turnover rate, and enlisted personnel turnover at approximately 75%. 
1148
( The Component, MRR, and MRB direct the accomplishment of established administrative and operational requirements that the MSOC must complete to deploy.
These constraints tend to drive the MSOC toward operating in a centralized manner so that it can ensure that it meets all standards to execute the wide range of core activity skills that will be tested at the RAVEN exercise. Especially with the exceptionally high turnover rate of leadership and personnel, this leads to MSOCs spending a significant amount of time to achieve proficiency in basic shoot, move, and communicate skills before training to more SOF-specific skills. Because all MSOCs are expected to achieve basic proficiency at all the same skills across the component, and due to the high personnel turnover, deploying MSOCs focus on generic basic skills and proportionally less training and preparation directly in preparation for their deployed mission.
At the MSOT, the level of centralization depends on its MRB, MSOC, and team leadership as well as the internal experience, cohesion, and competence within the team.
Depending on these interrelated factors, an MSOT will often take Mintzberg's simple structure approach to provide direct supervision to ensure that rules and standards are followed and capabilities produced. If more flexible approaches are encouraged, teams can also gravitate toward the professional bureaucracy model that enables each individual to execute his/her specialized skill-set independently but with less effective teamwork overall. The most successful teams blend direct supervision and professionalization to organically collaborate and creatively adapt and innovate solutions to complex problems in an adhocracy model. This level of collaboration typically requires experienced, mature, and talented MSOT leadership to avoid centralization or disaggregated specialization. The high rate of turnover within MSOTs degrades the level of experience and continuity that contribute to collaborative teams. 
Overall, MARSOC is a divisional structure with mostly machine bureaucracy characteristics. MARSOC gravitates toward a machine bureaucracy structure enabled by centralized procedures and standardization at all levels of command. Each division at the Component, MRR, MRB, and MSOC levels also possesses significant characteristics of a professional bureaucracy. Each staff section specializes according to its section's purpose: administration, intelligence, operations, etc. At the MSOC and especially the MSOT, the level of collaboration increases, with MSOTs blending characteristics between simple structures, professional bureaucracies, or adhocracies.
Structural analysis also reveals potential bureaucratic redundancies between the Component and MRR as well as between the MRB and MSOC. Given its relatively small size, the levels of hierarchy, and associated manpower requirements, appears to have resulted in high turnover within and among units to fill key billets. The overlap in tasks and responsibilities, especially between the Component and MRR indicates that the MRR provides little to the organization in its current structure. Apparent redundancies also exist between the MSOC and MRB level of command. Although designed to be an operational element with full spectrum command and control, the MSOC has largely not operated in this manner, and has been superseded by O-5 and O-6 level commands in both Afghanistan and Iraq as well as the Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) in Africa. Since February 2017, However, MSOCs in the Philippines have conducted a mission and tasks in line with the MSOC's structural design purpose, however, this mission has also contained significant limitations on combat related authorities and permissions. It appears that redundancies in bureaucracy and high turnover has further contributed to producing mechanistic standards and rules to ensure a stable output of deployable, basically trained MSOCs and MSOTs.
MARSOC's structural configuration indicates misfits with its task environment and desired goals. MARSOC desires to be agile, adaptive, and innovative within its task environment. MARSOC currently possesses significant levels of machine and professional bureaucracy characteristics at all levels of command, which inhibits the agility and adaptation required for success in uncertain operational environment. Furthermore, MARSOC possesses a 'tall' vertical structure and hierarchy that also inherently reduces agility. To more effectively confront its uncertain irregular task environments, MARSOC needs to review redundancies in bureaucracy and hierarchy, and interrelated high turnover of personnel, which contributes to centralization, prevents continuity in experience and capabilities and ultimately inhibits agility.
Analysis of the people in MARSOC's organization focuses on "human resource policies of…training and development." 1149 This section discusses these elements in terms of MARSOC's professionalization and rewards system. Overall analysis indicates that MARSOC's structural configuration and high turnover is degrading its professional ability to build and maintain capability as well as apply the principles of relational maneuver.
Furthermore, the Marine Corps rewards system incentivizes an internal bureaucratic orientation across the organization and degrades the employment of relational maneuver.
(1) Professionalism MARSOC's developmental program is tied to a semiformal career track for enlisted and officers. This includes training that is mostly managed by the MRR and below, and professional military education (PME) that is controlled by Headquarters Marine Corps and influenced by the Component. MARSOC heavily depends on Headquarters Marine
Corps to provide formal education to its personnel. For example, unlike other SOF services who send dozens, or hundreds, of officers to receive dedicated SOF and irregular warfare education at NPS each year, MARSOC currently sends 1-2 individuals every two years.
While service PME enables broad education, PME's primary goal is to prepare "future leaders for greater responsibilities," or, in the case of an O-4, to be a staff officer who is prepared to participate in or lead the Joint Planning Process (JPP). 
1150
Course (ITC). ITC is a nine-month qualification pipeline where individuals are trained and certified in basic special operations skills in line with SOCOM's core activities. For officers, ITC has traditionally included a Team Commanders Course (TCC) to prepare special operations officers for their future responsibilities as a Team Commander. In 2013, the TCC prepared officers by holding lectures from guest speakers on negotiations, mediations, public speaking skills; conducted small planning vignettes; and held other decision-making exercises to encourage and evaluate critical thinking and mental agility.
MARSOC also partners with the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) to host special operations courses for MARSOC personnel. MARSOC senior enlisted leadership also attend the Joint Special Operations Forces Senior Enlisted Academy (JSOFSEA) as The extraordinarily high turnover rate among personnel between deployments is a challenge to professionalism within MARSOC. The high turnover rate means that MSOCs and MSOTs must continually train to achieve proficiency in baseline shoot, move, and communicate skills. 
1152
Even though significant professionalism concerns exist, MARSOC pipeline has produced intelligent, mature, and talented Raiders who meet expectations in difficult environments. One particular retired special forces SOTF commander spoke highly of the subordinate MSOTs assigned to his command between 2013 and 2014 stating "your teams
[MSOTs] got it." 1153 He explained that the Marine Raiders under his command understood the operational environment as well as or better than their Army and Navy SOF counterparts and matched that understanding with effective performance. This commander's assessment of MARSOC's performance is reinforced by side-by-side comparisons of Marine Raiders and SOF counterparts deployed around the world. 1154 1152 MSOC and MSOT training cycles are driven predominantly by building team level core activity basic skills and less by the unique requirements of the deployed operational environment. This is a broad generalization, and some units will better tailor their pre-deployment training and preparation for the deployed environment than others. Ultimately, the RAVEN exercise, which assesses basic skills, is mostly not tailored to each unit's future operational environment.

The MARSOC rewards system primarily incentivizes behavior based on internal organizational considerations and not based on the external operational task environment.
Key billets and promotion cycles, especially among officers, drive assignments. 
1155
Experience/trends show that those deemed best and most fully qualified for promotion have successfully served within their PMOS at each rank and have a broad base of MAGTF experience from which to draw from while in more senior ranks. This creates a dilemma for some non-infantry SOOs, or other non-infantry officers desiring to focus a career within the MARSOF network/SOF enterprise. On the one hand it is advantageous to do well in each and every assignment regardless if within your PMOS or not, but on the other, it's generally not advantageous to focus a career within a narrow specialty. MARSOC and PO-SOD are actively advocating HQMC to acknowledge and enforce recurring SOF related tours. When deciding your career track balance these issues to achieve a career that includes both PMOS credibility and broad-based MAGTF experience. 
1156
Carolina than in leading an information warfare campaign within the operational environment and against the threat networks. Overall, the demands of MARSOC's hierarchy of key billets perpetuates high turnover rates within units and billets and reduces overall professionalism, which is further compounded by an incentive structure focused internal to the organization. Individuals are rewarded for occupying key billets, deploying, and gaining a broad range of experience.
The cumulative effect results in gaps in continuity and a short-term perspective that perpetuates individual and organizational interests but does not emphasize effectiveness in the operational environment.
MARSOC, like the larger Marine Corps, is the smallest military service with a corresponding relatively small set of financial and personnel resources. 1158 Therefore, it is especially important for MARSOC to recognize and account for organizational constraints and risks in determining how and where to use its limited resources.
MARSOC's constraints directly influence its internal organizational design and its interaction with the deployed task environment.
(
The primary constraints affecting the component level consists of MARSOC's budget, its Operationally, given its intended purpose, the MSOC does not maximize efficiency or effectiveness within the Marine Corps or SOCOM's administrative or operational constraints. Although MARSOC presents the MSOC as its base unit and bid for success, both in deployed and non-deployed environments, it has not, with the exception of the Philippines since 2017, been provided the authority or permissions to achieve its purpose.
Even within the Philippines, the MSOC's operational authority is restricted and does not extend to combat authorities. 
1169
MARSOC's inputs transform into organizational culture and task-related outputs that interact with the task environment to produce outcomes. This section analyzes both outputs and MARSOC's outcomes compared to the principles of relational maneuver. Conflicts between subcultures begin to occur due to the interaction between established beliefs and ways of thinking driven by separate historical contexts, missions, and organization structures.
Throughout its history, the Marine Corps has developed an internal culture as elite warfighters. 
1172
1173
Our philosophy is Spiritus Invictus -an unconquerable spirit -and through hustle, grit and commitment to professionalism we will accomplish any mission. We are a small organization that does more with less.
MARSOC values people, quality over quantity, and mission accomplishment. We honor our legacy and Marine Corps values. We master the fundamentals, consistently display integrity, and pursue excellence with the utmost professionalism.

Other SOF services' orientation toward reactive versus proactive agility should also inform how MARSOC views and pursues its own organizational agility. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) national mission force units possess the legislative authorities and operational command structure to reactively deploy anywhere in the world more responsively than any other SOF to conduct high-priority direct-action hostage rescue and counterterrorism operations. Some in MARSOC even argue that the force should reorganize under JSOC to realize its potential agility. For more proactive agility, Army Special Forces Group commands are regionally aligned and primarily deploy their forces to their specialized region and combatant command. Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM) has previously been regionally aligned, but its most recent Organizational Strategy, "Force Optimization," gravitates toward reactive agility to quickly respond to any crisis across the globe. 
1189
1193
Overall, MARSOF 2030's objective to equally adapt to any environment, and "orient, focus, or retool capabilities" to "work a discrete transregional problem set" are admirable but will not likely "ensure that MARSOF are the premier forces to meet tomorrow's challenges." 
1195
The complexity of the operational environment and lack of strategic success in irregular warfare should drive MARSOC to achieve a balance between agility relative to general versus specific operational environments. The next chapter will present specific recommendations for how MARSOC can achieve this balance, while the remainder of this chapter assesses MARSOC's organizational throughputs. 1193 Marine Special Operations Command, MARSOF 2030, 17.   1194 Marine Special Operations Command, MARSOF 2030, 17.   1195 Marine Special Operations Command, MARSOF 2030, 34.  (2) Throughputs: Task, Structure, and People MARSOC possesses organizational design inhibitors that consist of misaligned tasks, redundant bureaucracy, and misaligned incentives, which produce high personnel turnover, reduced professionalization, and hierarchical centralization. These inhibitors restrict organizational agility, cognition, and the ability to implement operational approaches that connect partners and combine capabilities to effectively influence the operational environment. MARSOC should address each deficiency to achieve the guiding principles of relational maneuver and MARSOF 2030, and to achieve effective outcomes in irregular operational environments.
Currently, MARSOC's internal tasks focus on building "tactical excellence" but do not adequately prepare deploying MARSOC units to:
thoughtfully combine intelligence, information, and cyber operations to affect opponent decision making, influence diverse audiences, and counter false narratives. Furthermore, we must be able to synchronize operations, activities, and actions in the information environment with those across operational domains and, when necessary, fuse cognitive and lethal effects. 
1196
Corps promotion system and adds an unnecessary set of billets that makes the organization less agile while adding additional bureaucratic requirements. Operationally, the MSOC has also proven to be redundant and its contributions do not justify its tax on personnel and resources. Designed to conduct organic operational command and control for its own MSOTs as well as other SOF teams, with limited exceptions, the MSOC has not received the permissions on deployment to meet this intent. 
1198
Although the MSOC provides capabilities at a level that other SOF units do not, this capability does not effectively fit within its environment. Instead, the MSOC employs the MARSOC's internally focused, machine-like bureaucratic tendencies do not align well with the operational environment. MARSOC's redundant levels of command, centralization, and internal orientation undermine its ability to understand and effectively adapt to its environment. The fact that MARSOC functions as well as it does, given its misfits, is a testament to the leaders and individuals within the organization, but it also suggests perhaps why so many of its most talented leaders become frustrated and choose to leave the organization. 
1199
tasks, like armory maintenance, should operate like a machine. For those units that must interact directly with the task environment, however, this machine needs to morph more into a more structural adhocracy where commanders and leadership collaborate and have the authority to adapt structure, training, and approaches to achieve effectiveness in the deployed environment.
An Open Systems Analysis of MARSOC reveals organizational inhibitors to the employment of relational maneuver in irregular operational environments. MARSOC's broad mission and strategy, hierarchical and centralized organizational structure, and high turnover of personnel inhibit the institutional development of a deep understanding of irregular warfare in general and of specific threat operational environments, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. Furthermore, this gap in understanding irregular warfare is exacerbated by an internally focused organizational culture that does not incentivize understanding the external operational environment.
MARSOC's current level of institutional understanding of irregular operational environments does not effectively enable its units to inform, influence, develop, or implement political-military strategies in irregular operational environments. This gap in determining MARSOC's role in political competition in the operational environment is not unique to MARSOC. As modern strategist Colin Gray explains, the predominant traditional American Way of War is apolitical, which does not align with the requirements of irregular operational environments. 
1200
Redundancies between the component and MSOC reduce efficiency and effectiveness and inhibit organizational agility. MARSOC's endstate for the MSOC, specifically, does not effectively align with either the Marine Corps' administrative constraints or SOCOM's operational constraints. Furthermore, the bureaucratic requirements create incentives for high turnover across the force that decreases professionalization, capabilities, and understanding of the operational environment. The net effect of these internally focused organizational misfits and redundancies reduces MARSOC's relational maneuver effectiveness within the operational environment.
A flawed understanding of the operational environment produces flawed strategy, which, enabled by flawed organizational design, produces flawed operational approaches.
MARSOC's and the U.S. military's bias for action leads to the execution of machine-like attritional approaches, tactics, or activities to use in the operational environment.
MARSOC would be better served by tailoring its organization to adapt to specific strategic threats that will enable MARSOC's limited resources to understand, strategize, and implement effective approaches. In irregular warfare, working with and through indigenous partners as advisors, both militarily and politically, creates operational approaches that achieve strategic outcomes.  interests-the end of destabilizing violence and a strategic ally.

military, including SOF generally and MARSOC specifically, gravitates toward an attritional style of warfare and the employment of relational maneuver in largely a traditional military sense through the use of violence. This gravitational pull is especially evident within the military's conventional forces in Vietnam and Afghanistan. SOF, however, also tend toward attrition in irregular warfare. Experience in Vietnam, El
Salvador, and Afghanistan reveal that SOF generally and MARSOC specifically can and should improve their application of relational maneuver to more effectively wage irregular warfare and produce better politically strategic outcomes against irregular threats.
Chapter VIII is composed of two sections. The first section synthesizes the seven primary areas degrading effectiveness in irregular warfare. These challenges are rooted at the conceptual level and must be addressed to adapt and implement the changes necessary to produce better outcomes. Section B takes these challenges, incorporates the general SOF advantages and MARSOC's organizational design, recommends seven implementable relational maneuver recommendations to overcome the identified challenges. The most important element of this chapter is recognizing the strategic problems and endstate-related challenges that SOF and MARSOC face to enhance efforts contributing to national defense. platform to spur discussion, debate, and ultimately adapt to better overcome the threats facing the United States.
SOF's primary strategic value is not their ability to support conventional forces in major combat operations but their ability to produce strategic effects through the highly discriminate and proportional use of force that avoids politically unacceptable collateral damage or escalation in ways that conventional forces cannot duplicate.

The study of war and warfare reveals the centrality of political competition. Unlike traditional warfare, in irregular warfare, this political competition occurs at all levels of warfare and blends with the use of military violence. 
1222
1220 Mark E. Manyin, et al., Pivot to the Pacific? the Obama Administration's "Rebalancing"  Toward Asia, CRS Report No. R42448 (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, 2012).
1221 Clausewitz, On War, 28. Afghanistan, or with favoring overt cultural niceties such as drinking tea, believing that "sharing their tea, no matter how many cups, will result in a trusting relationship that is sufficient to lead an Afghan to tell any outsider about his son or uncle who meets at night with the Taliban." 1223 These elements, while important, miss the central pillar of war, and its application to irregular warfare: the political competition to impose one nation's will on other groups or nations. The factors influencing this competition can be complex and uncertain across social, religious, economic, ethnic or other dimensions, but these variations all return to the question of who has power and how are they using it.
Proficiency in employing traditional military violence, of course, is foundational to the military profession, whether among conventional forces or among SOF. Therefore, SOF must continue to innovate and train to be the most lethal force on the battlefield. This lethal proficiency, however, is not enough in irregular warfare. Although all war is inherently political, in irregular warfare, political warfare must be the main effort at all levels of war. In irregular socio-political fragmented environments, political competition will take place down to the village level. Within these complex and fragmented contexts, SOF should recognize the centrality of politics and play a critical role in advising and assisting indigenous political-military forces to inform and influence strategy to achieve political goals aligned with U.S. interests.
Although SOF leadership might attest to the centrality of the political problem, this recognition often does not effectively translate down to the operational and tactical levels.
In Afghanistan, SOF theater-strategic, operational, and tactical leadership has often possessed merely superficial understanding of the ethnic-religious-social-political power structures within their area of operations. As a result, the more junior SOF personnel often 1223 Rothstein and Arquilla, Afghan Endgames, 64.  lacked any understanding or appreciation of political warfare. Without this basic understanding, SOF have often underperformed in translating military action to political success. This lack of understanding and appreciation for the centrality of political warfare must change, or the U.S. military and SOF will continue to under-deliver the results necessary for strategic success in irregular warfare. Although the primary U.S. enemies and adversaries have not changed significantly since at least 1979, the U.S. military, largely, does not focus its personnel and units on specific threats, regions, or operational environments. That said, some exceptions do exist.
Army Special Forces Groups are regionally aligned to Geographic Combatant Commands and some Special Forces soldiers remain geographically focused on their region throughout their careers. MARSOC has also followed a similar path by aligning its three operational battalions against three different combatant commands. A closer analysis of MARSOC, however, reveals that its regional orientation is only surface deep. For numerous reasons, MARSOC has chosen to rotate its personnel throughout each battalion, reportedly to instill cross-regional experience and capabilities across the force. While this practice may achieve that purpose, it has also prevented functional regional specialization. Even for individuals and units that have deployed within a geographic region, MARSOC units have intentionally not redeployed individuals and units to the same locations. While this study does not examine internal Army Special Forces rotational practices, informal interaction with Special Forces officers indicates that the same practices occur in that organization.
Therefore, even among SOF, purportedly better attuned to the specific geographic locations and partners, service-and unit-level policies and practices undermine strategic effectiveness.
Furthermore, the U.S. military often prefers to prepare for future traditional warfare with another great power over ongoing irregular warfare operations.  March 7, 2016, 11-12.  importance, but it does mean that the U.S. military and SOF have typically not dedicated enough individuals and units to solve uncertain irregular challenges. The evidence suggests that the military needs to dramatically rebalance its forces to gain a deeper understanding of specific adversaries and strategic geographic partners and locations.
Within the Department of Defense (DoD), SOF are well suited to take the lead in rebalancing toward specialization against specific irregular threats and operational environments. The Army Special Forces (SF) have demonstrated the tremendous impact a force can provide when a crisis or requirement arrives to address a localized threat. In Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan, SF forces either possessed standing relationships with indigenous forces or quickly developed the necessary relationships to influence their partners or context to confront the identified adversaries and wider threats. The regional focus within SF, and more recently within MARSOC, is not enough, however. SOF does not currently adequately prioritize the development of long-standing focused relationships and partnerships to confront well-known threats presented by Russia, China, Iran, Violent Extremist Organizations (VEO), and North Korea. Instead, SOF tend to gravitate toward the missions that emphasize counterterrorism and direct-action-centric tasks, accepting the risk of not emphasizing specific threat or regional expertise. U.S. SOF can and should develop threat-specific cadres with a long-term orientation on these adversaries and their context at a cost-effective price in terms of manpower and general resources.
The history of U.S. irregular warfare indicates that success requires understanding the operational environment. This understanding can only occur through the focused dedication of individuals and units at the expense of broad and general experience. The U.S. military, and SOF, gives too much primacy toward broad experience and short-term focus on the most complex and uncertain problems facing the military.
Failure Even at the generic provincial level, the record is unclear on how effective their efforts were, or whether the State Department merely attempts to construct American-style democracy regardless of its suitability for the local conditions. USAID, on the other hand, has traditionally focused on local development projects, which, although a component of political competition, do not comprehensively address political competition. 1234 Furthermore, in irregular warfare environments, it is generally in U.S. interests to maintain as small a footprint as possible to be able to accomplish the given mission.

Failure 
This study's analysis indicates that organizational design often acts as the limiting factor that prevents successful strategic outcomes in irregular warfare. Organizational design that does not adapt and align to the operational environment prevents identifying and adapting to exploit threat vulnerabilities. Finally, a design that misfits with the environment will find it difficult to assess the effectiveness of its own strategy and Greater effectiveness and better outcomes in irregular warfare also require adapting structural organizational models. In irregular warfare, an effective structural model dedicates specific individuals and units to specific operational environments over time. The U.S. military structural approach to irregular conflicts, however, typically attempts to not interrupt the machine-like administrative model for personnel management and promotion cycles. 
1240
1240 The evidence supporting this assertion is overwhelming across the U.S. military experiences in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Within the Marine Corps in conventional and special operations units, units assigned to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan trained rigorously for the months leading up to deployment, but upon completion of deployment, individuals rotated out of their unit based on their own individual career path, units rarely deployed to the same exact location, and even when they did. The units had often turned over and possessed little continuity. Between 2009 and 2017, it was clear to Major Bailey that this primary priority for the military was maintaining continuity in the personnel management and promotion system. SOF organizations must be ruthless in identifying and reducing redundant structural bureaucracy that decreases organizational agility and the ability to adapt to recognize and exploit threat vulnerabilities. SOF should also identify ways to decentralize authority to the lowest levels in irregular warfare. True decentralization allows delegated authority to make decisions and allocate resources. This decentralization also requires properly professionalizing the people tasked with operating within irregular environments.
Structurally decentralizing authority to advisors in austere environments is crucial to enable agility to produce strategic outcomes. While SOF typically better decentralize authority than conventional forces, SOF should continually search for ways to reduce unnecessary and redundant bureaucracy within the chain of command, which will facilitate greater delegation of authority and enable better communication and unity of effort.
Along with providing the right tasks and adapting the right structures for irregular warfare, success requires professionalizing the SOF leadership and personnel that will operate in irregular environments. Professionalizing SOF for irregular warfare requires education, continuity, and incentives. Educating SOF for irregular warfare requires study and debate on the history of war, strategy, politics, economics, anthropology and religion to prepare them prior to operating in these environments. This education needs to inform the role of these factors broadly in irregular warfare, as well as narrowly in particular threat and operational environments, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere. This education cannot replace the foundational requirement for tactical skills to conduct raids or major combat operations, but should supplement them for better implementation within strategy.
Education enables SOF's individual operators, leaders, and units to match the study of past experiences to their present situation. This match between education and experiences will not likely occur in a single six-month deployment rotation and will develop at different rates for each individual. Continuity in assignments and billets will mesh education and experience as well as allow the development of relationships among military, interagency, coalition, and indigenous partners necessary for success. SOF should provide incentives to individuals and units to pursue the necessary education and continuity to succeed against irregular threats. Analysis indicates that the U.S. military incentivizes a broad focus on conventional military activities, combat experience, and internal organizational billets necessary for promotion. Military services also generally disincentivize temporary advisor structures or billets developed, outside of the normal career path, to confront specific threats. 
1241
Without addressing the tasks, structures, and people within organizational design at an institutional level, any improvements to effectiveness in irregular warfare implemented by capable leadership can disappear when those leaders are no longer in place. For instance, a unit that decentralizes significant authority to SOF individuals who are not properly educated nor given the continuity or incentives to confront a distributed environment will most likely implement similar approaches that were used repeatedly early in Afghanistan and Iraq-direct action capture or kill missions-at the expense of politicalcompetition actions that are more decisive in irregular warfare. Temporary successes produced by individual leaders and units will succumb to the institutional baseline, which is currently detrimental to success in irregular warfare.
Failure to Prioritize Embedded, Advisor-Led Operational Approaches
Operational approaches are the product of the level of understanding of the operational environment, the policy objectives and national interests at stake, and the resources available. Effective operational approaches in irregular warfare depend on understanding the threat, developing and implementing a unified and coherent politicalmilitary strategy, and tailoring organizational design to the threat and operational environment. Appropriate operational approaches are the natural byproduct of aligning the other elements of relational maneuver to specific threats and environments. Alignment requires an iterative and adaptive process of trial and error and demands time and focused attention. Furthermore, successful operational approaches from one environment will require modification before application to a different operational context.
The two primary elements required for U.S. operational success in irregular warfare consist of unified political-military approaches and advisor-centric approaches that span the tactical to theater-strategic levels of war. Because irregular warfare is distinct from traditional warfare primarily due to the centrality of political competition at all levels of warfare, a unified political-military approach is essential.  In war, conceptual understanding does not matter if it is not practically applied.
Section A outlined the seven primary challenges inhibiting the U.S. military and SOF community in employing relational maneuver to recognize threat vulnerabilities, adapt internally, and exploit those vulnerabilities to achieve realistic and desirable political outcomes. Section B translates these challenges directly to MARSOC's organizational design. The purpose of this section is to creatively explore and offer courses of action that MARSOC could implement to overcome the challenges identified in Section A. These recommendations simultaneously address three interactive categories that comprehensively provide a unified strategic direction for MARSOC. First, and most importantly, these recommendations counsel MARSOC to address the U.S. military's vulnerabilities in strategic effectiveness in irregular warfare (See Figure 
42
Third, these recommendations seek to better implement the principles of relational maneuver wherever possible. Relational maneuver is merely an expanded form of   
The single most important decision that MARSOC can make to enhance its organizational effectiveness is to focus its vision and organizational strategy. As of 2018, MARSOC's strategic vision is too broad and vague to establish superior organizational relevance within SOCOM, the Marine Corps, or the Department of Defense (DoD).
MARSOC currently produces a comparable capability to the SEALs and Army Special Forces (SF). MARSOC has yet, however, to realize its potential given the level of talent within its organization. Throughout the DoD, SOCOM, Marine Corps, and internally, MARSOC's strategic utility and organizational strategy is vague and unclear.

The Marine Corps possesses a long and storied history of fighting small irregular wars; however, organizationally, the Marine Corps general purpose forces are designed to provide a Marine Air Grand Task Force (MAGTF) infantry-centric capability that can fight accross the spectrum of conflict. While effective for a wide range of activities, these general-purpose, conventional forces have limited effectiveness in irregular warfare, where light footprints and advisory approaches are often essential. Furthermore, in practice, the Marine Corps does not organizationally value assignments outside of the primary command billets. While general-purpose force Marines may adapt faster in irregular warfare than other services' counterparts, many, if not the majority of, Marines at the tactical level do not gain an appropriate understanding of the nature and character of irregular warfare to achieve effectiveness. By focusing on irregular warfare, MARSOC can provide and retain small, irregular warfare expertise and continuity within the Marine Corps as the rest of the Corps predominantly focuses on traditional warfare activities.
Moreover, MARSOC can provide insight in competing more indirectly against China and Russia.
Lastly, The U.S. military has historically oriented on preparing for fighting major wars through traditional warfare against peer competitors since at least World War II. 
1247
This study recommends that MARSOC focuses its organizational vision and strategy to employ indirect irregular warfare approaches to influence and support national level objectives against prioritized threat networks and within operational environments. By strategically focusing on the desired endstate, this vision enables employment of relational maneuver to decentralize and adapt to leverage resources to meet the commander's intent. Focusing on strategic outcomes still allows MARSOC to retain its ability to accomplish all SOCOM core missions, but it automatically enables prioritization of effort and propels MARSOC toward the ultimate objective of providing capabilities that the nation needs but that the military has not consistently delivered. This focused organizational strategy contains three primary elements: a long-term focus to influence strategic outcomes, oriented against prioritized transregional threat networks in associated operational environments, and through indirect irregular warfare approaches led by embedded advisors. Among the DoD, the Marine Corps, and SOCOM, this approach would be unique and would better align MARSOC to the requirements for employing relational maneuver to influence and achieve strategic outcomes.
To implement an organizational strategy focused on achieving strategic outcomes in irregular warfare, MARSOC should become the Marine Corp's proponent for irregular and proxy warfare and establish its institutional expertise within SOCOM. The realities of the growing power of China and Russia, as well as regional powers like Saudi Arabia and 
To establish MARSOC's irregular warfare expertise within SOCOM and achieve institutional professionalization within the this construct would enable the MARSOC commander, the operational chain of command, and the Marine Raider Training Center (MRTC) to enhance the professional cognitive concepts essential for confronting the complex range of irregular threats through relational maneuver.
A decisive effort for developing the initial cognitive foundation necessary for confronting irregular threats begins at ITC and the Team Commander's Course. These courses already provide an excellent foundation, especially for essential tactical skills, but a review should take place to verify that both ITC and the 
Becoming the Marine Corps' and one of the DoD's leading experts on irregular and proxy warfare will require more than merely knowing doctrine or basic DoD definitions.
This knowledge is important but insufficient for deep study and expert understanding. For example, modern counterinsurgency doctrine outlines a basic 'shape, clear, hold, build, and transition' formula for the U.S. military to apply to an insurgency. 
1249
Application will always require adapting it to the actual threat context. Authoritative doctrine in counterinsurgency may actually provide as much hindrance as help if it is applied generically without taking the actual context into consideration. 
1250
To implement an organizational strategy that desires to influence and achieve strategic outcomes, MARSOC should improve its strategic thinking. MARSOC commanders and leaders in irregular operational environments should think in terms of grand strategy. Grand strategy is typically reserved for the policy or strategic level. In the United States, the National Security Council (NSC) is responsible to the president for recommending and implementing national or grand strategy. Hall Brands defines grand strategy as "the intellectual architecture that gives form and structure to foreign policy." 1251 He further states that grand strategy requires "a clear understanding of the nature of the international political environment, a country's highest goals and interests within that environment, the primary threats to those goals and interests, and the ways that finite resources can be used to deal with competing challenges and opportunities 
The most unique, and arguably the most important, element of this study's proposed strategy is for MARSOC to prioritize and focus on specific threats, partners, and operational environments. From examining relational maneuver and the U.S. military's experiences in irregular warfare, this recommendation should also be the most obvious for success in irregular warfare. Recognizing vulnerabilities, adapting internally, and exploiting those vulnerabilities requires understanding the threat and the operational environment. This understanding cannot occur without prioritization and focused attention from specific personnel and units. MARSOC has an opportunity to lead within SOCOM by adapting itself internally to address DoD-and SOCOM-wide problems to become more strategically effective.
Prioritization requires a decision-making criterion to ensure that MARSOC does not waste its personnel and resources on threats, partners, and operational environments that are not strategically relevant or desired. Furthermore, MARSOC provides the smallest contribution to SOCOM, making its decision-making process all the more important. This   Although there are differences in the order of priority, what is clear from the guidance of DoD, Marine Corps, and SOCOM is that the primary security threats to the U.S. military are clearly defined, at least at the strategic level of warfare (See Figure 
47
Although the world is complex and dynamic, in fact, the nation's primary strategic adversaries have remained consistent, with Russia, China, and North Korea having been America's adversaries since at least 1949. Iran became a strategic adversary in 1979, and global Islamic Jihadists began to mobilize and gain traction during the 1980s across the Middle East. 1258 Therefore, strategically recognizing history and conducting a simple network analysis of these adversaries provides a relatively clear picture of where our primary adversaries are and where they will likely remain for the foreseeable future. This simplicity and stability can enable MARSOC's long-term strategic planning.
To prioritize the list of threats, MARSOC should use an interconnected level of understanding and approach that meshes global, regional, and local threats, partners, and operational environments and choose the threats, partners, and operational environments that best align to MARSOC's organizational culture, strengths, and capabilities. This integrated understanding and approach will allow MARSOC units and personnel to provide strategic utility, not only advising and assisting partners in overcoming local or regional challenges, but also ensuring that these efforts are nested with strategic level interests.
1258 David Rapoport, "The Four Waves of Modern Terrorism," in Audrey Kurth Cronin and James Ludes, eds., Attacking Terrorism, 61-63. MARSOC's current culture, capabilities, and strengths best align with confronting threats in kinetic, expeditionary, austere operational environments. MARSOC possesses a Marine-Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) heritage that integrates capabilities in a combined arms manner across physical and cognitive domains. Particularly, MARSOC possesses the resources and capabilities to integrate intelligence and operations down to its most tactical unit, the MSOT.
1259
While many options exist for MARSOC to apply these decision-making criteria to identify specific threats, partners, and operational environments to strategically influence, this study provides three recommended courses of action to MARSOC. Due to scoping, only the primary recommended option will be described in detail, but the same methodology could be used to apply to the other recommended options. The most important takeaway is not the specific recommended options, but the methodology and the importance for MARSOC to more greatly focus its personnel and units on specific threats, partners, and operational environment to apply relational maneuver and influence strategic success.
When juxtaposed to the array of primary threats, MARSOC's organizational strengths appear most closely suited to confront VEO, Iran, and Russian threat networks since these networks are interconnected to operational environments that play to MARSOC's organizational strengths. Furthermore, these three threat networks are carefully nested within the DoD, Marine Corps, and SOCOM's prioritization of threats. A quick network analysis, depicted in Figure 
48
Ultimately, regardless of the chosen course of action, MARSOC can better contribute to gaps in America's defense and provide direct strategic utility by focusing its organizational strategy on specific threat networks, partners, and operational environments.
At the strategic and operational levels of warfare, the threats and relevant partners are relatively clear and stable. 
1274
The next step in implementing a more effective MARSOC strategy is to better align MARSOC's organizational design to irregular operational environments. This alignment will enable the agility to adapt and implement relational maneuver to exploit threat vulnerabilities. Alignment should occur through adjusting MARSOC's organizational tasks, structures, and people. Improving these three pillars of organizational design will in turn build a more cohesive organizational culture attuned to the requirements to strategically succeed in irregular warfare.
A focused MARSOC vision and strategy allows prioritization of core tasks and activities that will guide education, training, and resource allocation. A focus on irregular threats and irregular warfare places a premium on foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), and unconventional warfare (UW) core activities. Other, more direct core activities, such as direct action (DA) and special reconnaissance (SR), support the essential irregular warfare tasks of supporting or defeating an insurgency through or against proxies. SOCOM's core activities, however, are necessary but not sufficient to effectively focus MARSOC's capabilities to implement and achieve its revised organizational strategy. In addition to specialization in FID and COIN activities, MARSOC should also research and develop core capabilities to politically compete in irregular warfare and to understand counter-proxy warfare efforts by adversaries such as Russia and Iran in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine. 
To achieve enterprise-level agility, MARSOC should address structural challenges inhibiting its ability to adapt to irregular operational environments. By better focusing its organizational strategy and tasks, MARSOC will enhance its relational agility, but this enhancement is insufficient. MARSOC should also reduce redundant bureaucracy, decentralize authority, build continuity, and rigidly institutionalize agility into its structure.
(
To structure to achieve agility, MARSOC should first decide whether to prioritize responsive agility to react to unforeseen military contingencies, or proactive agility to deeply understand the operational environment and adapt to overcome political and violent competitive challenges. RAND's 2013 report on options for the global SOF network generally categorized this agility between responsive direct-action options for counterterrorism, hostage rescue or other "contingencies that may erupt with little or no warning." 1277 On the other end of the agility spectrum, the report provided small footprint advising and capacity building options to proactively shape the environment in support of strategic objectives. 1278 RAND's analysis aligns well to David Tucker and Christopher Lamb's argument that SOF capabilities can be broadly distinguished between direct and indirect approaches, and that in irregular warfare, indirect approaches are more strategically significant than U.S. unilateral direct approaches.

Given its organizational size, MARSOC does not need each level of its current operational structure and could achieve greater organizational agility through combining two levels of its current command. Process of elimination demonstrates that the Marine Special Operations Company (MSOC), in its current form, does not maximize MARSOC's  (4) Continuity in Tasks, Billets, and Units
Professionalism requires time and continuity in tasks, billets, and units. A major problem in the U.S. military's approach to irregular warfare has been the lack of continuity in individuals and units assigned to an operational environment, whether in Vietnam, El

(5)
Reducing redundant bureaucracy, decentralizing authority, and enhancing continuity is not enough to achieve enterprise agility; MARSOC needs to also rigidly structure agility into its organization. Although, as Hy Rothstein explains, "there is no 'one best way' to organize," MARSOC can build-in greater agility to adapt within operational environments. 
1287
57
The output of strategy is the approach implemented. Although irregular warfare and real-world operational environments are too unique, complex and uncertain to provide standardized approaches for success, what is evident from the history of irregular warfare in Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan is that strategic success requires advisors that can understand and balance political and violent operational approaches. To achieve greater strategic effectiveness in irregular warfare, MARSOC should invest more heavily in the role of advisors. This section explores models that MARSOC should consider for more heavily investing in advisor-led approaches as well as existing military programs to facilitate these models.
MARSOC should consider four models for its expanded strategic use of advisors, including Edward Lansdale, John Paul Vann, Lieutenant Colonel Ed Norris, and the use of MSOTs across Iraq and Afghanistan. These models span from the theater-strategic down to the tactical level of war. The consistent thread across all four models is the ability to this study will only further enhance the ability of the Marine Raiders in MSOT to succeed in political-military complexity and uncertainty.
To implement a great emphasis on advisor-led operational approaches, MARSOC With the exception of such positions as SOLOs, SOF deployments rarely extend to one year. SOF personnel identified short deployments with very few mechanisms to ensure continuity of effort as an important challenge to building effective, persistent presence and meeting U.S. strategic objectives. For phase 0 and phase 1 missions in which SOF personnel build on the work that previously deployed personnel have done, lack of detailed knowledge of past operations and future planned operations can undermine the long-term trajectory and ultimate achievement of GCC objectives.

This chapter consolidated seven of the major challenges that SOF faces in producing strategic outcomes in irregular warfare. Section A outlined these challenges broadly relevant to SOF as well as MARSOC. Section B then translated these seven challenges to MARSOC and offered specific recommendations to overcome these challenges. The paths to adapt and overcome these challenges all derive from the principles of relational maneuver, applying them to irregular threats and warfare. MARSOC reflects many of the challenges that confront SOF and the U.S. military writ large. The U.S. military shows a gap in producing strategically successful outcomes against threats in irregular 1307 Source: Eaton et al., Supporting Persistent and Networked Special Operations Forces (SOF)  Operations, 4.  warfare. At the heart of this gap lies deficiencies in understanding both the threat and the larger social-political context by too narrowly focusing on violence rather than politically centered strategic thinking, and a failure to properly wage political and violent competition at all levels of warfare. The unbalanced military tendencies toward internal administrative bureaucratic constraints drive short billet assignments, short deployment rotations, and degrade focused long-term attention on known strategic threats to U.S. interests.
The guiding principles in MARSOF 2030 closely mirror the principles of relational maneuver applied to irregular warfare. To effectively pursue MARSOF 2030's four guiding concepts, MARSOC should focus its organizational strategy. Each of the four pathways, "Cognitive Raider," "Enterprise Agility", "MARSOF as a Connector," and "Combined Arms for the Connected Arena," represent effective pathways to apply to MARSOC; however, left unfocused, these pathways will not be effectively realized and will leave MARSOC without a sense of organizational purpose, which will impede its ability to provide superior strategic utility to the DoD, Marine Corps, or SOCOM. MARSOC needs an achievable strategy and commander's intent with a clearly defined purpose and endstate.
If that endstate is left vague or undefined, as it currently is, MARSOC will not achieve its potential.
This study concludes that MARSOC is well suited to provide strategic utility to this nation's defense by better balancing the military's short-term tactical focus with a longerterm strategic perspective oriented toward specific transregional threats. Taking into account its organizational culture and design, as depicted in Figure

Manoeuvre, by contrast, is not a familiar practice in recent American military operational form. In fact, in the language of the US Army, manoeuvre is frequently confused with mere movement, or at least offensive movement. Manoeuvre may well call for movement but it is very much more than that. It can be applied not only in ground combat but in all warfare, and indeed in all things military, even research and development. Manoeuvre describes 'relational' action -that is, action guided by a close study of the enemy and of his way of doing things -where the purpose is to muster some localized or specialized strength against the identified points of weakness of an enemy that may have superiority overall.

Ultimately, the U.S. military has been largely unable to inform and influence strategy or implement operational approaches that exploit threat vulnerabilities to achieve strategic success. In irregular warfare, operational and strategic success derives from the use of relational maneuver and from the understanding that irregular warfare is best considered as "armed politics" (See Figure 
61
1310
Beyond tailoring recommendations to MARSOC through case-study insights, this study produced three specific insights not previously considered when research began.
First, research re-discovered the centrality of politics in irregular warfare and reconsidered how to frame political competition and its decisive role in irregular warfare. This study arrived at the conclusion that all warfare is political, and that calling irregular warfare political warfare in the George Kennan sense is accurate, but also potentially 1311 Marine Special Operations Command, MARSOF 2030.  misleading. 
1312
The U.S. military, and particularly SOF, are often the only representatives from the United States with access to some of the remote and violent areas embroiled in irregular warfare. Regardless of whether another agency in the U.S. government should be conducting political competition with and through indigenous partners in these areas, the U.S. military is often the only available option to lead and conduct this effort. Furthermore, it is irrational to expect that policy-makers in Washington, DC, or even diplomats in a partner's national or provincial capital, would understand the feasibility or application of strategy throughout a diverse country like Afghanistan. This reality makes political competition in irregular warfare a U.S. military problem in all phases of an operation. This study's analysis of the U.S. military's overall efforts in Vietnam, El Salvador, and Afghanistan strongly supports the assertion that the U.S. military has poorly understood political competition's decisiveness in irregular warfare and has struggled to translate its level of understanding into application and strategic success.
Since strategic success directly depends on the alignment and balance of violence and politics to strategic objectives, this study recommends that MARSOC more fully invest in understanding and waging political competition within the bounds of its legal authorities. thought of as the "making or breaking of coalitions" to influence a certain "distribution of power."
1313
Second, and based on the centrality of political competition in irregular warfare, this study identified the strategic nature of the challenge in irregular warfare. A primary thread presented in the study of the U.S. military experience in irregular warfare has been the problem of strategically aligning military violence to solve political problems. This study re-identified that strategic thinking needs to pervade all levels of command, especially in irregular warfare. 
1314
The most tactical-level leaders in irregular warfare must think in strategic terms to understand the complex array of U.S., coalition, local partner, and adversarial strategic interests. Military leadership, including within MARSOC, is underprepared for this level of strategic thinking. This strategic thinking, in fact, is closer to national, or grand, strategic thinking than it is to military strategy in traditional warfare, which primarily considers the use of military violence to achieve an objective. This study concludes that MARSOC needs to better develop strategic cognition and capabilities, especially at the most tactical levels of command.
Third, and finally, this study rediscovered the extent to which flawed organizational design can constrain a military from employing relational maneuver in irregular warfare.
Misaligning tasks to the operational environment undermines the military's ability to succeed in irregular warfare. Furthermore, organizational structure, which includes individual and unit rotations and assignments, has significantly inhibited strategic effectiveness in irregular warfare and could continue to do so. If there is misalignment to the operational environment, individuals and units do not have the continuity of understanding or unity of effort to overcome complex and uncertain irregular warfare expertise within irregular warfare and small wars provides that direct utility. The Marine Corps is largely reorienting on traditional warfare and expeditionary core competencies outside of the scope of irregular warfare. The Marine Corps still recognizes the importance and probability for future operations in irregular warfare. MARSOC can provide that residual expertise and maintain core advisor skills, practices, and lessons learned from its study and continued application around the world. 
The 2018 NDS outlines a picture of the current and future operational environment.
It is an environment where the U.S. military faces growing conventional military strength from peer and regional competitors; however, it is also an environment where peer, regional, and extremists' networks are employing proxy and irregular warfare to undermine U.S. interests. Current indications reveal that this trend of irregular warfare will likely increase in the future. The U.S. military's and SOF's efforts reveal substantial challenges in understanding irregular warfare and adapting to overcome those challenges. The secrets to success in these environments are not secrets at all. These have been extensively studied, yet their lessons lay largely unimplemented. Relational maneuver provides the style of warfare and philosophy requisite for success. This style of warfare ultimately sacrifices internal efficiency for the external understanding necessary to identify and exploit threat vulnerabilities to defeat the enemy system. In irregular warfare, this enemy system is often indistinguishable from the larger operational environment.
Relational Maneuver is basically an expanded version of the Marine Corps'
Maneuver Warfare applied more directly to the realities of irregular warfare. Maneuver Warfare depends on unity of vision through a clear commander's intent to enable decentralized adaptation and implement the best approaches to achieve the commander's purpose and endstate. MARSOC does not currently possess a strategy and clear commander's intent to apply the foundational tenets of relational maneuver. In all war, but especially applicable in irregular warfare, Clausewitz reminds us of the enduring truth that "the political object is the goal, war is the means of reaching it, and the means can never be considered in isolation from their purposes." 
1316
Ultimately, as the primary intended audience, this study suggests that MARSOC should more effectively employ relational maneuver to guide its organizational strategy to influence and achieve strategic outcomes. To do so, MARSOC needs to use relational maneuver to more externally orient on the known threats facing the U.S. to develop a deep understanding of strategic threats, partners and social-political operational environments. MARSOC must also understand that irregular warfare is armed politics, and strategy must reflect that political competition is the main effort. MARSOC should also adjust its organizational design to enable continuity, proactive agility, and decentralization on its prioritized threats partners and environments. Finally, MARSOC should give higher priority to SOF's primary strategic utility in irregular warfare through advisor-led operational approaches to influence and achieve strategic outcomes.

Afghanistan between 2001-2018, relevant political actors and networks spanned individual villages, tribes, subtribes, clans, ethnicities, religions, political affiliations, and state governments. The sheer number of political actors and their dynamic interaction create complexity and challenges that impede understanding and identifying proper objectives and solutions. (2) Irregular Methods Joint doctrine explains that irregular warfare includes "non-traditional methods such as guerrilla warfare, terrorism, sabotage, subversion, criminal activities, and insurgency for control of relevant populations." 134 This irregularity in methods is related to disparities in material strength between the irregular forces, such as terrorist or insurgent groups, and state governments, which normally possess regulated militaries and police forces. 135 Terrorists and insurgents often employ irregular tactics because they do not have the human and material strength to operate in a traditional manner; or, in the case of a proxy warfare effort such as the U.S. unconventional warfare support to the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, a nation state may use irregular methods to weaken an adversarial 134 Department of Defense, Irregular Warfare, 14. 135 Luttwak, Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace, 153. state 137 Moreover, military historians Williamson Murray and Peter Mansoor reveal in Hybrid Warfare the prevalence of mixing traditional and irregular forms of warfare throughout history. 138 The history of irregular warfare also reveals, however, what happens when irregular forces improperly employ traditional forms of warfare against a materially stronger government force. Robert Taber's history of insurgency and guerrilla warfare, War of the Flea, describes how communist insurgents in Greece in the late 1940s fatally decided to employ traditional forms of warfare by holding and seizing terrain rather than employing previously successful forms of guerrilla warfare. 139 Exposed to the materially stronger government forces, the communist insurgency was quickly crushed by the government through traditional attritional firepower and maneuver. Similarly, in 1968 the communist Viet Cong (VC) insurgency in South Vietnam massed forces during the Tet offensive to seize and hold key terrain across South Vietnam. As in Greece, the South Vietnamese and U.S. military crushed the VC uprising and virtually destroyed the active guerrilla forces across South Vietnam. 140 Unlike Greece, however, the military defeat of the VC also 136 Steve Coll, Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to
generally more indirect and uncertain than traditional warfare threats. The interrelation between the level of threat to U.S. interests, its associated impact on national willpower, and connected uncertainty imply that the United States, and its military, should pursue objectives while not overspending beyond the level of national interests and commensurate willpower. (4) Uncertain Operational Environments Political complexity and instability, irregular methods, and indirectness of the threat to U.S. interests create highly uncertain irregular operational environments. Because of the number of political actors and their dynamic interaction between state and non-state groups, the political objectives and factors influencing the political decision making are uncertain. Within Afghanistan's operational environment between 2002 and 2018, the threat network has included a wide range of interconnected groups. These groups have included hardline al Qaeda enemies, a range of Taliban-led and affiliated adversaries, proxies from Pakistan and Iran who have acted as opportunists, belligerents, or outright adversaries, local warlord and criminal opportunists, and the local neutral population that 146 Andrew Mack, "Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars: The Politics of Asymmetric Conflict," World Politics 27, no. 02 (January 1975), https://doi.org/10.2307/2009880. 147 Mack, "Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars," 181-186.
149 Figure 6. Political and Violent Competition at All Levels of Irregular Warfare 150 152 By the nature of an irregular threat's complex local, regional, global socialpolitical context, military violence will often not decisively achieve the ultimate political objective. Instead, as depicted in Figure 7, irregular warfare requires meshing violent and political competition at all levels of warfare. 152 Christopher Paul et al., Paths to Victory: Detailed Insurgency Case Studies (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013). 153 Simpson, War from the Ground Up.

Van Horn explores potential solutions for "counterinsurgents to indirectly topple the insurgency by destabilizing the relationships between the principal and its agents." 958 Van Horn's case study analysis of the CIA-supported Tibetan insurgency from 1956-1974   revealed that supporting the Tibetan insurgency was a cost-effective way to sufficiently inflict damage to and create a significant distraction for the Chinese military.

The MRR is the first deployable unit in MARSOC's chain of command and provides oversight and guidance to the MRBs either directly or through the Regimental Operations Section, the S3. The MRR conducted its first operational deployment in 2016 to lead Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Iraq (CJSOTF-I) within Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). Outside of deploying as a CJSOTF, the primary tasks for the MRR includes the oversight of the primary deployable elements from the MRBs.
(
The battalions directly oversee MARSOC's primary deploying elements, the In the deployed task environment, the battalion's role depends on the assigned mission, the personality of the command leadership, and the higher chain of command.
Generally, in Afghanistan and more recently in Iraq, the MRB headquarters appeared to predominantly focus internally on the management of subordinate units and the coordination with higher headquarters and adjacent U.S. and coalition forces. What the MSOC has successfully demonstrated is that pushing typical SOTF level support capabilities down to the team level has produced an advantage for MSOTs within their complex task environments. This advantage should be maintained and enhanced.
While other SOF units employ an O-4 level command largely in an administrative, support, and mentorship role, MARSOC should examine whether this level of command maximizes its advantages and whether it should exist at all. The future structural recommendations will outline an alternative to gain efficiencies internal to MARSOC and maximize its advantages to gain operational effectiveness.

As much of the DoD orients directly on competition among the great powers, MARSOC could provide strategic utility by prioritizing its attention and resources on the Iran and the jihadist VEO networks across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Although the United States appears to desire to marginalize these less strategically important regions in favor of direct great power conflict, the irregular conflict zones in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere show little signs of ending. These irregular operational environments will also likely continue to provide venues for proxy conflict both for regional powers, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, as well as among Russia, (2) Unconcentional Warfare
As the original design function for the Army Special Forces, this study recommends that MARSOC not try to duplicate or replace but, rather, complement Special Forces UW efforts in developing and working with guerillas, auxiliaries, and underground networks.
Since both FID and UW represent opposite perspectives on the same basic probleminsurgency-MARSOC should develop and maintain the skills sets and understanding to lead a UW effort, but will likely play a supporting role in these operations to Special Forces.
More appropriately, MARSOC should seek to take the lead in studying and implementing UW operational approaches in larger FID operational environments.  In each case, whether conducting FID, UW, or supporting major combat operations, MARSOC should seek to employ as little personnel and units as possible to accomplish its mission. Small footprints are a hallmark of special operations within irregular warfare, and MARSOC's small size should incentivize small footprints and embedded advisory approaches to do more with less. MARSOC's small size and limited resources calls for tasks, structures and people that can do more with less to achieve greater organizational agility and strategic outcomes. Like other models, the MSOT proved itself in Afghanistan and Iraq as an effective and adaptive model that facilitates advising across the range of train, advise, assist, and accompany (TAAA) missions in irregular warfare environments. The adaptability of this model is further demonstrated by the fact that MSOTs often subdivide into two or more smaller elements often for entire deployments to adapt to the challenges faced. This agility, and the effectiveness it facilitates, demonstrates that the MSOT should be retained for its versatility for both responsive and proactive agility. The professionalization advocated in challenges. Across each case study, the military, including SOF, rotated individuals and units through the conflict in a manner that made sense bureaucratically but not strategically.
This lack of structural continuity must be corrected to produce more effective outcomes in irregular warfare.
The size and scope of this research study were the most significant challenges, resulting in its most significant weakness. Since this study seeks to produce timely, relevant, and implementable recommendations to MARSOC, it synthesized and addressed a wide range of the topics deemed most relevant. This breadth of analysis enabled exploring a preponderance of the issues necessary to produce the recommendations, but the large scope also limited the depth of specific analysis in each subject. While confident of the synthesized analysis and recommendations, the scope of this study creates opportunities to debate specific interpretations within each case study and in the internal organizational design analysis of MARSOC. The challenge of scope and size, however, also offers an opportunity for MARSOC, the Marine Corps, and other SOF units to use this analysis and the frameworks as jumping-off points achieve greater strategic effectiveness.
The size and scope of this study provide many further research opportunities.  necessity for this approach is explained, scope did not allow for a full investigation on all the relevant factors surrounding its implementation.
