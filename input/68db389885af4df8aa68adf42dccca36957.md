As these events had been transpiring, Brigadier General William Tunner, the Deputy Commander of MATS for Air Transport, soon recommended to his commander, Major General Lawrence Kuter, that MATS take charge of the airlift operation.
He felt that the operation could stand improvement, as none of the airmen in the European theater had any prior airlift experience.
Moreover, he realized that the capabilities of airlift were largely unknown throughout the military and the men running the operation were combat, "The Tusa's reflect that "Americans ... had to weigh the needs of Berlin and the city's political and strategic importance against their commitment to supply bases in the rest of the world and the danger that the Russians might strike somewhere other than Germany.
Putting everything they had into the Berlin effort could well cause even worse problems."
