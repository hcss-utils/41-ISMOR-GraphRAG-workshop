After the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941 and unnecessarily declared war on the United States in December of that year, the struggle for the Germans became multifaceted and less focused on Britain.
For the British, Germany always remained the main focus.
It would only be with the massive and effective attacks of the Allied Bomber Command during the Battle of the Ruhr valley in spring 1943 that refocused German attention on the threat that Britain represented.
In the end, it would be the critical period between June 1940 and June 1941 where the competition between Britain and Germany would determine the war's eventual outcome.
