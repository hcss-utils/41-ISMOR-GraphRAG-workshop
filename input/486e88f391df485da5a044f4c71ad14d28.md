According to Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, "the U.S. military is at a crossroads" as the rebalancing in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review envisages a severe constriction in conventional ground forces, including a planned 20 percent reduction in the active component of the U.S. Army.
1 Meanwhile, however, competitors have continued to focus on direct military competition with adversary states.
It follows that the strategic relevance of Landpower overall is not an assessment that the United States can make for itself, in isolation from the strategic environment as perceived by competitor nations with a distinctive land force posture of their own.
Russia is the prime example.
Operations in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in early-2014 demonstrated the results of processes that had been ongoing in the Russian military and in Russian security thinking for almost a decade, 2 as Moscow continues to place primary importance on conventional military force, with the direct intention of growing capability in order to challenge U.S. power.
