The second phase of Russian Air Force involvement in Chechnya began, when Russian ground forces advanced toward Grozny on 11 December 1994.
The supporting infantry, poorly trained and led, was unable to keep up with the Russian armor.
The tanks advanced more rapidly than the infantry and, unprotected, became easy targets for the Chechen guerrillas fighting from well-concealed positions in the urban fortress.
Major General Yevgeny Nikitenko, the deputy head of the General Staff's Military Science Directorate admitted that planners had "miscalculated" the scale and intensity of the rebel resistance.
He further implied that if given another chance, Russian troops would enter Grozny only after "massive bombardment" by Su-24s and Su-25s to "destroy the mini-army that Dadayev had set up."
21 This lesson figured heavily in Russian plans for the Second Chechen War.
However, the slaughter did not result entirely from disorganized troops and bad tactics.
Severe weather and a general lack of coordination between air and ground units significantly hampered close air support during this phase.
