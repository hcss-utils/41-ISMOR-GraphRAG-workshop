The second part of this paper will address how the major powers themselves use international law in strategy.
The concept of lawfare also applies to some of these state actions, but strong states practice lawfare differently than weaker powers.
Lawfare for major states is used to support the legitimacy of military action because international law is one of the keys to the politics of justifying force.
States also use lawfare as part of a more complex campaign to exploit the gap between war and peace by using measures short of war, to include the introduction of non-state military forces-including proxies, contractors, and Private Military Companies (PMC)-onto the battlefield.
Examples of major states using lawfare include Russia's manipulation of international law to justify its actions in Ukraine, the growing use of PMCs and mercenaries in war, and the incorporation of lawfare into strategic planning such as the West's counterinsurgency doctrine and modern Chinese strategic theory.
