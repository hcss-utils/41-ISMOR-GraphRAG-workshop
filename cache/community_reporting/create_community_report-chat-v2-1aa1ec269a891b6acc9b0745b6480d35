He argued that wars were not inevitable after the advent of nuclear weapons, believing that coexistence represented a continuation of the struggle between two social systems but through peaceful means.  \n\nThis view on war as avoidable was maintained by Khrushchev himself and was also reflected in the Soviet Military Encyclopedia. Despite advocating for peace, Khrushchev recognized the importance of military strength, stating that nuclear weapons were the primary armament of the Soviet armed forces. He is considered a key figure in discussions about both armed struggle and the transition to socialism.
