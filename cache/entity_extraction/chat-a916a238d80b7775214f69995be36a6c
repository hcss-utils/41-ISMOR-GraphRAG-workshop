Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Today, Americans still fear this threat in their everyday lives. In a recent poll, voters from both the Democratic and Republican parties still place heavy emphasis on their prospective candidates' policies toward combating Jihadist terrorism. \n44\n45\nThe current Jihadist threat against the American homeland does not consist of one sole enemy, it is rather a blend of both foreign terrorist organizations (FTO) such Al-Qaeda or ISIS, and homegrown Jihadists. As Al-Qaeda and ISIS can target the American homeland, many of the recent attacks have actually come from American citizens who act as lone-wolf actors. This reality not only stresses the current intelligence structure, but also blurs the once conventional expectation of a Jihadist being an operative who enters the United States from overseas, like those on 9/11. Today, the American homeland must be ready for both of these Jihadist threats.\n44 John Mueller and Mark G.
