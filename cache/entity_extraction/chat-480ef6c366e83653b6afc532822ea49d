This thesis discusses these threats and analyzes the current DHS, FBI, and SLTT law enforcement postures toward them. The research conducted for this thesis suggests that the current domestic intelligence agencies are not able to address this new confluence of threats sufficiently. Although no single, new domestic intelligence agency is needed, significant reform is necessary.\nAs the United States adjusts to the changing international security environment, the threats to its security at home and abroad will continue to build. Since 9/11, Jihadist terrorism has been the focal point of defensive effort within the American homeland.\nThese dangers stemmed initially from Al-Qaeda due to their involvement in the 9/11 attacks. However, the Jihadist threat now includes both the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and lone-wolf actors who have undertaken recent acts of terrorism such as the San Bernardino and Pulse Nightclub massacres. \n1\n3\n5\n7\nWhile foreign terrorist organizations (FTO) like Al-Qaeda and ISIS could still attack the homeland, American lone-wolf Jihadist and Alt-Right terrorist attacks have been extremely successful in recent years. Furthermore, great power incursion is a reality that could hurt America's standing in the overall fight of GPC if it is not dealt with effectively. Essentially, these three threats could simultaneously target the American homeland at any one time, and DHS, FBI, and SLTT resources may not be enough to effectively combat them. Under these circumstances, this thesis answers the following research\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
