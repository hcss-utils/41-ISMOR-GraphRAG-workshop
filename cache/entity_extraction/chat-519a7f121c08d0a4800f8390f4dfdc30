If the enemy has no means to counter the electronic warfare assets that prevent him from executing key fire support tasks, he is defeated asymmetrically. His cannons and rockets are rendered irrelevant by a system for which, due to its dissimilarity, he has no counter.\nTechnology may be key in gaining an asymmetric advantage through exploiting new vistas in military capability, however, it may also enhance the traditional American preference for asymmetry through overmatch.\nThe new doctrine describes an overmatching relationship as generating and applying power similar to that of the enemy's at a level and in a manner it cannot match. This relatively simple idea has two dimensions. First, it may be a raw quantitative imbalance such as applying a division artillery's worth of firepower against an enemy battery in a counter-battery duel. Second, in a more sophisticated approach, overmatch may achieved by disparity in the capability and agility of friendly and enemy forces. Forces can overwhelm an enemy by applying extraordinary levels of force at a tempo the enemy cannot resist. The significant feature is effect rather than quantity. By leveraging communication and information technology, a commander may achieve the equivalent effect of a division artillery's worth of firepower by combining operating systems, core functions, and tempos. An overmatching advantage can be achieved by striking the right blows, against the right targets, in the right combination, in the right sequence. \n79\nA force projection Army.
