It seems like you have a text document and a list of entity passive observers to active participants in a mission, showing a dynamic change in their role.\n\nFrom what I understand, you want me to:\n\n1. Identify entities (person, role, technology, organization, event, location, concept) mentioned in the text.\n2. Extract relationships between these entities, such as \"The team receives communications from Washington\" or \"Sam Rivera is directly involved in the process of learning to communicate with the unknown intelligence.\"\n3.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
