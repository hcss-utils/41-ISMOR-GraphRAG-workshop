Furthermore, as the operation progresses the proportions of activity, or \"shifting combinations,\" associated with each category will change (see Appendix D, Shifting Combinations). An appreciation of proportion of activity associated with each category provides insight to the operational emphasis. Moreover, it is a useful concept in planning and executing the operation within the context of the greater doctrinal architecture. The new doctrine uses two very short examples to illustrate the concept of shifting combinations across the spectrum of operations:\nOperation DESERT STORM in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991 was offensive in the main with complementary defensive, stability, and support operations. Operation POWER PACK in the Dominican Republic in 1965 was stability in the main with complementary offensive, defensive, and support operations. \n47\nAFDD-1 uses a single overarching framework to describe the Air Force's concept of aerospace power. Within this framework, several component structures add definition and organization to a broad perception of aerospace power's multiform nature. It makes a translation of current aerospace capabilities into Air Force basic missions. The results of this evolution are broad functional requirements for modern aerospace operations that correspond to current capabilities within the Air Force force structure. More importantly, the new doctrine connects these aerospace capabilities to contemporary national security requirements.
