Long lasting relations and alliances, such as that between the northern and southern Ui Neill, did develop but within these regional unions existed a constant jockeying for position. Onto this turbulent scene arrived the Dal Cassian king, Brian B\u00f6rumha.\nAt first, the new king faced almost insurmountable challenges. Unfriendly kingdoms surrounded the Dal Cais: Connacht to the North; the Eoganachta, traditional kings of Munster, to the East; a hostile king Maelmuadh to the South; and the Vikings of Limerick squarely in the middle of his territory. In addition, the Shannon River provided ready access to any fleet bent on raiding along the river's banks. The Dal Cais had little wealth and even less political clout with which to establish or maintain authority. As a small 138 D.A.
