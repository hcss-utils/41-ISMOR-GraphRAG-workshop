We must also face the pressures that move the military away from innovation. The DOD system rewards laboratories with additional funding (contracts) when they dedicate themselves to maintenance and upgrades for existing systems. The laboratories receive no such incentive for striving towards visions of the far future. It is not surprising that the labs place their focus on the short term.\nWe require a defined customer for far future technologies. The ideal internal customer for revolutionary innovation would be the Joint Chiefs. But there are inadequate connections between the Joint Chiefs and service laboratories. Consequently, broadly sweeping strategies that capitalize on novel technologies are not rapidly incorporated into our organizations, doctrine, or systems. Combat developers can be second innovative customers for research and development. At present the services only influence product development in the latter stages of the R&D cycle. Industry experience, however, has shown that if the customer and designers share in all product development decisions from the initial design, the degree of innovation is much higher, the product acceptance rate is much greater, and the pace of technological change is much faster. We should profit from these lessons and from bringing users and combat developers into the R&D process earlier.\nIndustry can also be a better innovative customer for military research and development. There are naturally constituent pressures applied by the industrial half of the military-industrial complex which are usually focused on legacy systems. Because no risk is involved in continued production of established systems, firms are virtually guaranteed profits. Designing a truly innovative system risks substantial loss if the concept does not work or\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
