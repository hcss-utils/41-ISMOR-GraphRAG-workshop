Further definition comes from the distinctions in the two categories the doctrine makes for operating systems: engagement systems and integrating systems.\nThe reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence (RSI) system is used to see the enemy, terrain, and other aspects of battlespace that will affect friendly operations. It employs technical assets, human sources, and force to discover and test the enemy's organization, disposition, strength, and intent. Technical assets rely primarily on signals intelligence, photography, seismic and sensor acquired data, and radar. Human resources rely mainly on reports submitted by patrols, special operations forces, and long range surveillance detachments. Force seeks to compel the enemy to react to direct attacks (reconnaissance in force), fire strikes (reconnaissance by fire), feints and demonstrations. A critical part of the RSI system is understanding how the enemy employs its RSI, and learning to counter it.\nInformation Dominance systems magnify our combat power and diminish the enemy's. A key information dominance function is confusing, disrupting, or paralyzing the enemy's ability to apply his engagement systems. The information dominance system may be employed in a passive or active manner. Typical actions include jamming, signal. Information dominance systems are normally used to complement other non-lethal and lethal assets.\nThe maneuver system is made up of those forces that employ fire and movement to close\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
