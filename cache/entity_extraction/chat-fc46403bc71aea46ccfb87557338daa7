The key features in this structure are the distinctions between the categories of operations, the internal structure that defines them, and their role in describing the Army's operational concept.\nThe distinctions between the categories of operations are based on the use of military power.\nOffensive operations carry the fight to the enemy. They are the decisive form of warfare, the ultimate means of imposing the commander's will on the enemy. Defensive operations are those undertaken to cause an enemy attack to fail. Alone, they achieve no decision and must be combined with, or followed by, offensive action. Stability operations apply military power to influence the political environment, facilitate diplomacy, and disrupt specified illegal activities. They include both developmental and coercive actions.\nSupport operations provide essential supplies and services to assist designated groups. They are conducted mainly to relieve suffering and assist civil authorities responding to crises without an active adversary. \n35\nFM 100-5 defines and describes each category of operation through a common set of internal structures. This organization of thought provides discipline in promulgating an explanation of, and guidance for the conduct of, real world operations. The new doctrine's individual discussion of offensive, defensive, stability, and support operations share (as applicable), these elements: a description of the operation's execution imperatives, an explanation of how to plan and execute the operation in the context of a comprehensive conceptual framework, a description of the specific subcategories of the operations, a definition of the various forms of offensive maneuver,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
