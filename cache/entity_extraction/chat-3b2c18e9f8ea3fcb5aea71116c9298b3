Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Since its appearance, however, the Joint Staff has yet to develop such a process.\nJV 2010 will ultimately be evaluated by how well it supports national objectives. To meet future challenges, our strategic means must be far more agile. We will increasingly require flexible people and adaptive organizations to function in fluid environments. Our national security strategy calls for proactively shaping the international environment, emphasizing relationships with friends, allies, and coalition partners. JV 2010, on the other hand, has a warfighting focus with stress on the upper end of the conflict spectrum. Implementing it literally would structure our forces purely for warfighting rather than engagement, presence, or crisis response. The Chairman and CINCs will not let this happen, but the dilemma must be resolved.\nA joint vision should guide the Armed Forces from rigid or single service solutions toward an evolving, comprehensive framework to deal with any and all challenges. Operating in such an atmosphere requires flexible, adaptive forces that can reorganize and reorient rapidly in response to new tasks and missions. JV 2010 must promote adaptation and innovation. It must generate both doctrine and forces to proactively shape the security environment of the next century. Rather than channeling it must advance innovation on a wide front. We live in a period of uncertainty and must be capable of operating and even thriving in that medium.
