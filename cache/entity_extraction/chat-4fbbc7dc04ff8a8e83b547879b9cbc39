His intensive campaigns continued with the subjugation of Ossory and of Leinster by 986. \n165\n166\nThe Book of Rights lists dozens of strongholds built by previous kings of Cashel throughout Munster. \n167\nHe took a general obligation held by all property holders and converted it into specific responsibilities. Eaph of his projects was assigned the number of hides required to provide for the repairing and manning ofthat project. The Burghal Hidage states that \"For the maintenance and defence of an acre's breadth of wall, sixteen hides are required if every hide is represented by one man, then every pole can be manned by four men.\"\nHaving analyzed the needs of each fortification as far as upkeep and garrison size required, the king of Wessex then assigned each hide of land in his realm to the support of its own defensive work. Along with the planning of the division of labor and resources, Alfred required an administrative system capable of ensuring the execution of the plan.\nLike Brian Bora years later, Alfred turned to the most organized hierarchy availablethe Church. Alfred had always been a very pious and religious man.
