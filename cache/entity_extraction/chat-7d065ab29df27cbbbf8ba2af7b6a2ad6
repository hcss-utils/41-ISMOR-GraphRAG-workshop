Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

This call up, however, appears to be about the minimum force required before conducting an offensive operation outside of the tribal lands.\nIn making the decision to mobilize his people for military action, the king chose a time when taking the men away from their responsibilities would have a minimal impact.\nThe more time they spent on campaign, the fewer fields they planted, the fewer repairs to buildings and fences they accomplished, and the herds received less attention. To call a hosting of this magnitude involved more than just the personal whims of a ruler. A wellplanned expedition might catch an enemy unprepared, and by adding the levies to his household troops, the king could achieve a higher degree of success than by using merely his permanent retainers. Overwhelming his opponent enabled the king to secure hostages in return for the cessation of hostilities. Such a peace meant tribute as well as access to resources previously not under his control. with the additional numbers provided by using a levied host, the results of a mission were never preordained.\nThe assembling of a levy could extend the call for fighters to subordinate kings. The chronology and administration of this levy was simple and consistent. In a brief sketch, the process had two components: announcement of the intended campaign and the actual assembly. Messengers traveled throughout the kingdom announcing the call up, the location of the assembly, and the time of arrival there. Relatively quickly after the subordinate nobles received notice, they dispatched their own mess\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
