Former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said in 2011, \"one of the most striking elements of today's threat picture is that plots to attack America increasingly involve American citizens and permanent residents.\" 107 According to a New York Times report, since 2001, half of Jihadi terrorist attacks on the homeland were undertaken by men who were American citizens. \n108\n109\n110\nThis chapter has discussed the current threat of Jihadist terrorism, and the current intelligence structure the American homeland utilizes in order to defend against it. It then provided analysis into how the threat spectrum has shifted from FTOs to a bigger threat of lone-wolf actors. It then discussed some shortfalls within national strategy that fails to recognize this shift toward a lone-wolf Jihadist. As countering Jihadism is still a huge part of homeland security, it is only one of the three big threats facing the American homeland. The new threats Alt-Right terrorism and great power incursion will only continue to strain the homeland defenses and will be focused on in the next chapters. \nAnother recently deadly threat is the rise of the Alt-Right within the homeland.\nEven though terrorism has closely been associated with Jihadism in the post 9/11 world, there has been a rise in domestic terrorism associated with the Alt-Right across the United States.
