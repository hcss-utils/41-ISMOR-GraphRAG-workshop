This is not only the focal point of Islamic war, but also to all other aspects of Islam. It is the belief in Allah that marks the difference between a Muslim and a non-Muslim.\nMuslims' understanding of Allah is according to the narrations of Quran. In many parts of the Quran, Allah provides this understanding to the Muslims about His supreme being.\nThe most succinct explanation is found in Surah Al-Ikhlas: \"Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; and there is none like unto Him.\" 47 While Muslims should strive to strengthen this belief in themselves, they also have a sacred responsibility to protect this belief and ensure that proper worshipping of Allah is maintained without hindrance. When another group of people acts adversely to take away these belief and practices from Muslims, it is then that the Muslims wage war, and they fight until that protection is guaranteed. Therefore, logically, only Muslims can fight an Islamic war. By the word \"Muslim,\" it means anyone who believes in the concept of Allah as explained above, and believes Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as the last prophet of Allah. Anyone, whose belief contradicts with any of these two fundamental beliefs of Islam\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
