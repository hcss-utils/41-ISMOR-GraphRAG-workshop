Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

A herd of bullocks would have been an unthinkable phenomenon and it is to be suspected that all bull calves were killed at birth.\"\n109\nArchaeological sources and literature both provide evidence to question Lucas' assertion. Setting aside the literary sources for a moment, McCormick demonstrated the degree to which the Irish really did use cattle for meat. He asserted that meat was not the primary focus of breeding. Instead, when each cow bore a calf to stimulate the all important flow of milk, a substantial byproduct resulted -extra bulls. McCormick stated that \"The number of calves produced each year would, however, greatly exceed the number needed to maintain the herd at optimum size. This would be especially true in the case of male calves as only a small number would be required for breeding purposes.\" \n110\n111\n112\nBede noted that the favorable climate of Ireland eliminated the need to shelter animals or store hay for feeding them in winter; the animals could graze year round until needed for slaughter. \n113\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\nThe cattle produced in the Irish pastoral system were much smaller than modern beef animals.
