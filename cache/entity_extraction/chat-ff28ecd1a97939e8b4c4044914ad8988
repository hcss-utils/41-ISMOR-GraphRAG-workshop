Is the leadership of Al Qaeda under Osama Bin Laden or under Zawahiri acceptable to lead such group of Muslims? According to their background, words and ideology, they may have such authority; however, according to their conduct, they apparently lost that authority because they ordered their subordinates to commit forbidden acts, such as indiscriminate killing of non-Muslims, which is unacceptable in Islam.\nAl Qaeda's conduct in warfare and Islamic guidance While Al Qaeda might have an authentic cause to fight for, the biggest critique they have drawn from Muslims and non-Muslims alike is the way they conduct their war.\nIn general, they opted for guerilla warfare, as evident from the texts of Al-Muqrin and from pattern of operations they have demonstrated so far. Though no significant account of guerilla warfare can be found from the examples of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), it cannot be termed un-Islamic because Islam does not take a position on tactical methods like fighting in conventional or unconventional way. However, some of the conducts of Al Qaeda go against Islamic rulings. These include suicide bombing, and targeting of non-combatant civilians.\nSuicide is not a permissible act in Islam.
