Second, Islam guides the Muslims in every facet of life. Therefore, there must be guidelines on warfare, which can be termed as Islamic way of warfare.\nIn order to avoid interpreting actions of Muslims that might have external influences, only the Quran, life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his immediate companions in the 7th century have been in the subject of this research. Although Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received the first revelation from Allah in 610 AD, the first battle he led (at Badr) did not occur until 624 AD. Since then, until his demise in 633 AD, he fought eight major battles, led eighteen expeditions and planned thirty eight other military operations. \n2\nBecause of contradictory explanations found about the term Islamic way of warfare, the primary research question for this research was \"What is the Islamic way of warfare?\" In order to find a structured approach to reveal the answer of this question, the secondary research questions were:\n1. What is a way of warfare (Characteristics that make a way of warfare)?\n2. What are the guidelines on warfare given in the Quran, and practiced or ordered by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?\nBesides, it is important to understand how a war fought by Muslims can be compared to the concept of Islamic way of warfare.
