Identify all entities.

In both 2016 and 2017, Russia launched massive campaigns to infiltrate American homeland critical infrastructure. \n217\n218\n219\n220\nThe Russian election meddling and its cyber-attacks against the homeland's infrastructure are troubling developments. Not only will Russia continue to challenge the United States across the globe, but it also has interest in the targeting the American way of life. Unfortunately, Russia is not the only Great Power the United States has to confront.\nAs Russia seeks to cause chaos within an enemy state, China takes a much different approach in targeting the American homeland. Like Russia, China also views the United States as its most formidable adversary. While Russia knows it must weaken a state in order to succeed due to its relative decline in recent years, China instead pushes to defeat that state through reverse engineering of stolen material, and seeks to portray itself in a positive light to the world community. Rather than creating unrest with American homeland, China instead targets American academics and businesses in order to steal intellectual property (IP) and gain the advantage. \n221\n222\nThe most recent and successful operation in IP theft against the American homeland has been China's \"Thousand Talents Program.\" \n223\n224\n225\n226\n234\nThe recent great power incursion by Russia and China into American society adds the final and perhaps most important layer to the current three-pronged attack.
