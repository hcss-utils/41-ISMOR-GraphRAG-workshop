Operational Maneuver also provides precision engagement ranging from one well trained individual to an expeditionary force. Overall, Operational Maneuver appears more applicable to gaining \"preeminence in any form of conflict.\"\nOperational Maneuver is a concept that is largely compatible with the desired capabilities sought in JV 2010. It provides commanders with dominant maneuver and precision engagement across the conflict spectrum and from the sea. Sea basing provides additive force protection while enhancing logistics and operational flexibility. Information superiority as outlined in JV 2010 does not do justice to C 2 requirements as the Marines define them, but it does pose the requirement for offensive and defensive information warfare, an emerging field which neither the Marine Corps nor Operational Maneuver from the Sea have addressed explicitly.\nAlthough the overall intent and content of JV 2010 are laudable, considerable work remains to validate and implement it. The devil is in the details and creating a process that allows the joint community to move from general concepts to concrete combat capabilities. The evolution will have its challenges. Until they are addressed, bringing JV 2010 to fruition will be an elusive goal.\nJV 2010 makes a few references to high quality people, professional training, and the need for physical presence in the form of \"boots on the ground/' but it has a clear technological focus. We must avoid the illusion of attempting to impose certainty on the battlefield. 8 Technology offers improvements in the speed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
