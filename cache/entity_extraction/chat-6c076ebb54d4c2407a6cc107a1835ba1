As these groups push out racist and radical viewpoints online or in-person, their members or viewers of their content can become radicalized by their dogmas. The last and most critical analysis of the Alt-Right threat will be the study of its lone-wolf actors.\nThe current Alt-Right threat to the homeland has centered on lone-wolf attackers who commit atrocities based on the ideologies discussed above. While Alt-Right lonewolves such as Dylan Roof, Robert Bowers, and Patrick Crusius have become our greatest threat, experts have found that these lone wolves are actually not truly alone. In In fact, Dylan Roof, Robert Bowers, and Patrick Crusius all used either 4chan, 8chan, or Gab to publish their manifestos or reasons behind their attacks. According to Berger, the publishing of online manifestos became prevalent after the attacks in Norway undertaken by Anders Breivik. \n160\nWhile the lone wolf may undertake the attack single-handedly, the motivation clearly been influenced by online extremist propaganda.
