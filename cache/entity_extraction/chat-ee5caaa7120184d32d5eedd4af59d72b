Identify all entities.

Significantly, these structures rest upon a foundation of principles of operations which provide broad guidance in planning and execution across the range of operations, Additionally, the doctrine integrates an assessment of those characteristics of operations that tend to produce success within overall framework. To sum up, in its functional orientation FM 100-5 presents a comprehensive structural system that describes and prescribes how to employ Army forces in major combat and non-combat operations. The new Air Force basic doctrine has a different focus.\nAFDD-1 is largely descriptive rather than prescriptive. It is not operations doctrine in the same way as is FM 100-5. It defines its charter, as the basic doctrine of the Air Force, as having two aspects.\nFirst, it acts as the foundation of all aerospace doctrine by stating the most fundamental and enduring beliefs which describe and guide the proper use of air and space forces in military action. Second, it provides broad and continuing guidance on how Air Force forces are prepared and employed. \n87\nThe emphasis AFDD-1 places on describing Air Force aerospace power explains the second main structural difference it has with FM 100-5, that is in the integration of operating systems into the overall doctrinal structure.\nWith a focus on force employment, FM 100-5 links the Army force structure into its framework.\nIts operating system structure describes the character and purpose of its current forces\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
