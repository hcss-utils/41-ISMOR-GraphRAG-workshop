Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It was identified that Islam does not guide matters of minor tactics of war, but provides a broader framework within which Muslims can fight. It also provides a few restrictions and allowances for the conduct of the war. In essence, Islam guides Muslims about when they can fight (just cause), what they should fight for (objectives), and offer limited guidance on the actual conduct of war.\nChapter 4 is solely focused on identifying the causes, objectives and conduct of Al Qaeda. Because of the reason that there is no guidance about minor tactics in Islam, discussion on Al Qaeda's doctrine is also kept limited to those three factors mentioned above: the cause, objective, and conducts that relates to the guidance of Islam.\nFinally, chapter 5 brings out the comparison between the Al Qaeda's way of war and the Islamic way of warfare identified in chapter 3. It also provides a deeper understanding of the position of warfare in Islam. Finally it contains recommendations for US and other Western nations in general about engaging with Muslims and extremist militant groups.\nSince the author is a Muslim, the name \"Allah\" is used throughout the paper to mean God. The concept of Allah's being is explained in brief in chapter 3, and that idea is carried throughout the paper whenever any reference is drawn from the Quran.\nMuslims believe that the Quran is the word of Allah, revealed over time through the angel Jibrael (Gabriel) to the Prophet Muhammad (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
