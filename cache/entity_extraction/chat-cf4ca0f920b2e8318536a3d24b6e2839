Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Some of the female calves would be marked to replace older cows nearing the end of their usefulness. One or two of the male calves would be selected to replace an ox.\nMost, however, met the slaughterer's axe.\nThe idea that the Irish used surplus calves for meat production has neither been widely articulated nor accepted. A.T. Lucas wrote that \"There are no beef-eating heroes in Irish literature; the doughtiest Irish warriors relied on pig-meat for their intake of protein. A herd of bullocks would have been an unthinkable phenomenon and it is to be suspected that all bull calves were killed at birth.\"\n109\nArchaeological sources and literature both provide evidence to question Lucas' assertion. Setting aside the literary sources for a moment, McCormick demonstrated the degree to which the Irish really did use cattle for meat.
