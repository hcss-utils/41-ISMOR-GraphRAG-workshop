Islam is a very strong religion that has deep-rooted position in most Muslims' mind. Therefore, trying to minimize its influence on Muslims by imposing other ideology or concepts usually does not work well. One needs to understand that Islam, in its best practices, has all the characteristics that can stop terrorist acts and promote good order in the society. If the Western nations' main concern is the stability and security of the Middle East region, the best ideology that can make it happen is Islam itself. If proper Islamic authorities are in control of their state affairs and people, it will not promote violence, rather minimize it. An Islamic society, who draws their lessons from the core sources of Islam in its right context, will never be a threat to the non-Muslim states, unless they are physically threatened. If Western nations have economic interest in the Middle East region, the people that they can trust best are the Muslim traders who conduct themselves according to Islamic rulings. Because these traders will be morally bounded by their religion to conduct trade in the fairest way, they can be considered as the most reliable persons. In fact, it was the Muslim traders of 7th and 8th centuries, who attracted many non-Muslims in the South Asia and South East Asia towards Islam by their good conduct and fair trading. The best motivational tool that works for Muslims is their religion.
