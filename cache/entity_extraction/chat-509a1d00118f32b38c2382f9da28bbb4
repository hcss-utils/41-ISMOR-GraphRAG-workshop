The structural difference between the basic doctrine is evident in three important ways. First, while both use a system of conceptual structures to organize thinking about operations, the focus of each basic doctrine is different which accounts for a part of the structural difference. Second, the variance in the integration of current forces into the structure provides insight to the tactical mechanics of each service's operational concept. Third, the relationship of military operations other than war to combat operations reflects the doctrinal emphasis on the range of military operations.\nFM 100-5 stresses fighting and winning. It is \"the Army's keystone warfighting manual.\" In establishing the Army's operational doctrine, it presents an official interpretation of operational art and a basic tactical description of how the Army fights. However, beyond warfighting, it also presents a comprehensive approach to all Army operations. This focus produces a functionally oriented set of three interrelated frameworks to support its operational perspective: core functions, operating systems, and categories of operations. The nature of the relationship between these conceptual structures illustrates the point.\nFM 100-5 begins with a structure that describes the most fundamental military functions: see, shape, shield, strike, move. It links those core functions\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
