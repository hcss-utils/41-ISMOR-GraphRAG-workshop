FM 100-5 maintains a prescriptive, functional approach in describing how to employ Army forces to achieve a broad range of potential missions. The resulting doctrinal structures support that approach and provide an integrated progression of ideas describing fundamental functions and fielded systems and employment guidance. In contrast, AFDD-1 is not operations doctrine and takes a more descriptive approach and creates a framework that applies the unique capabilities of aerospace power to the demands of contemporary US security challenges. Though it describes the Air Force operational concept, it restrains from addressing tactical force employment.\nAFDD-1 establishes a point of departure for emerging operational doctrine and strategic context for tactical doctrine. Though the focus of the doctrinal documents is significantly different they describe similar and complementary operational concepts.\nFlexibility: This idea springs from the freedom, speed, and range of maneuver of air and space forces. This quality allows for the aerospace forces to adapt rapidly to changing situations and project massed effects more quickly and more extensively than surface forces.\nVersatility: Aerospace forces can prosecute warfare on all levels simultaneously. Flexibility and precision weapons allow strategic, operational, and tactical targets to be attacked in parallel (simultaneously) rather than sequentially. Additionally, many modern combat aircraft have the range, payload, and survivability to attack target sets at all levels of war\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
