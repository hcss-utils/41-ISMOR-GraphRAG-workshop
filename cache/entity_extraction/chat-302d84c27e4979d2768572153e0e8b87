It will first look at works focusing on the debates about civil liberties; then it will shift toward discussions about the United Kingdom's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, which is often described as effective. Finally, it will conclude with literature concerning the current United States domestic intelligence structure and recommendations to change it.\nAlthough the United States appears to currently be in uncharted territory based on these three challenging threats, the debate on domestic intelligence is not new. The initial debate over national security vs. civil liberties was sparked by the Church Committee findings of 1976, in which Congress noted that both the FBI and CIA violated the constitutional rights of Americans through the surveillance of their activities. \n13\n14\nThis dynamic that pits national security against its citizens' civil liberties is an essential debate for American democracy. Genevieve Lester argues that if a new domestic counterterrorism agency is to be formed, it must be transparent, and must conform to the current system of checks and balances that other government agencies abide. \n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nAs Lester, Martin, and Baker have argued these important points about civil liberties, their ideas have also been countered. Erik Dahl counters Lester's claim of the \"pendulum\" by reasoning that balance between current security and civil liberty is actually not balanced, but rather heavily favors security. \n22\n23\nOne of the most successful domestic intelligence agencies is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
