Did Irish armies have any specific structure? Or were battles and raids chance encounters between wandering bands organized only for the moment? A quick glance at the annals lends credence to the idea that the attacks and violence had form. Most entries begin with the king or kingdom that conducted the attack and, as such, warfare possibly had political implications. If so, then the starting point for examining how kings raised armies begins with the question of why they raised them.\nThe reasons for raising the army influenced how it was built. While seemingly a simple task, the assembly of a fighting force involves a complex variety of factors. In that, Ireland is no different from any other land. Kings used violence for a multitude of reasons, big and small.\nConsequently, they had need of flexibility in the composition of their army. From pre-history to the coming of the Normans in the twelfth century, Irish kings conducted violent operations against one another. The types of forces used depended on three basic factors: one, the resources commanded by each leader; two, the length of time that the f'f^the Book\"f K ^arman king had to prepare; and finally, the general political Source: Fr^cmse Hajry, Tfe\nBook of Kelts (New York: Alfred A.
