Many politicians and academics openly defined terrorist tactics since 9/11 as an \"Islamic way of warfare.\" It is very strange that Islam, a religion that claims to promote peace, can provide guidelines to terrorists who seem to choose killing innocent civilians and destroying public property to prove their strength. This contradiction requires research to identify what is truly an Islamic way of warfare, and how much relevance it has with the ideology and tactics of today's extremist groups.\nThe concept of defining a certain \"way of warfare\" is relatively recent. Historians like Geoffrey Parker and John Keegan, after detail study of the wars involving Western nations, defined a Western way of warfare with a distinct set of characteristics, which all or most Western nations have followed. This concept of defining a way of warfare raises the question: if there is a western way of warfare, are there other ways of warfare, too? Though much research has not been done to find the answer to this question, many academics and politicians have chosen to use the phrase way of warfare and used it indiscriminately to explain their views. The most current example in today's world is the Islamic way of warfare.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
