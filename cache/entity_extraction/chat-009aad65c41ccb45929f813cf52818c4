Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The annals, a critical foundation for any study of the period, lack the details necessary for an in-depth look at the specifics of war. They only provide a skeleton outline of the yearly happenings in Ireland. Written by monastic scribes, this information includes obituaries of kings and church leaders, notices of battles and raids, and even unusual events such as an entry in 911 A.D. that noted \"A rainy and dark year. A comet [Haley's Comet] appeared.\"\n5\n6\nAfter the conclusion of the Chronicle of Ireland, other chronicles have an independent importance. The Annals of Inisfallen are a compilation of an abbreviated version of the 'Chronicle' and local information from Munster. \n8\nFortunately, other sources are available to provide useful information to develop a detailed model of military logistics. One source is heroic literature, specifically the stories of the Ulster Cycle. This cycle focuses on the adventures of the men of Ulster and is set sometime in the centuries around the birth of Christ. 9 These tales have been used mainly for their value in understanding the mythology of pre-Christian Ireland; they have not yet been questioned in an\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
