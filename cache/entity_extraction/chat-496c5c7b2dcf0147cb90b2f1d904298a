It explains the unique effect WMD has on operations through an explanation of their effect on the framework of the core functions. Part V of the new doctrine injects Army operations into potential complexities of operations in today's world environment.\nThe draft FM 100-5 uses a broad conceptual approach to structure fundamental ideas and methodology as well as prescriptive guidance for a broad spectrum of Army operations. It presents basic principles, imperatives, and characteristics for command, planning and execution. The Air Force approaches its basic doctrine from a slightly different angle.\nThe focus of AFDD-1 is on applying aerospace power to US national security challenges, with a clear emphasis on warfighting. The development team presents a general perspective on aerospace power in four chapters: the nature of aerospace power, its operational employment, readiness and sustainment, and force organization.\nAFDD-1 begins by introducing the idea of aerospace power as a unique aspect of modern warfare and an instrument of national policy. A term central to the entire document, the new doctrine defines \"aerospace power\" and promulgates operating tenets that reflect \"current air and space power qualities.\" \n19\nChapter Two of AFDD-1 introduces the basic doctrinal structure for \"operationalizing,\" that is expressing in terms of missions directly applicable to military operations, the idea of aerospace power.
