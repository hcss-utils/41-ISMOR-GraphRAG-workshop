Doi, Shariah: The Islamic Law (London: Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd,  1984), 33-38.   3   Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Meaning of The Holy Quran (Maryland: Amana Publications,), 413.  This chapter highlights the way of warfare followed by Al Qaeda since its inception, focusing on areas where comparison can be drawn between its way of warfare with Islamic warfare described in the previous chapter. Though the leaders of Al Qaeda defend their actions by quoting from the Quran and Sunnah, one needs to examine if their explanation of the fundamental sources are acceptable and unbiased. As discussed in the chapter 3, a just Islamic war has to meet two different tests: intention or cause, and conduct. Accordingly, this chapter will initially focus on the causes that motivated Al Qaeda's actions, by analyzing the proclamations made by its leaders about their intent and objectives. Then the major characteristics of their conduct will be examined based on media reports and records found in books and periodicals. The comparison between Al Qaeda and the Islamic way of warfare will be completed in the next chapter.\nSince its inception in the 1980s, Al Qaeda's objectives can be divided in to two broad categories: the Anti-Soviet phase and the Anti-Western phase. The Anti-Soviet phase covers the period from 1988 until 1989 when Al Qaeda fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This phase ended\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
