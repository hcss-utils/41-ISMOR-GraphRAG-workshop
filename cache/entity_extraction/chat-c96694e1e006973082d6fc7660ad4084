In the annals of the United Nations this will long be remembered as the \"war resolution.\"\nFirst, the draft resolution before us does not exclude the use of force and is so broad and vague that it is not limited to the purpose of enforcing implementation of the 10 resolutions on the Gulf crisis adopted by the Security Council. Hence, it will be up to those States with military forces in the area to decide on the prerequisites for the restoration of international peace and security in the region, which might well lead to a military confrontation on a larger scale.\nIf such a catastrophe should ever occur, then the new world order, which is a source of hope in the future, would be wrecked at the very outset through this grave military escalation in the region, especially if force is used outside the authority of the Security Council.\nThis would be in the cards because those who advocate it enthusiastically do not do so from a desire to uphold the interests of Kuwait but rather to destroy Arab capabilities and tilt the scales in furtherance of Zionism's objectives and expansionist policies. \n4 2\nNo one can escape the reality that the unleashing today\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
