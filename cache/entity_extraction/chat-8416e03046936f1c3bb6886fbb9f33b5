The chapter then concluded with an analysis of the current posture. While hate groups like the Patriot Front or the American Identity Movement can be monitored, the American who holds radical Alt-Right beliefs could blend in with everyday society and escape law enforcement scrutiny. These last two chapters have shown that the methods employed by Jihadist and Alt-Right terrorists against the American homeland are actually extremely similar. While one young American could be radicalized online to undertake Jihad against his fellow citizens, another young American who lives down the street could be radicalized to undertake an Alt-Right attack. While the ideologies are different, the methods are the same, and both potential terrorists can easily blend in with American society. This increasing threat will continue to stretch the homeland's intelligence structure, and the recent rise of great power incursion will add another element to the challenge for homeland security, law enforcement, and intelligence.\nThe third and final element of the current threats facing the American homeland is the new threat of great power incursion. As Jihadist and Alt-Right terrorism will continue to target American citizens, great power incursion has a different nature that seeks to undermine American society and its institutions, rather than target its population directly.\nWhile GPC between the United States, China, and Russia has become a global conflict in the past decade, this chapter will not discuss the contentious areas of the South China Sea, or the battlefields of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
