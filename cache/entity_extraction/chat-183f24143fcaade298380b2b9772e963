Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

For this purpose, the intensity of the interdependencies is investigated in the sense of a sensitivity analysis, and their result is represented on an ordinary scale using values of zero (no influence) to three (very strong influence.) One influencing factor is always considered as the cause and its influence on the initially constant values of the others is investigated. The effects thus identified are then transferred to a common matrix for further processing (cf. As the final result of the sensitivity analysis, it is possible to determine which influencing factor exerts a strong effect on others -thus tending to be active in the system and which factor is strongly influenced by others -therefore tending to be passive. The total score of a factor in the area of cause (degree of activity) and effect (degree of passivity) is compared with the total score awarded for further calculation. The resulting values now provide information about the intensity of the cause and the intensity of the effect of each influencing factor in the system of intellectual capital. \n45\nThis type of intensity calculation assumes a weighted linear correlation in the interaction of the influencing factors and does not take into account any temporal dimension of the interaction in a long-term perspective. \n46\nThe calculated results can be displayed afterwards in a data diagram with the degree of activity on the ordinate axis and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
