Identify all entities.

They concluded \"effective decision making can also be delayed and even derailed by collaboration. In certain cases, [they] observed a commander's understanding of the current Blue or Red disposition degraded as a result of collaboration with subordinates, peers, or higher headquarters commanders.\" 26 Several trends lead to this performance. The first being commander's usually fixated on individual information on their C2 screens and failed to see the battlefield as a whole. In addition, they concluded the more a decision maker shifts attention, the more shallow the cognitive process they apply to the overall picture. 27 This is related to Dr Miller's research on the \"Magic Number 7\" and information overload.
