It is also customary for Muslims to say \"Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam,\" meaning \"Peace be upon him,\" after mentioning Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)'s name.\nSo the abbreviated form \"PBUH\" has been used throughout the paper after the name of the Prophet. The word \"Prophet\" is used before his name as a gesture of honor, as well as to distinguish him from his companions, as Muhammad was a common name in contemporary Arab society.\nThe primary target reader for this thesis paper is layman non-Muslims and Muslims, who have some or no knowledge about Islam. Use of too many religious terms has been intentionally avoided to make is easily readable and understandable for the intended audience. However, scholars of Islam can also find important references in this thesis, which may help them to study similar concepts in further detail. This thesis does not discuss all of the Islamic laws and guidance on warfare in detail. It is highly focused on the two most important sources of Islam -the Quran and\nHadith. The references from the Quran and Hadith are further explained by Islamic scholars of past and present. One who is interested to know more about these religious sources should look for texts of renowned Muslim scholars. This thesis focuses on the core idea from those concepts and explains them in a basic form, just to give the readers an understanding about where to find references.
