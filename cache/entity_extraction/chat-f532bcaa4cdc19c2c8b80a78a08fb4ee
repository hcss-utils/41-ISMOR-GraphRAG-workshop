FM 100-5 describes the importance and purpose of the principles of operations: \"The 11 principles of operations are the foundation of Army doctrine. They instruct and inform our conduct of operations at all levels. There is no priority among the principles. Indeed, they should not be viewed independently of one another, but as a collective whole.\" 69 A list and definitions of these principles are contained in Appendix E. The characteristics of Army operations (listed and defined in Appendix H) provide guidance indirectly by describing those qualities that lead to success in the current approach to operations. The Army's concept of operations evolved from these sets of ideas. The principles of operations and characteristics of operations can be considered the intellectual origin and foundation of the structures that describe Army operations and an integral part of its operational concept.\nFM 100-5 begins its chapter \"The Army's Operational Concept\" by applying its basic functional structure to the demands of national security: \"Army forces accomplish assigned missions worldwide by executing offensive, defensive, stability, and support operations.\" Using the core functions as a starting point, it expands the idea by describing the conduct of operations in the dimensions of time and space and in terms of combinations of actions.\nThe new doctrine transmits a vision of an aggressive, fast paced approach to the conduct of operations. This vision seeks to dominate the dimensions of time and space:\nArmy units strike simultaneously\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
