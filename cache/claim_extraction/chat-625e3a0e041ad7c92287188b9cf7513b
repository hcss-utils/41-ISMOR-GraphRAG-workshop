Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This is not an uncommon way to see war, but it could differ somewhat from the Western understanding. In the Soviet view, the underlying policy of a government remained, while it used peace or war as instruments to further its policy depending on circumstance (Vigor 1975, 8) . In other words, \"Peace is assessed in precisely the same way as war\" (Lider 1977, 223) . In the West, Peter Vigor argued, perhaps provocatively, that war was conversely understood as a \"terrible disaster which bursts upon men as a kind of act of god, erupting for no reason and conducted for purposes which are never implemented when the fighting has stopped\" (Vigor 1975, 5) . This argument hinted at clearer understanding of war's instrumental role. The consequence of this view is both war and peace as instruments of policy. In Lenin's view, Vigor contended, it would have been ridiculous to think of peace as apart from war; rather, if war was the continuation of politics, peace needed to be as well (Vigor 1975, 87) . The Soviet view entailed an understanding that peace, in any other sense than an absence of fighting, was unattainable as long as a capitalist system existed (Scott and Scott 1988, 113)\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
