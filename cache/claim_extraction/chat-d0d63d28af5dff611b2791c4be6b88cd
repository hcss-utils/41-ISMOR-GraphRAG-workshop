Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

These are very interesting sentiments to compare to Bogdanov's later views (see below), as his focus at this time was how the use of conventional military means deliver a victory. It is furthermore worth noting that his thinking about future war is almost identical to Slipchenko's.\nSimilarly, Col. Sergei Chekinov, also from the Center for Military-Strategic Studies, who later coauthored several articles with Bogdanov, discussed modern wars with Col. Oleg Orekhov. Chekinov and Orekhov also explicitly drew upon Slipchenko's theories. They contended that \"aerospace attack and defense are becoming . . . the main weapon of twenty-first century wars, especially in the initial period of war\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 17) . They saw that \"the aerospace sphere is steadily increasing relative to actions in other spheres of armed struggle\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) . Moreover, they saw that the aerospace forces relied heavily on information and that \"war acquires a qualitatively new component-information. This is due to the emergence of weapon systems based on the extensive use of information technology\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 16) . It is noteworthy that their emphasis on information is related to the application of military means rather than the information\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
