Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

A particularly noteworthy event in Messner's career and theorizing came in 1919 when he was tasked to run a newspaper, Voluntary Effort, to support the Whites, which Messner recalled as his first step toward specializing in propaganda (Domnin 2005, 24) . In 1921, Messner settled in Belgrade, where he taught, wrote, and became a professor of military science. However, in the spring of 1945, when Soviet and Allied forces approached, Messner fled to Argentina (Domnin 2005, 38) , where he published his most notable works, Lik sovremmeny voiny (The face of modern war) in 1959, Myatezh-imya tretyey vsemirnoy (Subversion-the name of the third worldwide war) in 1960, and Vsemirnaya myatezhvoina (Worldwide subversion-war). Messner's theorizing centered on the concept of myatezhvoina, literally translated as \"mutiny, \" \"insurgency, \" or \"rebellion. \" However, as Messner was referring to myatezhvoina as distinct from guerrilla warfare and referred to eroding moral and societal cohesion\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
