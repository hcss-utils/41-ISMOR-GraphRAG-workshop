Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Revolution can be seen as the link between the class struggle and war (Peralta 2005, 95) .\nThe perception of war as having the potential to speed up the revolutionary process was strengthened by the First World War and the following Russian Revolution when the Bolsheviks came to power and by the Second World War when the Soviet Union established control over half of Central Europe (Light 1988, 21) . Byely et al. (1972, 15) stated that war could also delay or hasten the development of the class society. Here it is useful to add the context of the development of military theory in the early days of the Soviet Union. In a passage of history less remembered by Western states than in the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States were involved in the Russian Civil War, supporting the White movement against the Bolsheviks (Glantz 1992, 9) . Thus, the foundational policy and military doctrine of the Soviet Union matured in the context of an \"internal struggle and foreign intervention [that] threatened the fledgling Bolshevik regime's existence\" (Glantz 1992, 5) .\nAt the core of the Marxist view of war was thus a paradox. On the one hand, war was perceived as something evil that could be remedied only by the transformation of the whole world to communism and the concomitant eradication\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
