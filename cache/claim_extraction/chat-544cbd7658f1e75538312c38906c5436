Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

He held that there have always been orators, agitators, and preachers as tools of war but that the advent of global communications has vastly increased the potential to impact the minds of others (Burenok 2014) . This, Burenok argued, had developed in Yugoslavia, where the goal of the information war was to affect the consciousness of the people and justify the actions taken. In North Africa, such methods had been used to degrade the state and in Libya specifically to promote civil war. Last, he saw that the refinement of information warfare continued with Ukraine, where \"the aim [was] regime change by the changing of mass consciousness\" (Burenok 2014 ). Burenok's argument is noteworthy both because of its merits and because he argued more straightforwardly than others that these changes indeed represented a change in the essence of war. Other theorists that have seen information warfare as equally important have often not argued for a change in the nature, or essence, of war.\nIn 2014, the military theorists Valery Konyzhev and Aleksandr Sergunin published a book titled Sovremennaya voyennaya strategiya (Modern military strategy), in which they analyzed the state of Russian military theory. They presented a typology of the development of Russian thinking on war that contained two broad schools: traditionalists (conservatives) and nontraditionalists (innovators) (Konyzhev and Sergunin\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
