Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Serebryannikov concluded that nonmilitary means cannot be considered nonviolent, because they have such large effects that could amount to the use of force.\nThis view, however, was too narrow for Aleksandr Kalistratov, a professor in operational art at the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces, who wrote a study investigating the definition of armed conflict from historical and philosophical perspectives. Kalistratov argued for an understanding of armed conflict by drawing upon the term \"struggle\" (borba), which he defined as \"efforts to overcome your adversary, [a] contest between two forces\" and then simply added \"armed\" (vooruzhennaya) to describe when an entity is equipped with manufactured means for the struggle (Kalistratov 2004, 151-52) . He found this definition preferable to the narrower view that others, such as Sokolovsky, have held-that war was defined by armed violence and nothing else. The problem, Kalistratov contended, was that this missed the other essential activities in war. He continued to argue that in the previous ten years, there had been a gradual shift away from the traditional domain of armed violence to others. This shift meant that armed struggle will \"embrace the geophysical, ecological, ethnic, psychological and emotional\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
