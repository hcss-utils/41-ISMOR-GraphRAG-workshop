Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

In October 2018, Gerasimov echoed the notion of Russia being in an information war in the foreword to the new edition of Gareyev's book Battles on the Military-Historical Front (Pershutkin 2018) .\nThis view of the information war was also shared by the Russian public. In December 2014, 80 percent of the respondents to a Levada Center poll felt that Russia was in an information war, divided more of less equally as to whether Ukraine or the West had started it (Levada Center 2014a). In November 2015, the share of respondents believing Russia was in an information war was down to 44 percent (Levada Center 2015) . Two and a half years later, in June 2017, the number had surged again, and 69 percent believed that Russia was in an information war (Levada Center 2017) .\nThis notion was also echoed by a few Western analysts. Giles saw that \"examining Russian assessments of current events makes it clear that it considers itself to be engaged in full-scale information warfare\" (Giles 2016b, 27; Giles 2015b, 1) . He added that \"the perceived threat is an existential one\" (Giles 2016b, 37) .
