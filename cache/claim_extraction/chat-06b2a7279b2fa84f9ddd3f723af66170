Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

They \"openly state their belief that the country is facing an information or network war (by which they mean hostile media criticism of Putin's increasingly autocratic regime)\" (Blank 2008a, 238) . However, it is worth remembering that not all writing about propaganda refers to the perceived threat from the West. The long-standing problem with terrorism in Russia, especially from the North Caucasus, has also played out in the information sphere. As described above, an integral part of the Chechens' strategy was their ability to conduct information operations, recruitment, and propaganda dissemination on the Internet. Nonetheless, it is clear that the main perpetrator of this information war against Russia was perceived to be the West.\nThe idea of Russia being in the middle of an information war has been shared by many Russian theorists since. For example, while commenting on relations with the EU over Ukraine, Aleksandr Mikhailov, a retired FSB major general, stated that information warfare has been going on since the birth of humanity (Pravda 2014). However, now technology has advanced so far that its potential has increased significantly. Regarding Russia being under attack, he saw that the goals of the enemy were obvious: \"a complete demoralisation of the Russian population and then the demoralisation of Russian authorities and administration\" (Pravda 2014). Thus, it seems that the conclusion of the wide definition of information-psychological warfare is that there is an ongoing attack against Russia\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
