Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

The doctrines hold formal status as the basis for national security planning. Moreover, following Soviet tradition, these doctrines are useful to analyze because they go far beyond Western ones in terms of what questions they answer and their military-theoretical depth and detail. The military doctrines not only direct the armed forces but the whole of the state's organization for war (voyennoye organisatsiya gosudarstvo).\nThe statements of the political elites are important as they reveal perceptions of war among those in power. A drawback of analyzing the political elites' statements is that they are less likely to venture into depth on military issues or have a military-theoretical foundation. Among the political elites, particular weight is given to the president, the minister of defense, and the head of the Security Council. The military theorists are crucial as they have the militarytheoretical expertise to analyze how war is changing. Among military theorists, the views of the chief of the General Staff-the highest-ranking officer, the deputy defense minister, and the person with the utmost responsibility in leading the military-theoretical development-are of particular importance. This book will also focus on theorists involved in drafting the public security doctrines and with influential positions in the military-theoretical debates and the General Staff.\nTo be clear, there is no such thing as a single understanding of war, either in Russia or elsewhere. It is an aggregate of different views that can be more or less conforming.\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
