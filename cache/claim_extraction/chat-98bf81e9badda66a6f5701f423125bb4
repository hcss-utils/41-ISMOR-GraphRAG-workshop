Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The discussion follows the customary Russian division of information-technical warfare and information-psychological warfare. The importance of information-technical warfare increased after the Gulf War, when Iraqi troops relying on Soviet mat\u00e9riel and doctrines were defeated by a technologically superior, but numerically inferior, US military. The importance of the information-psychological sphere increased during the Chechen wars.\nThe perceived threat from color revolutions is analyzed in chapter 4. The color revolutions contained a degree of Western nonmilitary support, which mainly consisted of the work of NGOs, political and diplomatic support, and financial support for democracy and human rights. As opposition groups in the color revolution states rallied under the banner of democracy and human rights and were supported by Western countries (mainly the United States), the color revolutions became seen by Russian political and military elites as an instrument for engineering regime change. This view was cemented with the Arab Spring, whose protests carried over to the Russian elections of 2011-12 and the Euromaidan revolt, after which Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.\nLast, the book will end with a conclusion and policy recommendations for those who are handling the conflict with Russia.\n1.
