Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, now technology has advanced so far that its potential has increased significantly. Regarding Russia being under attack, he saw that the goals of the enemy were obvious: \"a complete demoralisation of the Russian population and then the demoralisation of Russian authorities and administration\" (Pravda 2014). Thus, it seems that the conclusion of the wide definition of information-psychological warfare is that there is an ongoing attack against Russia. Expressing a similar notion, Anatoly Maruyev, a military theorist, argued that \"since Russia's geopolitical opponents, in particular, the U.S. and its allies, have intensified geopolitical rivalry and the information war they have started against Russia, it is important for this country to respond to the information war adequately to maintain its own information security\" (Maruyev 2009, 8) .\nA similar view was given by Nikolai Borduzha, secretary-general of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and a former secretary of the Russian Security Council and chief of presidential staff. He stated that \"essentially, a full-scale information war has been launched in the global information space\" (Borduzha 2014, 31) . This was done by \"powerful media pressure on states subject to external intervention\" (Borduzha 2014, 31) . This perception was later echoed by Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov, who,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
