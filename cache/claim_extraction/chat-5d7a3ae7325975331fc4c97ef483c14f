Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Furthermore, he argued that \"our Western partners have crossed the line\" (Putin 2014a ). Thus, he emphasized the color revolutions as a pattern and foreign values as part of color revolutions. On another occasion, he equated color revolutions with extremism, arguing that \"in the modern world extremism is being used as a geopolitical instrument for remaking spheres of influence. We see what tragic consequences the wave of so-called color revolutions led to\" (Korsunskaya 2014) .\nThe downfall of the Yanukovych government only increased the fear within the Russia leadership. In Russia's (formerly) closest state, the population had overthrown a corrupt and autocratic leader. While analyzing the Russian debate on what happened in Ukraine, Aleksandr Sergunin noted that \"the pro-Kremlin analysts fear that the 'Maidan-type virus' can spread to Russia and jeopardise the Putin regime which has much in common with the Yanukovych one\" (Sergunin 2014, 86) . This fear indeed is an important backdrop to understand why Russia invaded Ukraine. Roy Allison argued that \"for Putin, the presumed association between these protests, earlier 'color revolutions' and now the new Maidan revolution in Kiev was difficult to swallow.
