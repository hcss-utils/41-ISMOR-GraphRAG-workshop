Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Furthermore, this view was not only shared by political and military elites but held by the public as well. A poll from the Levada Center in December 2014 showed \"the desire of the US to organize another color revolution in Ukraine\" to be by far the most popular response (48 percent) to the question asking why the crisis in Ukraine started (Levada Center 2014b). The second most popular explanation was Yanukovich's corruption, at 28 percent (Levada Center 2014b).\nThis understanding was reflected by Lavrov. In a speech at the end of 2014 touching on the topic of hybrid war, he argued that it had been popular to accuse Russia of waging it in Crimea and Ukraine but that he \"would apply the term above to the United States and its war strategy-it is truly a hybrid war aimed not so much at defeating the enemy military as at changing the regimes in the states that pursue a policy Washington does not like\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). For Lavrov, this strategy consisted of \"using financial and economic pressure, information attacks, using others on the perimeter of a corresponding state as proxies and of course information and ideological pressure through externally financed non-governmental organisations\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). This strategy was, for Lavrov, also used directly against Russia.
