Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

He furthermore saw that information resources had become one of the most effective weapons. Similarly, Chekinov and Bogdanov saw that unconventional warfare and warfare of controlled chaos were defining international relations today, in which nonmilitary means, notably information and psychological warfare, were key to victory. This made military means secondary, and they saw that nonmilitary means could remove military threats. Moreover, Kartapolov saw that indirect actions were a new type of war in parallel with classical war. Many theorists, most notably Gareyev, also saw that the nonmilitary means were so effective that they should be considered violent in nature. Therefore, Gareyev called for a reconsideration of the whole system of knowledge surrounded war, traditionally defined by armed violence.\nEven though several theorists have argued for views that would entail a change in the nature of war, only a few have explicitly stated that the nature of war should not be understood as armed violence alone anymore. Rather, a common way to handle the paradox of defining war by armed violence and the increasing utility of nonmilitary means has been to introduce new concepts. Examples include nonmilitary war, wars of controlled chaos, unconventional warfare, information warfare, hybrid warfare, subversion-war, and wars of consciousness. Similarly, the adaptive approach to the use of force as proposed by Gerasimov (and relied on by others) sees the West's primary use\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
