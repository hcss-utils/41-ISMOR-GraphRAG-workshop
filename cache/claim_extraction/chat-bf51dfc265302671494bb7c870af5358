{"result": "## \n\n<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\nLet me explain why I couldn't provide any claims in this instance.  The provided text appears to be in Russian and consists primarily of citations and author names. To extract claims and entities effectively, I need clear sentences with subject-verb-object structures that express factual statements or assertions. The current text lacks this structure, making it difficult to identify:\n\n* **Entities:** While I can recognize some potential entities like \"\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043d,\" \"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432,\" and \"\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0438\u043d\" as persons, and \"\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\" as a possible organization,  the context is insufficient to confirm their types or roles.\n* **Claims:** The text presents titles of works and authors, not statements that can be classified as claims. \n\n**To improve the output, please provide the following:**\n\n1. **Full Text:**  The complete text document in English or with proper translation.\n2. **Contextual Information:** Any background knowledge about the document's topic or purpose. This will help me understand the meaning of the cited works and identify relevant entities and claims. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with a different text!", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.
