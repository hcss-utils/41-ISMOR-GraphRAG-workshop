Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

For Sergeyev, this was because up until the Serbian campaign, large-scale ground troops had been needed. The main driver for this revolution was seen to be the informatization of warfare and the use of highprecision weapons. He further argued that the \"main feature of the new stage of the revolution in military affairs is a sharp increase of the traditional weapons and the emergence of new types of conventional weapons\" (Sergeyev 1999, italics added) . This statement is particularly noteworthy because even if he perceived that a revolution in military affairs was ongoing, it was confined to traditional weapons or new conventional weapons. Furthermore, his usage of Slipchenko's concept and thoughts underlined the latter's influence.\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation was left in a vacuum without the Soviet ideology that had formed the knowledge system dealing with war and conflict. Marxism-Leninism was not only the methodological foundation for military strategy but also provided a whole worldview, which military strategy had to reflect.
