Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Shabardin 1987, 121) . While they included nonmilitary means in their concept of war, it is unclear if they thought that a confrontation with all means short of military could amount to war. In any case, the notion that war could be something more than strict violence had started to gain ascendance and now featured in the debates surrounding the nature of war. Meanwhile, formal definitions had a clear view of armed violence as the defining factor.\nIn both the Marxist-Leninist and Clausewitzian definitions, war is understood as an instrument of politics and specifically class politics in Marxist-Leninism. This is not an uncommon way to see war, but it could differ somewhat from the Western understanding. In the Soviet view, the underlying policy of a government remained, while it used peace or war as instruments to further its policy depending on circumstance (Vigor 1975, 8) .
