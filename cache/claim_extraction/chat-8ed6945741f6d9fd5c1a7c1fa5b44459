Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

His main focus was not on the threat of color revolutions, although he criticized foreign governments' support of democracy movements as an abuse of the concept of democracy. Rather, he criticized the United States and an uncontained \"hyper use of force\" in international relations (Putin 2007a) . He discussed foreign governments' support for NGOs in the questionsand-answers section, outlining that \"when these non-governmental organizations are financed by foreign governments, we see them as an instrument that foreign states use to carry out their Russian policies\" (Putin 2007a ). Putin concluded that the financing from foreign governments in the name of democracy was \"simply one state exerting influence on another\" (Putin 2007a ). Thus, he underlined the view of democracy promotion as a cover for foreign countries to pursue their interests, using NGOs as the means to that end.\nIn another interview, Putin added election monitors to the threat and asserted that Russia was a target. He saw that the decision by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to monitor the Russian elections as a result of pressure from the United States intended \"to disrupt the Russian elections and delegitimize its outcome\" (quoted in J.L. Wilson 2010, 25) . Thus, the Russian government made it so difficult for international monitors to work in Russia that they refused to try (\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
