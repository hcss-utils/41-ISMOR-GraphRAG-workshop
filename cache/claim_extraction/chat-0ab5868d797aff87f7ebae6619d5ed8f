Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, they are often contrarily seen by the Russian leadership as escalation, although by nonmilitary means. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, \"Russia believes itself to be in a war with the West, albeit, for now, a non-military one\" (Jonsson 2017a) . The inability to grasp the Russian leadership's understanding gives Western states a disadvantage both in negotiating potential solutions with Russia and deterring Russia, which is now the focus of NATO and the United States and is channeled through the European Reassurance Initiative and the European Deterrence Initiative with their budget of over $10 billion. Gauging the Russian understanding of war is thus crucial for handling the conflict with Russia, both in terms of how Russia will fight and how it will react to Western actions.\nThe most notable means accounting for this change in the Russian understanding of war is information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare, and the creation of color revolutions. Both of these are understood as nonviolent but are seen as so effective that they could amount to violence and blur the boundary between war and peace. Nonviolent color revolutions, largely depending on information warfare, are seen as the West's main approach to the use of force. In the view of Russian elites, the threat perception includes the content of information, which makes the understanding of information warfare very broad. This has led several key members of the elite, such as President Putin\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
