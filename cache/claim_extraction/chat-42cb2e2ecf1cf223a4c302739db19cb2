Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

He saw that the decision by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to monitor the Russian elections as a result of pressure from the United States intended \"to disrupt the Russian elections and delegitimize its outcome\" (quoted in J.L. Wilson 2010, 25) . Thus, the Russian government made it so difficult for international monitors to work in Russia that they refused to try (Finkel and Brudny 2012, 18) . This was part of a four-pronged approach to counter color revolutions; the other three were to regulate NGOs, channel youth activism toward support of the government, and manage elections (J.L. Wilson 2010, 22) .\nThe notion that NGOs were political weapons was echoed by Markov, who suggested in an interview that the NGO was the \"main political weapon\" in the twenty-first century and that \"in anticipation of the Russian federal election, financing of NGOs from the West has intensified\" (Romanov 2007) . This is interesting to read in parallel with Putin's yearly address to the Federal Assembly in April 2007, a week after Markov's interview: Some, making skillful use of pseudo-democratic rhetoric, would like to return us to the recent past, some in order to once again plunder the nation's resources with impunity and rob the people and the state, and others in order\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
