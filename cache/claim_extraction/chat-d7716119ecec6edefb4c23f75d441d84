Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

What Russian experts qualified as 'significant militarization of the informational domain' by the US, including new organisations, weapons and concepts, in particular that of cyber deterrence, stimulated a conceptual reaction. 43 Since strategic influence and not massive brute force is the essence of NGW, informational struggle emerges as an important tool of coercion. According to the GS experts, in contemporary warfare, deception, surprise and intimidation (coercion) produce effects beyond the tactical realm. Sophisticated means of informational influence may achieve strategic goals and downgrade determination to resist. 44 The term 'informational deterrence', as it features in the Russian discourse, refers to activities that shape the adversary's strategic calculus towards and during the hostilities. 45 It should incorporate digital-technological and cognitive-psychological forms of influence, by threat or by limited use of force against the adversary to attain its goals. 46 Ideally, effective informational struggle aimed at preventing and resolving conflicts should enable the attainment of political goals, without actually resorting to conventional, let alone nuclear, means of coercion, although their constant inclusion in the deterrence programme is required. 47 It is perceived as one of the most cost-effective coercion tools due to its\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
