Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Beyond the \"traditional\" military action seen in Afghanistan and Iraq, he saw that \"we are now seeing completely different approaches from Western countries, \" which included \"disseminating democratic values, the employment of non-military resources and the adaptive use of military force\" (Gerasimov 2014a, 15) . Of the two, the nonmilitary color revolution approach was the most important and was \"becoming the main means of achieving [Western] political ambitions\" (Gerasimov 2014a, 15) . He saw that the perpetrators of color revolutions thought of it as a nonviolent way to achieve regime change.\nThe methods of color revolutions were \"external manipulation of a population's potential for protest, combined with political, economic, humanitarian and other non-military measures\" (Gerasimov 2014a, 15) . \"During the past decade, \" Gerasimov continued, \"a wave of these 'color revolutions' has been instigated by the U.S. in the post-Soviet space, North Africa and the Middle East\" (Gerasimov 2014a, 15) . Initially, Gerasimov stated, the Arab Spring was seen as the victory of mostly nonviolent color revolutions. However, he found that color revolutions proved not to be \"an absolute means of political transformation\" but that they may degenerate to large-scale military action as in Libya and Syria (\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
