Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This neglect may delude Russian leaders about the effectiveness of cross-domain coercion as an effective tool against a range of challenges and place them on the brink of an apocalypse without their knowing it. 70 According to Andrei Kokoshin, Russian military theory has insufficiently 69 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 17. 70 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 20. elaborated the questions pertaining to 'the art of strategic gesture'demonstrations of nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities and resolve aimed at influencing an opponent's decision-making process. Contemporary Russian strategic theory 'lacks typology and classification of strategic gestures, and their arrangements according to the logic of the escalation ladder, which, under some circumstances, may evolve into a dangerous political-military crisis'. Russian political scientists hardly deal with these questions either. 71 Finally, there is a challenge of critical damage assessment. Although the 2014 military doctrine reconfirmed the first-use policy, until recently, it seems that Russian strategic planners lacked a codified procedure to estimate the conditions under which they would recommend to the senior leadership de-escalation by nuclear means. Russian experts argued until recently that they lacked methodology for calculating an unacceptable level of damage above which the nuclear threshold would be crossed. As of fall 2015, this critical threshold remained undefined. Russian military theoreticians demand the adoption of 'modified McNamara criteria' and the introduction of a procedure for the calculation of\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
