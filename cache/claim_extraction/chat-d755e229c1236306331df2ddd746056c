Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Rather, the doctrine did not mention any principles of no first use and that the nonuse of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states was valid only if they were a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and were not cooperating with a nuclear state (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 81) . This most likely reflected the loss of the Soviet Union's conventional superiority over the West (Fitzgerald 1994, 178) . Third, the doctrine did not identify the United States and NATO as the main sources of danger, although it did refer to the expansion of military blocs and alliances as detrimental to Russian military security (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1). The 1993 doctrine was optimistic in regard to international security and military dangers, focusing on problems of internal social and economic character, which could be seen as a result of the internal turmoil Russia was going through at the time, with an economic downturn and Chechnya being de facto independent.\nThe 1993 Military Doctrine had a clear focus on conventional military means. This included a priority for Russia to develop command, control, and communications (C 3 ) systems and precision weapons (Fitzgerald 1994, 17) . American analyst Mary Fitzgerald (1994) concluded that there was a strong civilian-military consensus on these requirements.
