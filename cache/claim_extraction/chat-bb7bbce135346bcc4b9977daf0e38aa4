Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

More specifically, Popov claimed that the use of radical organizations and involvement of the protest potential of the population has become typical indirect action for the leading nations of the world (RIA Novosti 2014a). Therefore, the Military Doctrine was updated after only four years.\nThe 2014 doctrine followed the main strands set out in 2010, including the divisions of military and armed conflict and local, regional, and large-scale war. Nonetheless, there were a number of areas where the new doctrine went further. The first was that the doctrine painted a more negative image of international relations. Similar to the Foreign Policy Concept, the 2014 doctrine saw that global competition was on the rise, including rivalry within values and models of developments, whereas the 2010 doctrine stated that ideological confrontation was weakening (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.7, 9; 2014, point II.9).\nAnother novelty was the need for a nonnuclear deterrence. Among the core tasks for the armed forces was, the doctrine stated, \"to have strategic deterrence (nuclear and non-nuclear) and therefore stop military conflicts\" (Ministry of Defense 2014, point II.32:B).
