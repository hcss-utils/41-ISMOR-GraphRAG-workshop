Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Because it believed the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 were organized on social media, the leadership increased restrictions and created its own organization (the Internet Research Agency) to combat grassroots dissent internationally. To be clear, this is not to make a justification for Russian information operations-simply to give the context in which they evolved.\nThe importance of information warfare, and particularly informationpsychological warfare, has become reflected among Russian military theorists and doctrines. For instance, the 2010 Military Doctrine stated that information warfare could achieve political objectives without the use of force. The 2011 Conceptual Views saw it as the armed forces' task to counter information interference in internal affairs. There has also been a notable shift among military theorists to see information-psychological as more important than armed force rather than a complement to it (e.g., Chekinov and Bogdanov; Gerasimov, Kartapolov, and Burenok) . It would not be an exaggeration to state that there has been a militarization of information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare. Furthermore, information-psychological warfare is intrinsically linked to color revolutions by its potential to destabilize the state, society, and public consciousness as well as patriotic and spiritual values.\nThe question is thus whether the increasing utility of informationpsychological warfare is causing a change in the Russian understanding\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
