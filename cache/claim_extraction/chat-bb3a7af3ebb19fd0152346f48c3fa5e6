Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

He argued that Russia could not itself introduce a new concept of war, which needed to be done multilaterally. However, this is not a fully persuasive argument. It would seem he was reaching for a legal/practical way to avoid what he reasoned theoretically. That is to say, if the progress of technology and society has allowed nonmilitary means to be seen as violent, then there is a case for including them in the concept of war if war is defined by violence.\nGareyev followed up the same train of thought in a 2016 article. He stated that \"war itself was understood primarily as a continuation of politics by means of armed violence, \" even though \"nonmilitary forms of confrontation were widely used\" (Gareyev 2016) . This was also the understanding of war reflected in the federal law On Defense (Gareyev 2016) . Nonetheless, while addressing the ongoing debate on whether the use of nonmilitary means could equal war, Gareyev stated that \"the definition of the essence of war must, to some extent, be reviewed\" (Gareyev 2016) . However, such laws and concepts could not, according to Gareyev, be done by each state by itself but required discussion by the UN (Gareyev 2016) . For clarification, Gareyev stated that \"the threat is connected with information and other subvers\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
