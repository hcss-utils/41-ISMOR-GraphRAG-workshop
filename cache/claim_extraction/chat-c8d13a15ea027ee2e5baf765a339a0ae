Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for \"the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives\" (Kennan 1948) . This emphasizes the problem at the center of the term. As argued by Hoffman, \"If all wars are political in their purpose (as the famous Prussian soldier-scholar Carl von Clausewitz insisted), \" and if war is defined by violence, then \"there is no warfare in these political and economic activities, which is why the term is an oxymoron\" (Hoffman 2014) .\nIndeed, in a follow-up book, Galeotti addressed the contradictions in the Russian debate and the criticism of the term \"political war. \" First, he correctly noted that \"time and time again, military writers flirted with the notion of war without open fighting\" (Galeotti 2019, 30) . Galeotti then argued that Russians \"believe that the nature of war is changing, and in ways which mean the use of direct force may not always or initially be a central element to the conflict\" (Galeotti 2019, 30) . As it comes to the criticism of political war, Galeotti stated that the alternative would be to call it\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
