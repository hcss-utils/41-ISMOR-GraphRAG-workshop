Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

For this reason, Gulin argued, war should not be understood mainly in terms of armed struggle but rather by the consistent features of the uncompromising struggle (Gulin 1997, 51) . The interesting part about Gulin's argument is that he solved the question of what war is by expanding the definition of violence. For him, forms of warfare that are not violent in the physical sense (e.g., social violence) could still amount to war.\nDefense Minister Igor Sergeyev wrote an article in 1999 outlining the Russian military-technical policy for the twenty-first century. The threats were, unsurprisingly, coherent with those of the forthcoming Military Doctrine from 2000 (discussed below), but the article also stated that a \"new generation of weapons amounts to a qualitatively new phase of the arms race and a significant change in the content, forms, and methods of warfare\" (Sergeyev 1999) . Drawing on Slipchenko's terminology, Sergeyev saw that the bombing of Serbia had become a full-scale prototype of noncontact warfare, which then led to the first stage of an RMA. For Sergeyev, this was because up until the Serbian campaign, large-scale ground troops had been needed. The main driver for this revolution was seen to be the informatization of warfare and the use of highprecision weapons. He further argued that the \"main feature of the new stage of the revolution in military affairs is a sharp\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
