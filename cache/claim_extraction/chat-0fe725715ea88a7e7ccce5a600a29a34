Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

On December 23, 2004three days before the rerun of the second round of voting in the Ukrainian presidential elections, in which Viktor Yushchenko was elected president-Putin held his end-of-year press conference. In it, he criticized the double standards of the United States and the EU in propagating democracy and human rights but not supporting the Serbs in Kosovo, the Albanians in Macedonia, or the ethnic Russians in Latvia (Putin 2004 ). Putin criticized the promotion of democracy by the US and EU as selective and instrumental, but he did not accuse them of creating the revolution. However, he stated that \"the most dangerous [thing] . . . is the creation of a system of permanent revolutions\" (Putin 2004) .\nThree weeks later, on January 13, 2005, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov also criticized the West for double standards in its Ukrainian policy.\nIn his view, the Western nations had stated that they would acknowledge the election only if \"their\" candidate won. Ivanov felt that \"in regard to a sovereign state . . . [such statements] are fraught with the most grave consequences.
