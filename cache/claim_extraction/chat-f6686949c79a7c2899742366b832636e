Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

This paradox (the necessity of peace / the inevitability of war) was found not only in ideology but also among policymakers (Light 1988, 209) .\nThe understanding of war as inevitable was maintained from the formation of the Soviet Union until Nikita Khrushchev amended it several years after the Soviet Union's first successful test of an explosive nuclear device: \"There is, of course, a Marxist-Leninist precept that wars are inevitable as long as imperialism exists . . . but war is not fatalistically inevitable. Today there are mighty social and political forces possessing formidable means to prevent the imperialists from unleashing war\" (Khrushchev, cited in Booth 1981, 84-85, italics added; see also Burin 1963) .\nThe \"formidable means\" that Khrushchev referred to were, of course, nuclear weapons. This view concomitantly entered Marksizm-Leninism o voine i armii as \"wars are no fatal inevitability in human social development\" (Byely et al. 1972, 5) . This led to a reconsideration of the view that the transformation to socialism absolutely necessitated armed struggle; rather, \"the only condition necessary for the transition from capitalism to socialism is the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat\" (Lider 1977, 233) .
