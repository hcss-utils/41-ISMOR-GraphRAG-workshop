Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

A key instrument for ensuring the party influence over the military apparatus was the Administrative Organs Department, which controlled all the appointments of military and security personnel (Dziak 1981, 41-42) . Another instrument was the Military-Political Administration, which dispensed party patronage and controlled all the military messages to external and internal audiences, such as books and the journals Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) and Voyennaya Mysl (Military Thought) (Dziak 1981, 10, 34-35) .\nAdditionally, the military was controlled covertly by way of informant networks of the KGB's Third Chief Directorate (Dziak 1981, 11) .\nAfter the advent of nuclear weapons, there was discussion as to whether war could still be considered an instrument of politics or if it would lead to the annihilation of humanity (and thus fail to further political goals). There were Soviet voices, mainly civilian, that argued that war had ceased to be an instrument of policy (Nikolsky 1964; Talensky 1965; Garthoff 1992, 58) . However, Sokolovsky refuted these claims at length in Voyennaya Strategiya (Military Strategy, Sokolovsky 1963, 98-99) .
