Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

The most significant change in the doctrine was the changed wording regarding the use of nuclear weapons. The 1997 concept stated that they could be used in the case of an existential threat, whereas the 2000 concept stated that all means, including nuclear, would be used against an armed aggressor (Main 2000) .\nSeven years after the first Military Doctrine, another was adopted. The new doctrine maintained some of the optimism of the former by, for instance, stating that positive changes in the international situation, the peace-loving foreign-policy course of Russia, and its nuclear deterrent capability had decreased the threat of direct military aggression against Russia (Ministry of Defense 2000, point I.4). In terms of the view of war, the 2000 Military Doctrine was less clear. It continued, like the 1993 doctrine, to explain war with armed conflict in parentheses. It noted that \"the nature of modern wars and armed conflicts is determined by their military-political goals, the means of achieving these goals, and the scale of military operations\" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.2).\nIn the paragraph describing modern wars, the doctrine reads\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
