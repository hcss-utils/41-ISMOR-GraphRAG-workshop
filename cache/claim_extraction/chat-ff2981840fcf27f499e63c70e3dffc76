Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Svechin argued, along with Lenin and Clausewitz, that politics are necessarily superior to strategy; Tukhachevsky argued that strategy should be protected from interference from policymakers. For Svechin, \"it is natural for strategy to try to gain emancipation from bad politics, but strategy cannot exist in a vacuum without politics and is condemned to for all the sins of politics\" (Svechin 1927, 85) . In the end, Svechin's view prevailed on this question.\nThe notion of political supremacy took even stronger hold during the totalitarian period under Stalin and the personality cult. Stalin dominated all Soviet strategic thought due to his control of both the Communist Party and the military apparatus (Scott and Scott 1988, 74) . The supremacy of the political side, personified by Stalin, was further cemented by the purges of the 1930s. They not only removed a majority of senior officers but also led to, in Kokoshin's words, \"numerous Russian and Soviet military and political-military thinkers [being] for many years totally excluded from Soviet intellectual life\" (Kokoshin 1998, 8) . The purges also halted discussions and development in militarypolitical affairs. There was paralyzing fear among the remaining military leaders of taking the initiative and making independent decisions, thus hind\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
