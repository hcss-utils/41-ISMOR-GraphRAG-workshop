Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Putin then stated that mutual US-Russia understanding was not helped \"by regular US attempts to engage in 'political engineering, ' including in regions that are traditionally important to us and during Russian elections\" (Putin 2012c) . It is noteworthy that Putin equated soft power with the outbreak of color revolutions.\nThe Euromaidan protests and the fall of Yanukovych increased the significance of the color revolutions. Putin saw the protests as another achievement of \"controlled 'color' revolutions\" (Putin 2014a ). After the annexation of Crimea, Putin stated that the people's \"feelings were taken advantage of cynically. Standards were imposed on these nations that did not in any way correspond to their way of life, traditions or these people's cultures\" (Putin 2014a ). Furthermore, he argued that \"our Western partners have crossed the line\" (Putin 2014a ). Thus, he emphasized the color revolutions as a pattern and foreign values as part of color revolutions. On another occasion, he equated color revolutions with extremism, arguing that \"in the modern world extremism is being used as a geopolitical instrument for remaking spheres of influence.
