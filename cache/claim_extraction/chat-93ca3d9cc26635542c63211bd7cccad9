Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This is interesting in conjunction with the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) in Serbia, which received funding from Western NGOs and trained opposition activists in Georgia and Ukraine (Jones 2006, 40) . Surkov, like Putin, did not directly attribute the color revolutions to Western states but rather foreign NGOs. A month later, Putin stated that financing of political activity from abroad was to be forbidden, a reaction that an editorial in the Russian newspaper Vedemosti labeled \"Maidanophobia\" (Vedemosti 2005) . The sense of threat was shared by the population; in July 2005, 42 percent thought that an event similar to those in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan could happen in Russia (Gazeta 2005) .\nIn September 2005, Putin stated at a press conference before the EU-Russia summit that he did not see that the United States or the EU were working against Russia. However, he also said he knew that \"certain non-governmental organisations in Ukraine were financed by foreign governments\" (Steele 2005) .
