{"result": "<|COMPLETE|> \n\n\nLet me explain why I can't provide the output you're looking for with the given text.\n\nThe provided text appears to be a list of citations or references from academic publications.  It lacks the narrative structure and explicit claims needed to fulfill the task. \n\nTo generate the type of output you described, I would need text that:\n\n* **Presents factual statements or assertions:**  The text should contain sentences that make claims about entities (organizations, people, locations, events) rather than just listing references.\n* **Clearly identifies subjects and objects of claims:** The text needs to explicitly state who or what is performing an action and who or what is being affected by the action. \n* **Includes dates or timeframes:** For claims to have a \"claim date,\" the text must provide information about when the claim was made or when the event described in the claim occurred.\n\n**Example of suitable text:**\n\n\"In 2018, Company X (organization) was accused by Government Agency Y (organization) of engaging in illegal lobbying practices. The accusations were based on leaked emails that revealed secret meetings between executives from Company X and government officials.\"\n\n\nLet me know if you have a different text sample that meets these criteria, and I'll be happy to help you extract the claims! \n", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.
