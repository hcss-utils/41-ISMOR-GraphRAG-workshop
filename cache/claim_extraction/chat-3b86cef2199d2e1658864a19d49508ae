Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

To support this, he referred to the only time when nuclear weapons have been used, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki; both cases made it clear that they served US policy (Gareyev 1998, 20) . This brought Gareyev into line with the Clausewitzian and Soviet distinction of how the nature of war remains, while its character shifts. Another area of continuity with Soviet understanding in Gareyev's thinking is the causes of war, which he saw as economic, even if they were \"disguised as religious, ideological, and other motives\" (Gareyev 1998, 19) . The causes of wars, Gareyev argued, were \"the struggle for territorial gains, natural resources, wealth and manpower (slaves); attempts by conquerors to subdue other nations or even establish world domination; the seizure of colonies, and their expansion, raw materials and spheres of economic and political influence\" (Gareyev 1998, 22) .\nFurthermore, Gareyev contended that the main source of conflict in the near future will be the struggle for raw materials and survival (Gareyev 1998, 26) . He insisted on the importance of enduring concepts in Russian military theory,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
