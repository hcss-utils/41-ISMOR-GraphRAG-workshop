Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

The aim was claimed to be the elimination of the potential for Western-sponsored uprisings\" (Saari 2009, 743-44) .\nAt the same time, the Russian government created the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, which was supposed to be a consultative platform for civil society to analyze draft legislation and provide oversight. However, the selection process was rigged, and the chamber was filled by pro-Kremlin activists (Greene 2014, 87) . The Civic Chamber was another way to counter the fear of opposition NGOs to give the impression that NGOs already had an influence on politics.\nIn discussing the potential of color revolutions, Vladimir Frolov, a political analyst, argued that Russia was facing a fundamentally new phenomenon in the post-Soviet space. In an article titled \"Democracy by Remote Control, \" he argued that elections in the CIS \"turned into a convenient pretext for outside multilateral interference\" (Frolov 2005) . Frolov saw that the outside factors consisted of a combination of Western NGOs, mass media, election observation missions, and Western countries' political leadership (Frolov 2005) . He argued that they succeeded in managing election results by declaring which ones were legitimate and which were not, acting as a \"political and legal instrument for regime change\"\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
