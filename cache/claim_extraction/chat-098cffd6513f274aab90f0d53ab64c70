Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B. The company is owned by Person C who was suspected of engaging in corruption activities in 2015.\nOutput:\n\n(COMPANY A<|>GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Company A was found to engage in anti-competitive practices because it was fined for bid rigging in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B according to an article published on 2022/01/10<|>According to an article published on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample 2:\nEntity specification: Company A, Person C\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

How does it diverge from previous Russian practice? The main novelty is that in essence, this approach is not a brute force but a coercion strategy. In contrast to traditional massive use of force, cross-domain coercion aims at manipulating the adversary's perception, decision-making and behaviour. This notion lies at the heart of NGW, which orchestrates the military and non-military measures while minimising kinetic engagements. Since Russian usage of the term 'deterrence' equally refers to the prevention of the threat from materialising, to deterrence in peacetime and to the use of force in crisis and in wartime, it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion aimed at shaping the battlefield dynamic. The quest to shape the strategic environment, whether in an active or reactive mode, is a departure from the big war paradigm that dominated Russian military thought for decades. This is not to say that Moscow has stopped massive operations maximising violence, but the choice to address threats mainly by coercively shaping the environment across domains to evaporate them is somewhat novel for the Russian military.\nSince NGW is less about traditional military destruction but rather targets the adversary's perception to affect its will and choices, the role of the informational domain looms unprecedentedly large. Its addition to the traditional domains 54 is a second novelty. Informational strike epitomises the logic Gerasimov's doctrine being a strategy of breaking up the internal coherence of the enemy system\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
