Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

He found that \"a recent search on open-source data indicated that NGW has almost completely disappeared from Russian military literature. There were zero hits on the topic over the past 1500 days\" (Thomas 2017, 143) . Therefore, it seems that the concept of NGW gathered momentum for being an accessible and interesting concept that described the Russian modus operandi in Ukraine rather than for its role of influencing Russian military thought.\nAs the concept of hybrid warfare started to fall out of favor, the Gerasimov doctrine gained popularity. This refers to the thoughts Valery Gerasimov expressed in a 2013 speech, but the term was first used by Galeotti-something he came to regret. In an undated update to his article, he added \"I was just going for a snappy title. I really didn't expect (or want) it to become a more generally used term\" (Galeotti 2014 ; see also Galeotti 2018b) . He continued to argue that if it was anyone's doctrine, it was Nikolai Makarov's but that the article should rather be seen as an observation about war in the twenty-first century rather than a Russian doctrine (Galeotti 2014) . Nonetheless, the concept had already acquired a life of its own among US and European practitioners and theorists (e.g., see Lalu \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
