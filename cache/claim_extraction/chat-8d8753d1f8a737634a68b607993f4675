Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Rather, its definition then would have to expand and thus lead to a change in the nature of war. Information warfare is not just changing the understanding of war in isolation-it is also seen as an integral component in the creation of color revolutions, which have become the main threat for the Russian leadership. This will be investigated in the next chapter.\nChAPTer 4\nIt was this fear of \"regime change\" and a \"color revolution\" that prompted the Putin regime to go to war [in Ukraine].\n-Heidi Reisinger and Aleksandr Golts (2015, 114) T he threat of revolutions has long been present in the minds of Russian leaders, but it took until the early 2010s for them to take center stage in terms of the threat perception and understanding of war among Russian elites and military theorists. This shift started with a series of nonviolent uprisings in the former Soviet Union from 2003 to 2005 known as the color revolutions. 1 In Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, the opposition succeeded with nonviolent protest tactics, the training for which was often financially supported by Western organizations and/or governments (Mitchell 2012; Spoerri 2008, 81; Beach\u00e1in and Polese 2010, 37; Beissinger 2007, 261) .
