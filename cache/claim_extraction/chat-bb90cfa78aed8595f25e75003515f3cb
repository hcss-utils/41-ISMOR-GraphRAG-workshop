Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Of course targets may, and likely will, include those that have both a deterrent effect and practical military value should the conflict continue; that is, there are targets which may be considered dual purpose.\nMilitary writings generally divide targets based on their strategic significance and collateral effects. For example, \"vitally important objects\" are understood to be targets the damage to which leads to significant economic losses and population loss (such as hazardous industries, hydrocarbon facilities, and hydro and nuclear power plants). 180 These targets could be engaged, or threatened, for the purposes of intimidation (fear inducement) to convince an adversary of the unacceptable costs of continuing a conflict with Russia. 181 In contrast to vitally important targets, \"targets of significant value\" are military-economic targets the damage to which can create significant economic losses, affecting the livelihood of the population and military command and control, but which will not lead to a significant loss of life (these include satellite systems, power stations, electrical substations, and others). 182 180 \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a, \"\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\"; \u0420\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044c\u043a\u043e, \"\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\"; \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u043d, \"\u041e \u0432\u044b\u0431\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
