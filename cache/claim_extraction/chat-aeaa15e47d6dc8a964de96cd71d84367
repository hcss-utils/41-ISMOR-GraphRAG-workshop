Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

He restated his view from 2014 that color revolutions were the main means for foreign powers to pursue their interests. He also made an explicit connection between the protest potential of the population (which the Military Doctrine mentions frequently) and color revolutions (which the doctrine does not mention). It is also notable that the term \"hybrid warfare\" had entered the Russian discussion after its popularity in the West (e.g., see Kartapolov 2015 and Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016 ; see chapter 1). Last, Gerasimov's statement that \"information resources have become one of the most effective weapons\" is a consequential one and notable in relation to whether information should be seen as violent or not.\nA study in the use of different concepts, with a focus on hybrid warfare, was done by Igor Nikolaychuk, head of the regional security center at RISS. He saw that hybrid wars included a number of different themes, such as \"the use of chaos theory . . . , controlled chaos in international politics, the activities to change political regimes in different countries, and the preparation and implementation of 'color revolutions'\" (Nikolaychuk 2016, 88) . Nikolaychuk measured how many times different versions of war were mentioned on RUNET (the Russophone Internet) in the period 2007-15.
