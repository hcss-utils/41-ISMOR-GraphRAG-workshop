Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Nonetheless, the bulk of the work of the 2010 doctrine was done in 2005-7. Thus, it did not fully reflect the New Look reforms, which began in earnest in 2009, following the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008.\nIn the 2013 Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, the main strands of thought remained from the Foreign Policy Concept of 2008, such as the view of NATO, Russia's role as a great power, regional priorities, and the importance of the UN Security Council as the main locus for ensuring international security. However, the 2013 concept was more explicit on security policy and the understanding of war. Under the heading \"Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation in the Modern World, \" the concept argued that \"efforts to build up or modernize offensive potentials, to create and deploy new types of weapons erode the global security architecture\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2013, point II.7). The concept saw that \"economic, legal, scientific, environmental, demographic and IT factors become as important for states in influencing the world politics as the military power\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2013, point II.10).\nThe concept stated that \"some concepts that are being implemented are aimed at overthrowing legitimate authorities in sovereign states under the pretext of protecting the\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
