Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

An important exception was those Western theorists already analyzing Russian information warfare since 1996 (see Thomas 1996 Thomas , 1998 Thomas , 2001 Thomas , 2003 Thomas , 2009 Thomas , 2014;; Blank 1999 Blank , 2008a Blank , 2013;; Heicker\u00f6 2010; Giles 2012b Giles , 2014;; Giles and Hagestad 2013) .\nWhen Putin was reelected and returned to the presidency in 2012, relations with the West turned worse, and interest in Russia increased again. After the war in Ukraine began, a more focused debate on Russian warfare and the Russian understanding of modern war came to fruition (see, e.g., Allison 2014; Wilson 2014; Tsygankov 2015; Charap and Colton 2016; Westerlund and Norberg 2016; Kofman et al. 2017; Bowen 2017) . However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) .
