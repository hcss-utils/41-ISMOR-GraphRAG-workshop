Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The difference in values is an integral part of this, wherein Russia sees the need both to internally strengthen the support for its own model and spiritual renewal and to isolate foreign actors' abilities to influence it. The 2000 Information Security Doctrine explicitly formulated unsuccessful government control of the media as a threat. This securitization is the background against which both traditional and social media came under governmental, or government-friendly, control.\nThe imminent sense of threat among the Russian leaders has also been an essential part of the Russian conduct of information warfare. Because it perceived it lost the First Chechen War due to a lack of morale, which came from open traditional media and the free movement of journalists in the conflict zone, the leadership restricted broadcasting and used loyal journalists in the Second Chechen War. Because Russia felt it lost the global information battle in the war in Georgia, it significantly increased Sputnik (a government-run international news agency) and RT's international operations. Because it believed the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 were organized on social media, the leadership increased restrictions and created its own organization (the Internet Research Agency) to combat grassroots dissent internationally. To be clear, this is not to make a justification for Russian information operations-simply to give the context in which they evolved.\nThe importance of information warfare, and particularly information\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
