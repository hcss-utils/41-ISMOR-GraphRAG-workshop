Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Although the strategy was not explicit about what kind of support the United States and the EU were thought to have given to Ukraine that led to war, it was a clear accusation. The doctrine also put a frequent emphasis on spiritual-moral values that was notably stronger than in the 2009 version (Oliker 2016) .\nThis investigation of the Russian understanding of war confirms that it has broadened and widened in the post-Soviet era. In the 1990s, there was a large degree of continuity with the late-Soviet view of armed force as the defining factor of war. In the late 1990s and mid-2000s, some voices argued for an expansion of the understanding of war because of the increasing importance of nonmilitary means. However, these voices did not receive a lot of mainstream traction, and the authoritative views of war still clearly focused on military violence as the defining factor. Nonetheless, many of the key notions that were later incorporated into mainstream military theory first appeared then, such as the blurring boundary between war and peace, nonmilitary means being violent, information being a weapon, and nonmilitary means being more effective than military means and sufficient in and of themselves to achieve strategic outcomes. This underlines the long-term evolution of Russian\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
