Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The annexation of Crimea in 2014, the creation and command of insurgencies in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine, and the information warfare and subversion to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election are the best-known examples. However, beyond that, Russia has pursued a wide range of provocative military actions and nonmilitary and subversive measures against European states and states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union in order to forward its national interests. Consequently, the 2018 US National Defense Strategy reelevated the threat from Russia and identified long-term strategic competition with Russia and China as the central challenges to US security (US Department of Defense 2018). Similarly, the UK Defence Committee concluded in its report after the illegal annexation of Crimea that the Russian use of asymmetrical warfare \"represents the most immediate threat to its NATO neighbours and other NATO Member States\" (UK Defence Committee 2014).\nIn the Western debate about Russian warfare, analysts have discussed concepts such as \"hybrid warfare, \" \"new-generation warfare, \" and the \"Gerasimov doctrine\" to describe Russia's pursuit of its political goals using the full spectrum of military and nonmilitary forms of conflict. The main novelty for Western analysts\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
