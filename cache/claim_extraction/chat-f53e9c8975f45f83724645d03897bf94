Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Hoffman defined an enemy who uses hybrid threats as \"any adversary that simultaneously employs a tailored mix of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, terrorism, and criminal behavior in the same time and battlespace to obtain their political objectives\" (Hoffman 2014 ; see also Hoffman 2007 Hoffman , 2009 Hoffman , 2010)) . This definition explicitly refers to synchronicity in time and space on the operational level, which makes the definition narrow. Hoffman also pointed out that the definition excludes nonmilitary means, such as economic, information, and subversive political acts, except when they are associated with terrorist and irregular tactics (Hoffman 2014 ). 3 This way of defining hybrid warfare is therefore narrow enough to be analytically useful for the military's operational analysis, but it does not capture the key elements of what made Russian warfare successful in Ukraine, nor was it meant to.\nTo dispel the definitional confusion, Mark Galeotti usefully argued that the debate deals with two parallel, yet overlapping, phenomena: \"One is true 'hybrid war, ' the other perhaps best considered 'political war'\" (Galeotti 2016a, 7 ; see also Galeotti 2016b Galeotti , 2019)) . In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
