It discusses concepts like \"hybrid warfare\" (HW) and how Western analysis might misinterpret Russian military strategy.  There aren't clear-cut statements that directly assert facts about entities or actions in the way needed for claim extraction.\n* **Subjectivity:** Many statements in the text are opinions or interpretations (\"Experts have already spotted this mistake...,\" \"Western experts have been utilising the term HW...\"). To generate claims, we need verifiable statements, not subjective assessments. \n\n**To improve the output, you would need a text that contains:**\n\n* **Explicit Claims:**  Statements that directly assert something about an entity or event (e.g., \"Company A bribed government officials,\" \"Person B won the election\").\n* **Factual Basis:**  Claims should be supported by evidence or references within the text.\n\n\nLet me know if you have a different text with more explicit claims \u2013 I'm ready to help analyze it! \n", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

The rising importance of pressing adversaries by non-military means results in a multidimensional merger of soft and hard power, operating non-military activities in conjunction with military (conventional and non-conventional), covert and overt operations, special forces, mercenaries and internal opposition to achieve strategic outcomes.\nThe inaccuracy in qualifying the Russian approach as innovative also relates to the issue of terminology. Applying a Western conceptual framework to explain a foreign operational art, divorcing it from its foreign ideational context and from what the foreigners say to themselves may lead to misperceptions. Utilising the term HW, which dominates the professional discourse in analysing the Russian concept of 'NGW', seems to be a misrepresentation. Experts have already spotted this mistake of imposing a Western way of thinking on the Russian operational art. 59 This mirror imaging may attribute non-existent qualities of the Russian approach and overlook its essentials.\nWith few exceptions, 60 Western experts have been utilising the term HW to describe current Russian strategic theory and practice. Russian sources, however, do not define their approach as HW and use this term to refer to the Western way of war, which they are trying to counteract. Until recently, HW was not at all part of the Russian official lexicon. Before the 2014 events in Ukraine, the term featured in the professional discourse either in reference to US threat perception or to categorise one of the recent trends in the US's waging of war. 61 Since 2014\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
