Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The information component and high-precision weapons were the two pillars of noncontact warfare (Slipchenko 2002b) . On this topic, Slipchenko also mentioned the massive global psychological offensive waged by the United States after 9/11 to support its war aims (Slipchenko 2005, 45) . This arguably implied the building of international support and UN approval for the subsequent operations in Afghanistan.\nSlipchenko anticipated radical change in the conduct of war. He even suggested that Russia needed \"armed forces made up of two functional types: strategic-strike and strategic-defense forces\" (Slipchenko 2005, 27) . Nonetheless, he does not take a revolutionary position relating to the nature of war. Even with all the changes he saw in the character of war, he still adhered to the view that it was military force that defined war and that in sixth-generation warfare the range of precision strikes enabled military force to be unleashed from anywhere in the world (Slipchenko 2005, 26) .\nAlthough a major innovation of Slipchenko's thought was his view that \"information had become a destructive weapon just like a bayonet, bullet or projectile\" (Slipchenko 2005, 33) , while considering the nature of war to be constant, he suggested adding a component that\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
