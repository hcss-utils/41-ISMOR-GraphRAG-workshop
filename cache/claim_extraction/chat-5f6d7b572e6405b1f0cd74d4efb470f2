Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

He insisted on the importance of enduring concepts in Russian military theory, such as moral superiority, technology only as a multiplier and not a substitute for manpower, and doctrine as leading the development of technology (Bukkvoll 2011, 687) . The core of Gareyev's argument was that regardless of the benefits technology can bring, strength of will and morale are decisive. That said, he was not a reactionary. For instance, when describing the main ways to combat an enemy, he argued that \"the main efforts in the struggle with the enemy will be directed not towards the physical destruction of each unit of weaponry, but towards the destruction of their common information space, sources of intelligence, channels of navigation, and control systems of communication and targeting in general\" (Gareyev 1998, 49 ; see also Kipp 1998, 10-12) .\nThe second significant military theorist in the 1990s was Maj.
