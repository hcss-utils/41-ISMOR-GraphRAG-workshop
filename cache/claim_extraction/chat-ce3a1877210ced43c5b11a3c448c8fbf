Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It held a traditional view on the military threats that faced the Russian Federation, including existing and potential hotbeds of local wars and armed conflict close to Russia's borders, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the threat from international terrorism (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1993).\nThe National Security Concept differed from the Military Doctrine in some ways. It started by noting that the danger of direct aggression against the Russian Federation was virtually absent due to the strengthening of international law (President of the Russian Federation 1997, points I, III). The main military threat was seen to be local wars on Russia's borders, followed by threats of an internal nature (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III). It stipulated that Russia had an opportunity to solve internal problems, such as terrorism, the economy, and ethnonational struggles (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III). Thus, military means were seen to be decreasing in their importance relative to other means. The focus on terrorism and ethnonational struggles also had an understandable explanation. The doctrine was published just after the cease-fire of the First Chechen War in 1996, when Russia was left de facto without control of its territory and the Chechen side morphed from nationalist separatism toward jihadism and terrorism (Hughes 2008) .
