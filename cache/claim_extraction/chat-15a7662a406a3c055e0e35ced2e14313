Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

(Lenin 1915, 219) This became the foundation for defining war in the Soviet Union. It is important to note that Lenin himself added \"violent\" and did not use Clausewitz's formal definition that \"war is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do your will\" (Clausewitz 1991, 29) . Furthermore, Lenin also expanded Clausewitz's definition in ways not intended by him and criticized Clausewitz for treating policy as the foreign policy interests of a unitary state. Rather, for Lenin, \"war is a reflection of the internal policy conducted by the given country before the war\" (Lenin 1919, 152) . In this way, Lenin was criticizing both Clausewitz and Hegel, who viewed the state as in an \"impartial position above the struggle of particular interests in society\" (Gat 1992, 372) .\nLike Lenin, Trotsky also saw violence as the defining feature of war. In a discussion at the Military Science Society, he stated that even though \"the artificial milieu, or human technology, in the broad sense of the word, has transfigured war just as it has transfigured all other human relations . . . this most general basis [of war] remains unchanged.
