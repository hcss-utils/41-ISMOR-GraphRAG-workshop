Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Since 2011, there has been a trend toward discussing integrated employment of conventional and nuclear precision strike systems in an operational context. In a recent article in the journal Military Thought, for example, analysts from the 27 TsNII described the current components of Russia's \"strategic deterrence\" system as potentially trending toward the following state of operational integration:\n\uf0b7 \"Strategic nuclear forces (SNF) with the support of nonstrategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) and strategic conventional weapons provide global nuclear deterrence based on the effective retaliatory potential of strategic nuclear forces in any conditions of the strategic environment.\n\uf0b7 \"Nuclear weapons (SNF and NSNW) working together with strategic conventional weapons play the role of deterrence, de-escalation, and curb of large [regional] nonnuclear threats, including those from a coalition.\n\uf0b7 \"Strategic conventional weapons complement the nuclear deterrence mechanism, contribute to the achievement of goals of [thwarting] local nonnuclear threats to military security and support the impossibility of a [downward] crawl of the nuclear threshold into the sphere of local wars and armed conflicts.\"177 \nThe prospective strategic operation of strategic deterrence forces, noted above, is a prime example of potential conventional-nuclear integration.
