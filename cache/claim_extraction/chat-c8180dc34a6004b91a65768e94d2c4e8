Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As the cost of such can be vast, grasping Russia's understanding of war is thus crucial for international and regional security and is something this book seeks to provide.\nHas the Russian understanding of the nature of war changed? Answering this question is the primary goal of this book. Other studies have analyzed the Russian military thought but not directly engaged in whether or not the nature of war is changing. In answering this question, I will map the development of Russian military thought from the creation of the Soviet Union until today.\nThis book relies on a distinction between the nature of war and the character of war. This was a distinction originally proposed by the general and philosopher Carl von Clausewitz in On War, but it was brought into Soviet military theory by Vladimir Lenin (see chapter 1) and has persisted since then in Russian military thought (see chapter 2). The distinction of character versus nature of war is critical because a change in character is constant as technology and societies change, whereas Clausewitz and others have seen that the nature of war is unchanging. As explained by the Russian theorist Pavel Kazarin, the nature of war refers to the properties or traits that war has, and the character refers to the content (Kazarin 2002, 18) . Thus, a change in the nature of war would\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
