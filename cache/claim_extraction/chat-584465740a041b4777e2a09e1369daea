Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

For an overview of the origins of hybrid warfare, see Fridman 2018. 3 . The concept of hybrid warfare was also used by a wide variety of senior US political and military leaders, including Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, Undersecretary of State Joseph Nye Jr., Undersecretary of Defense Mich\u00e8le Flournoy. See the summary in Hoffman 2018, 37. 4. For instance, Aleksandr Bartosh, whom Fridman quotes, saw violence as the factor distinguishing hybrid warfare (violent) from color revolutions (nonviolent) (Bartosh 2015) . 5. This might not be fully accurate, though, as leading Western theorists have also given strong emphasis to information warfare. Two examples include Mattis and Hoffman's argument of the four-block war, where the fourth is psychological and information operations (Mattis and Hoffman 2005) , and Freedman's (2006) argument on the importance of strategic communications in the transformation of strategic affairs.\nThe Soviet Understanding of War\nAn analysis of Soviet military publications indicates an exceptionally sophisticated level of professional understanding by the Warsaw Pact officers of Western military-technological innovations. What is even more striking is that the Soviets were able to place these innovations in a much deeper and broader context, reflecting a far more profound grasp of these developments' implications than the West itself\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
