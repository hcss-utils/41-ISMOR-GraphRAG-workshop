Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

This meant that there was no theater of combat, and Slipchenko suggested using the term \"theatre of war\" (Slipchenko 2005, 20) . After this initial period of the war, the United States shifted to fourth-generation warfare by deploying regular troops.\nThe objectives of earlier types of warfare were seen by Slipchenko as threefold: to rout the opponent's armed forces, to destroy its economic potential, and to overthrow or replace its political system (Slipchenko 2005, 16) . In sixth-generation warfare, which the United States was argued to be conducting, there was only one goal: to directly destroy the enemy's economic potential and to do so from a distance (Slipchenko 2002a ; see also Slipchenko 2002b) . In Yugoslavia, he saw that it was sufficient for the United States to destroy 80 percent of the adversary's economic potential, after which the citizens changed the regime by themselves (Slipchenko 2005, 32) .\nSlipchenko argued that \"no one is ever going to come to us by land again\" (Slipchenko 2005, 13) .
