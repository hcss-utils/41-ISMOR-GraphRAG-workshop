Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

'Informational pressure' on the adversary, its armed forces, state apparatus, citizens and world public opinion also produces favourable conditions for other forms of coercion. 50 Because there is no clear division of labour in the sphere of informational struggle, multiple organisations competing for resources and responsibilities within the Russian strategic community promote theory development. In the main, this discussion tends to blur any distinction between the electronic and cyber forms of informational struggle, up to their full convergence. 51 This, in turn, stimulates exploration of the digital-technological aspects of informational deterrence. Avenues of future research on the 'dialectics of deterrence' in the cyber realm, which GS experts designated in 2016, exemplify several conceptualpractical deficits in this realm. The experts call for evaluation of unacceptable damage that deters the opponent and targets selection criteria; the joint employment of cyber and conventional capabilities to optimise coercion; the formulation of an 'adequate understanding' among the adversary's decision makers of the resolve to use cyber capabilities and their effectiveness. 52 \nHow do these three forms of influence relate to each other? The term crossdomain coercion is probably the best description of the Russian art of orchestrating non-nuclear, informational and nuclear influence within a unified programme, which sometimes features in Russian writing as 'strategic deterrence'. The mechanism of this approach that has manifested itself during the recent Russian gambits\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
