Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the Russian understanding of war, Bartles continued, instead of a \"traditional\" military invasion, the United States would first install a political opposition (supported by media, social media, and nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] ), induce separatism and social strife to weaken the domestic government, and apply special or private force to provoke an overreaction, which creates a pretext for sanctions until the government collapses (Bartles 2016a, 32-33) . Thus, Bartles concluded that \"the leveraging of all means of national power to achieve the state's ends is nothing new for Russia, but now the Russian military is seeing war as being something much more than military conflict\" (Bartles 2016a, 34) . Indeed, Bartles saw that \"while the West considers these nonmilitary measures as ways of avoiding war, Russia considers these measures as war\" (Bartles 2016a, 34) . Bartles thus argues, although not explicitly, that these nonmilitary means are changing the Russian military's understanding of war away from something strictly defined by armed violence. For all its merits, Bartles's study is only eight pages long and does not delve into the questions of how theorists other than Gerasimov discussed the issue, how and when the understanding of nonmilitary means has changed, and why these means came to be seen as useful.\nBartles argued\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
